Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 92797011, I notice I have three 1s and two 9s and two 7s. Starting with a conservative but solid opening bid, I will bid 3 1s, reflecting the number of 1s I hold. This is a safe opening that puts pressure on the opponent to either raise quantity or digit.
