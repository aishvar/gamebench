Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, so the likelihood of there being more than 1 zero across both hands is low. However, since the current bid is only 1 0s, it's quite likely Player 0 has at least one zero, making the bid plausible. Instead of challenging such a conservative bid, I'll make a minimal but valid raise by choosing a digit I have multiple instances of, such as '2's (I have two 2s), and increase the quantity to 2. This is a safe and strategic move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 64815329, I have one 3. The current bid is 2 3s, so at least one more 3 would be needed in Player 0's hand to make the bid valid. Since each digit has roughly a 1/10 chance of appearing, it's plausible there is at least one other 3 in their hand, making a challenge risky. To stay safe and increase pressure, I will make a minimal raise by bidding 2 4s, which is a strictly higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). I have one 4 in my hand, so the bid is reasonable.

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 2 5s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 6, 4, 8, 1, 5, 3, 2, 9, which includes exactly one 5. The current bid is 2 5s, so for it to be valid, there must be at least one more 5 in Player 0's hand. Given the distribution, it's plausible that Player 0 has one 5, but unlikely they have two or more. Since the bid is only for 2 5s, it's quite reasonable and challenging now would be risky. To increase, I can either bid 2 6s (same quantity, higher digit), which is supported since I have one 6 myself and probability favors at least one more 6 in Player 0's hand. Alternatively, I could bid 3 2s, but since I only have one 2, that's riskier. Therefore, the safest higher bid is 2 6s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 2 7s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 64815329, I have no 7s, so the current bid of 2 7s relies entirely on Player 0 having both 7s, which is unlikely. Since Player 0 has been incrementally increasing digits without raising quantity, it suggests they might be bluffing or probing. Given the total of 16 digits and the fact I hold zero 7s, the probability of there being at least two 7s is low. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move.
