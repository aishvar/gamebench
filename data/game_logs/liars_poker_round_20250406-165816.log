Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, meaning this is the first bid. I have two 9s in my hand. A conservative but valid opening bid would be 1 9s. This is a safe starting point to gauge the opponent's hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Since the quantity is already 1, I should bid a higher digit to increase the value of the bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s. With my hand containing a 9, I can confidently make a higher bid. I'll increase the quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s is a logical next step, as it's a valid increase. Alternatively, I could bid on another digit, but since I have two 9s, it is strategically sound to continue with that digit. Bidding 3 0s would also be valid, but less informed given my hand.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s, and I have two 9s in my hand. I can safely increase the quantity to 4 9s, as I have enough 9s to support this bid. This is a reasonable move based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 9s is necessary. I can bid 5 9s, or I can bid a lower quantity with a higher digit. Considering I have a 7, bidding 5 7s is also an option. However, given the previous bids centered around 9s, it's likely the other player has some 9s as well. Bidding 5 9s seems more plausible than a higher digit with a lower quantity. Since the other player has already bid on 9s multiple times, they likely have at least one. Therefore, increasing the quantity on 9s is a reasonable strategy.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 5 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have a 9 in my hand. Considering the bid history, it's likely that Player 0 has a few more 9s. I should bid a higher quantity or digit to increase my chances of winning.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. The previous bids were all on 9s, and now the opponent switched to 0s. This could be a bluff. Bidding 7 0s is a reasonable increase, but it's risky since I only have one 0. Instead, I'll bid 6 1s. I have one 1 in my hand, and this increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. It's a slightly safer bid than increasing the quantity of 0s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand. The current bid is only 6 1s. Bidding 7 1s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 1S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 7 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. The previous bids focused heavily on 9s, then shifted to 1s. Bidding 8 1s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have one 1 to contribute. It's unlikely the other player has enough 1s to reach 7, let alone 8, but it's not so high as to be immediately suspicious. Increasing the quantity is the safest approach.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s, and I have three 1s in my hand. I don't have any other digits in high quantity, and bidding 9 1s would be a reasonable increase in both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 1S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 9 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Given the extensive bidding history focusing on 1s and 9s, it's highly probable that Player 1 is bluffing with 9 1s. While I could bid higher, challenging seems like the more strategic move. A successful challenge would likely win me the game, as it's unlikely there are 9 1s in total.
