Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 4, one 1, two 2s, one 3, one 7, one 6, and one 0. Since there's no current bid, I can make any opening bid. Having two 2s in my hand means there are at least that many, making it a safe initial bid. Starting with a moderate quantity of a digit I know I have multiple of is a good strategy.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have no 2s in my hand (07558870). For the bid to be true, the opponent must have at least two 2s. While possible, challenging such a low bid is risky. I have strong pairs in my hand: two 0s, two 5s, two 7s, and two 8s. I can make a safe higher bid. Bidding '2 5s' (or 7s or 8s) is valid and safe as I hold two of the digit. A slightly more assertive bid is '3 0s'. Since I have two 0s, this bid only requires the opponent to have one 0 out of their 8 digits, which is statistically likely (expected value is 0.8). This bid increases the quantity and puts more pressure on the opponent than simply increasing the digit.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand (at position 6). The opponent bid '3 0s', claiming there are at least 3 zeros total. Since I only have 1 zero, that means they would need to have at least 2 zeros in their hand for their bid to be valid. While possible, this seems somewhat unlikely given they could have bid something based on a different digit. Looking at my hand, I see I have two 2s, which combined with possible 2s in their hand could justify a higher bid of '4 2s'. However, a safer play would be to challenge their '3 0s' bid since I can see it's unlikely based on my hand.
