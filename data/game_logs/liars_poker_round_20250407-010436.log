Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. My hand is 41920439. I have two 9s and two 4s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. The expected number of any digit across the total 16 digits is 1.6. Bidding based on the digits I hold is a standard opening strategy. Bidding '2 9s' is a reasonable starting point, reflecting the two 9s I possess and leaving room for future bids. It's slightly higher than bidding '2 4s'.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The current bid is '2 9s', which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 2 nines in total across both our hands. Looking at my hand (01156075), I don't have any 9s. This means all claimed 9s would have to be in Player 0's hand. It's certainly possible they have 2 or more 9s, but I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Since this is the first bid and relatively low (only claiming 2 of a digit), it's reasonably likely to be true. Rather than challenging, I'll make a higher bid. Based on my hand, I have two 1s, one 0, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 0. I could bid on 1s since I have two of them, but I'll go with '3 0s' to increase the quantity, which is a valid higher bid than '2 9s'.

Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand (41920439). This means Player 1 needs to have at least two 0s for their bid to be true, which is plausible but not certain. I should consider making a higher bid based on my hand. I have two 4s and two 9s. Bidding '3 4s' would require Player 1 to have only one 4. Bidding '3 9s' would require Player 1 to have only one 9. Both seem like safe and likely true bids. My previous bid was '2 9s', so bidding '3 9s' builds on that information and leverages my strong holding of 9s. It's a valid increase from '3 0s' (same quantity, higher digit) and seems more likely to be true than challenging '3 0s'.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (01156075), I don't have any 9s. The current bid is '3 9s', which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 3 nines between our hands. Since I have zero 9s in my hand, this would mean Player 0 would need to have at least 3 nines in their hand of 8 digits. While this is possible, it's somewhat unlikely that they would have that many of a single digit. I could bid higher, but I think challenging is the better move here since I don't have any 9s and it's a relatively high claim for a single digit.
