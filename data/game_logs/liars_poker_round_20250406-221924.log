Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, ensuring that at least 2 of the highest digit are present. With 16 total digits in play and the opponent having 8 random digits, it's statistically likely that there could be an additional 9. Choosing 9 also forces the opponent to raise quantity rather than simply the digit, giving a strategic edge. Thus, the safe opening bid is 2 9s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 9s in my hand and the current bid of 3 0s requires three 0s in total. Given that I have only two 0s, the bid on 0s is borderline. Instead, I can leverage my strong holding of 9s—since I have two 9s, bidding 3 9s is a valid move (as 9 is higher than 0) and shifts the focus to a digit I hold. This makes the bid more credible and forces my opponent to decide on a tougher call.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 0s in my hand. For the current bid of 4 0s to be true, the opponent must have at least 2 additional 0s among 8 digits—a probability of roughly 18.7%. Given that there’s about an 81% chance the total number of 0s is less than 4, it’s statistically favorable to challenge this bid.
