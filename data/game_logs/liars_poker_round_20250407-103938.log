Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) making initial bid: 1 0s

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, it is very likely there are at least two zeros in total across both hands. Therefore, I can confidently increase the bid to 2 0s, which is a minimal but valid raise.

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 2 1s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (92707418), I have no 1s, so the current bid of 2 1s relies entirely on Player 0 having both 1s, which is plausible but uncertain. Since 2 is a low bid and easily achievable, challenging now is risky. Instead, I will make a minimal higher bid. I have two 0s in my hand, so bidding 3 0s is reasonable as it only requires Player 0 to have one 0, which is likely.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 1s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 92707418, I have zero 1s and two 0s. The current bid is 3 1s, which requires at least 3 ones across both hands. Given I have no 1s, all three would have to be in Player 0's hand, which is unlikely since the expected average is about 1.6 per digit across 16 digits. It is safer to challenge this bid than to raise it, as the probability Player 0 has 3 or more 1s is low.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (Naive 50/50) bid of 3 1s.
