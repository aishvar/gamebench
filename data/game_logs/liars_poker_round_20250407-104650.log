--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to open with a reasonable starting bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 9s, two 0s, one 3, one 4, and one 8. Starting with a bid on a digit I have multiple of increases my chances of success. The most common digits in my hand are 1s, 0s, and 9s, each appearing twice. Therefore, a safe and strategic opening bid would be 2 1s, as it's likely there are more in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 1 and zero 2s. The current bid is 2 2s, meaning there must be at least two 2s across both hands. Since I have no 2s, all two would need to be in Player 1's hand, which is plausible but not guaranteed. However, it's early in bidding, and it's safer to increase the bid rather than challenge such a low number. I do have two 1s, so bidding 3 1s is reasonable, as I already hold two and it's likely there's at least one more in Player 1's hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 49310918, I have zero 2s, which means all three 2s in the current bid must be in Player 1's hand. Given that, it's unlikely Player 1 actually has 3 or more 2s, since 3 is already high (almost 40% of their digits). Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 1's (Naive 50/50) bid of 3 2s.
