Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 64237501, I have one of each digit from 0 to 7, but no 8s or 9s. A conservative and reasonable opening bid is 2 of a common digit. I have two 7s, so I will open with '2 7s'.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s. If Player 0 has at least one more 7, the bid holds, but if not, it doesn't. Given the uncertainty and the low bid, challenging seems prudent.
