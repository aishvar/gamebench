Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. In my hand, I have two 3s, two 9s, one 0, one 7, one 5, and one 4. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 9s, leveraging the fact that I already hold two 9s, making it likely the total count is at least two or more.
