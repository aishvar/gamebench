Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. I should look for a high digit in my hand and try to make a reasonable bid that could be difficult for the opponent to beat. I have two 4s and two 5s, and several other digits that appear once or not at all. A bid of 3 5s seems reasonable given my hand and the goal of making it hard for my opponent to challenge.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have the digits 91213896, and I count one 5 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 4 5s seems reasonable because I know there's at least one 5 in my hand and potentially more in the other player's hand. Alternatively, bidding 3 6s is also a valid higher bid. Given that I have multiple high digits (9, 8, 6), bidding 3 9s could be a good strategy as it increases the digit significantly.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 6s and two 4s, but no 9s. I also have two 5s. Since the current bid is 3 9s, I should bid higher than 3. I can bid 4 of a digit or 3 of a higher digit. Given my hand, bidding 4 5s seems reasonable as I have two 5s and it's higher than 3 9s in quantity but not digit. However, bidding 4 6s or 4 5s seems more strategic as I have two 5s and two 6s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have the digits 91213896, which gives me a count of 1 for the digit 5. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. I see that I have a 9 and other digits, but not many 5s. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit and keeps the quantity the same, making it a valid higher bid. Alternatively, I could bid 5 5s if I believe there are at least 5 fives in total. However, given my hand and the bid history, bidding 5 0s or a similar higher quantity and digit seems too aggressive without more information. Thus, bidding 4 6s is a safe and reasonable next step.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is the better option. My hand contains two 6s and other digits, but I don't have enough information about Player 1's hand. However, given that the bid is 4 6s and I have two 6s, I should consider if I can safely increase the bid. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should look for a digit that I have in abundance or a high digit that could reasonably exist in both players' hands. I have two 6s, and the current bid is 4 6s, so bidding higher on 6s seems risky without more information. I should consider bidding on a digit that I know I have multiple instances of or increasing the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. My hand is 91213896, which contains one 6. So, I have a total of one 6. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the total count of 6s across both hands is at least one (mine) plus some unknown quantity from the other player's hand, I can try to increase the quantity or change the digit. Increasing the quantity to 6 6s seems too high given I only have one 6 and the other player likely doesn't have more than 5. However, I can bid a higher digit with the same quantity. Bidding 5 7s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit and doesn't commit to a higher quantity than the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than this. My hand contains two 6s and two 5s, among other digits. Since the bid is 5 7s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 5s and two 6s, so bidding 6 5s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid of 5 7s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I need to make a bid that is higher than this. I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand is 91213896, which contains one 5 and one 6. I can count that I have at least one 6, and potentially there are more 6s or higher digits in the other player's hand. Bidding 6 6s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit. However, considering the bid history and the fact that my opponent has already bid up to 6 5s, I should be cautious. I will bid 6 7s, increasing the digit further.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains two 6s and two 5s, among other digits. Given that the last bid was 6 7s, I must either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains two 6s, I can confidently bid on 6s or 5s. However, bidding on 7s or higher digits might be risky without knowing the distribution. I will increase the quantity and bid on a digit I have, which is 6. I will bid 7 6s, increasing the quantity.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have the digits 91213896, which means I have one 6. The total count of 6s across both hands must be at least 7 (since Player 0 made the bid). Given that I have one 6, Player 0 must have at least 6 more 6s. The bid of 7 6s is already quite high. I need to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Increasing the quantity to 8 with any digit is a possibility. However, considering my hand, I see that I have a 9, which is the highest digit. Bidding 7 9s would be a higher bid than 7 6s because 9 is greater than 6. I will analyze the likelihood of the count of 9s. I have one 9, so for 7 9s to be valid, Player 0 must have at least 6 more 9s. This seems unlikely since my hand is quite diverse and doesn't suggest that Player 0 has an unusually high count of 9s. However, it's still possible. I'll take a strategic decision based on the information available.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. I need to make a higher bid. I have two 6s and two 5s in my hand. Given that the last bid was 7 6s and I have a total of 8 digits, bidding 8 5s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and digit compared to the previous bids, and it's more likely that there are more 5s than 9s in total.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 8 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 5s. My hand is 91213896, which contains one 5. This means there are 7 remaining digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand. The total count of 5s must be at least 1 (mine) and at most 9 (if all opponent's digits were 5s). The current bid of 8 5s is within this possible range, making it a plausible bid. However, to make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 9 in my hand and the last bid involving 9s was 7 9s, I can bid higher than that by increasing the quantity. Bidding 8 9s is a valid move as it is higher than 7 9s and seems reasonable given the context.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 9s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains 2 sixes and 1 nine. Given that the bid is 8 9s, I must assess if there's a high likelihood that there are at least 8 nines in total. Since I only have 1 digit that could contribute to a 9 count (my own 1 nine), and assuming Player 1 has a reasonable distribution, it's unlikely they have more than 4 nines. With 8 being the current quantity, I have to assume they have at least 4-5 nines. I don't have enough information to safely bid higher without risking a challenge. However, I can try to make a slightly higher bid or challenge. Given my hand, bidding 9 0s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit from the current bid of 8 9s, but I must be cautious about overbidding.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 0s. My hand is 91213896, which contains one 0. To determine the likelihood of the bid being correct, I need to consider the total count of 0s. Since there are 16 digits in total and I have one 0, there are 8 other digits. Player 0 could have at most 8 0s, making the total count at most 9 (1 from me + 8 from Player 0). The bid of 9 0s is possible but on the higher end. However, given the bid history, it seems Player 0 is trying to bluff or has a strong hand in 0s and 5s initially, then switched to 0s. I should challenge the bid if I think it's unlikely. Given that I have one 0 and the maximum count is 9, and considering the aggressive bidding pattern of Player 0, it's plausible they have 8 0s. I will challenge the bid because it's a high quantity and my hand doesn't strongly support it, but the history suggests it might not be a bluff.
