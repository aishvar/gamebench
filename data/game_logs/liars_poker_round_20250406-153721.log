Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 21719893. I count 2 eights, 1 seven, 1 nine, 1 three, 1 two, and 1 one. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and a digit that is relatively common or that I have. I have two 8s, so bidding on 8s seems reasonable. I'll start with the quantity of 3 for digit 8, as it's a conservative start and slightly above what I have, considering the other player's possible hand.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. The current bid is 3 8s, which means there must be at least two more 8s in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. Since each player has 8 digits and the total number of 8s possible is 16, but having 3 or more 8s is somewhat plausible. However, bidding 4 8s would require at least 3 8s in Player 0's hand, which is less likely. Alternatively, I can bid 3 9s, which is a strictly higher bid by digit. I have one 9 in my hand, so the likelihood of there being at least two more 9s in total is similar to the current bid scenario and keeps the pressure on my opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I don't have any digits higher than 9, I need to increase the quantity. Bidding 4 9s is a reasonable move as it is a minimal increase and I know there's at least one 9 in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 4 9s, which means there must be at least three 9s in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. Given that each player has 8 digits, it's unlikely the opponent has three or more 9s, as that would require nearly half of their digits to be 9s, which is statistically improbable. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
