Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand – the only digit that appears more than once. With no current bid, it's a good opportunity to lead with what I feel most confident about. Bidding 2 1s is a conservative yet assertive opening move, leveraging the strength of my hand and leaving room for further strategic bids as the game unfolds.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 2 1s and looking at my hand (78879225), I notice I don't have any 1s. However, I do have multiple occurrences of other digits. To make a valid bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have any 1s and the current bid is low, I could consider challenging, but given the rules, I should first assess if I can make a reasonable bid based on my hand. My hand contains two 7s, two 8s, two 9s, one 2, and one 5. Bidding on any of these digits with a higher quantity than 2 seems risky without knowing the other player's hand. However, considering the low current bid, I might have an opportunity to bid on a digit I have in abundance. Given that I have two 7s, which is a higher digit than 1 and matches the current quantity, I could bid on 7s, but since I need to strictly increase the bid, I must either increase the quantity or choose a higher digit. Since my highest digit with multiple occurrences is 9 and I have two of them, I can bid on 2 9s, which is a higher digit than 1s and matches the quantity, thus being a valid bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand (5, 1, 1, 8, 4, 6, 0, 7) contains no 9s, which means all potential 9s must come from my opponent’s 8 digits. The probability that the opponent has at least two 9s is roughly 18-19%, making the current bid of '2 9s' very unlikely to be true. Given this strong statistical advantage, it is best to challenge the bid.
