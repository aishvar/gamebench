Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game, and I need to make a strategic opening. Looking at my hand (91477040), I have one 9, one 1, two 7s, one 4, one 0, and no 2s, 3s, 5s, or 6s. The most frequent digit in my hand is 7, which appears twice. Since this is the opening bid, I want to make a conservative yet strategic bid. I'll bid based on what I know for certain (my two 7s) plus a reasonable guess that my opponent might have at least one 7. Bidding '3 7s' is reasonable - it accounts for my two 7s and assumes at least one more from my opponent, which is plausible with 8 random digits in their hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (91478202), I have one 7. For the bid '3 7s' to be true, Player 0 would need to have at least two 7s in their hand. While possible, I can see that I have a strong alternative: I notice I have two 8s in my hand. Since 8 is higher than 7, I can maintain the same quantity (3) but increase the digit to 8s, which I'm more confident about given my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to evaluate the current bid of '3 8s' against my hand. Looking at my hand (91477040), I don't have any 8s. This means all 3 claimed 8s would have to be in my opponent's hand. While this is possible, it's somewhat unlikely that they would have exactly 3 of the same digit. I have two 7s in my hand, which is why I initially bid '3 7s', expecting my opponent might have at least one more 7. I could bid '3 9s' which would be valid (same quantity, higher digit) and I do have one 9 in my hand. Alternatively, I could bid '4 0s', '4 4s', or '4 7s' since I have these digits in my hand. I think bidding '4 0s' is reasonable as I have one 0 and need my opponent to have at least 3 more, which is possible but not guaranteed. I'll go with this bid to increase the quantity and make it harder for my opponent.

Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. The opponent bid 4 0s, meaning they're claiming there are at least 4 zeros total between our hands. Since I can see two 0s in my own hand, their bid of 4 0s is quite plausible - they likely have at least two 0s themselves. Given this, challenging would be risky. I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I see I have one 1, which isn't enough to confidently bid five 0s or 1s. However, I can see one 2, so bidding '4 2s' would be a safe move - it's a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit) while not making too aggressive a claim.

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current state of the game. Looking at my hand (91477040), I have zero 2s. The current bid is 4 2s, which means my opponent is claiming there are at least 4 twos between our hands. Since I have none, all 4 would have to be in my opponent's hand. This is possible but requires my opponent to have half their hand as 2s. Looking at the bid history, my opponent raised from my 4 0s to 4 2s, which suggests they might have some 2s. I have one 0, one 1, one 4, two 7s, one 9, and no 2s, 3s, 5s, or 6s. I could bid 4 3s, but that would be a complete bluff. I could bid 4 4s, which is slightly better since I have one 4. I could bid 4 5s, 4 6s, or 4 7s (I have two 7s, making 4 7s more plausible). I could also bid 4 8s or 4 9s. Since I have two 7s, bidding 4 7s seems reasonable. My opponent would need to have at least two 7s for this to be true, which is possible but not guaranteed. I'll go with 4 7s as my bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I can see one 7 in my hand (91478202). The opponent bid 4 7s, claiming there are at least four 7s total between both hands. Since I only have one 7, that means they would need to have at least three 7s in their hand to make this bid true. While possible, this seems unlikely given the previous bidding pattern and that they raised their own 3 7s bid to 4 7s. I should challenge rather than make a higher bid.
