Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there has been no bid yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 3s, two 0s, one 1, one 4, one 5, and one 6. The most common digits are 2s, 3s, and 0s, each appearing twice. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 3 2s, assuming the opponent may have at least one 2 as well.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 2. For the current bid of '3 2s' to be valid, Player 0 would need to have at least two 2s in their hand. While possible, I have strong digits in my hand (two 4s) that I can use to make a strategic bid. Since I have two 4s, bidding '3 4s' would be a safe play - it only requires Player 0 to have one more 4 to be valid, and it's a higher bid than '3 2s' because 4 is a higher digit than 2.

Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 4s. The current bid is 3 4s, so for that bid to be valid, the opponent would only need to have at least one 4, which is quite plausible. Therefore, challenging now is risky. To continue, I can increase the bid to 3 5s since I have one 5, and it's a minimal raise that doesn't commit me too much.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The opponent bid '3 5s', meaning they believe there are at least 3 fives total. Given I only have one 5, they would need to have at least 2 fives in their hand for this to be true. While possible, I can make a safer bid based on what I know from my hand. I have two 4s, so bidding '4 4s' is a reasonable move - it increases the quantity while staying with a digit I know I have multiple of.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 4S'
Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 4s. The current bid is 4 4s, which would require at least two more 4s in the opponent's hand to be valid. Since the probability of the opponent having two or more 4s is relatively low (about 20-25%), it's risky to assume the bid is truthful. The likelihood that there are four or more total 4s is not high enough to justify making a higher bid, so the best strategic move is to challenge.
