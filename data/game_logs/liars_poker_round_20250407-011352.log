Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. My hand is 32175461. I have two 1s, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. A safe opening bid is usually based on the digits I hold. Bidding '2 1s' is guaranteed to be true just from my hand and sets a reasonable starting point for the bidding.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '1' in my hand, and the current bid is 2 1s. I can increase the quantity while maintaining the same digit. Bidding 3 1s is a valid move since it is higher than the current bid.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 3 1s

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 32175461, which contains two 1s. The current bid is 3 1s, made by Player 1 after I bid 2 1s. For the current bid of 3 1s to be true, Player 1 needs at least one 1 (since I have two). Player 1 raising my bid suggests they likely have at least one 1, making a challenge risky (I would lose if they have one or more 1s). I need to make a higher bid. Options include bidding on a different digit (e.g., 3 2s) or increasing the quantity of 1s. Since I have two 1s and Player 1 showed interest in 1s by raising the bid, bidding 4 1s seems like a strong strategic move. This requires Player 1 to have at least two 1s. While this is more than the statistical average (0.8), Player 1's bid of 3 1s makes it plausible they hold one or even two 1s. Bidding 4 1s leverages my hand's strength and puts pressure back on Player 1 based on the bidding history.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand, making the current bid of 4 1s seem plausible. However, to make a valid higher bid, I can bid 5 1s, which is a reasonable increase in quantity while staying with the same digit.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 5 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand (32175461). The current bid is 5 1s, made by Player 1. This bid requires there to be at least five 1s in total across both hands (16 digits). For the bid to be true, Player 1 must have at least 5 - 2 = 3 ones in their 8-digit hand. While possible, the probability of a player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is statistically low (roughly 4% using binomial approximation). The bidding escalated quickly on 1s (2 1s -> 3 1s -> 4 1s -> 5 1s). My last bid was 4 1s, based on my two 1s. Player 1's raise to 5 1s seems aggressive and is statistically unlikely to be true. Making a higher bid (like 6 1s or 5 2s) is not supported by my hand. Therefore, challenging the bid of 5 1s is the most strategically sound move.
