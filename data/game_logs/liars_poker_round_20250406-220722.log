Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 3 5s as the first move is strategic because it increases the quantity from the starting point and uses a mid-range digit. The opponent's 8 digits likely include at least one 5, making this bid plausible while setting a moderate challenge for the next player.

Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. Bidding 4 9s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. My hand contains no 9s, so the opponent must have all four 9s for their bid to be valid. Since the probability of the opponent holding four 9s in their 8-digit hand is extremely low (expected ~0.8 9s), challenging is the optimal play.
