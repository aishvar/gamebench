Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game, so I want to start with a conservative yet reasonable bid. My hand contains two 2s, two 9s, two 0s, one 1, and one 7. Statistically, with 16 digits total, a safe opening bid is usually around 3 of a common digit. Since I have two 2s, bidding 3 2s is reasonable, as it's likely the opponent has at least one more 2 in their hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 2s, two 9s, two 0s, one 1, and one 7. The current bid is 3 3s, but I have zero 3s in my hand. Since I hold none, the opponent would need all three 3s alone, which is unlikely given the distribution. It's safer to challenge now as the probability of there being at least three 3s across both hands is low.
