Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Since we haven't seen any bids yet, opening with 3 7s is a reasonable initial guess that there's at least one more 7 among the other player's digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The opponent bid 3 7s total, meaning they're claiming there are at least 2 more 7s in their hand. While possible, I have strong digits I can bid with instead. I see a 9 and an 8 in my hand, so I can safely bid '3 8s' which is higher than '3 7s' while keeping the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, so raising to 4 7s seems plausible. Needing two more 7s out of the other eight digits isn't unlikely, making this a reasonable higher bid than 3 8s.

Player 0 bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The opponent has bid 4 7s, suggesting they might have 3 or more 7s. While possible, this seems unlikely given they started with 3 7s and raised to 4 7s after my 3 8s bid. They might be bluffing. With only one 7 in my hand, for their bid to be true, they would need at least 3 7s in their hand. Given the probability and their bidding pattern, challenging seems safer than making a higher bid.
