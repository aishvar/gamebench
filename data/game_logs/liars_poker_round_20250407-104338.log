Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative opening bid. I have two 8s in my hand, so I will bid 3 8s, which is a slight increase to account for the possibility of the other player also having some 8s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Since the previous bid was 3 8s, and I have two 8s, I could bid 4 8s. However, given the current bid of 3 9s, a safer move is to bid 4 0s, as I have one 0 in my hand. This increases the quantity and is a valid bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. Since the previous bids have been relatively low, and the current bid is only 4, I will increase the quantity to 5 and bid 5 2s. This is a safe increase.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. I could bid 6 3s, or I could bid 5 of a higher number. I'll bid 6 0s, since the previous bid was 4 0s, and it might throw off my opponent.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. I could bid 6 of a higher number, but I don't know what the opponent has. I could also bid a higher quantity. Since the opponent is Naive 50/50, I will raise the quantity to 7. I will choose a digit I don't have, so I choose 5.
