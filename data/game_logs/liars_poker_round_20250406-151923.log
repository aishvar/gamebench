Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening bid and no previous bids exist, I want to start with a conservative but credible bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, two 7s, one 3, one 5, one 6, and one 2. The most frequent digits in my hand are 4s and 7s, each appearing twice. Assuming the opponent's hand is random, starting with a bid of 3 4s is reasonable, as it's likely there is at least one 4 in their hand, making the total at least three or more.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have one 2 and no 4s in my hand. The total count of 4s across both hands must be at least 3. It's possible that Player 0 has multiple 4s. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 3 5s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and is a relatively safe bet given that I have no information about the count of 5s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand, so to meet the current bid of 3 5s, the opponent would need at least two 5s. This is plausible. To raise, I can either increase the digit or the quantity. Since I have three 7s, it makes sense to bid 3 7s, which is a higher digit with the same quantity, and well-supported by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have one 7, and there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's, it's possible there are at least 3 7s in total. I will increase the quantity to 4. Bidding on 7s again or a higher digit is reasonable. I'll bid 4 7s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 43654772, I have three 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, which would require my opponent to have at least one 7 for the bid to be valid. Given that I hold three 7s, it's somewhat plausible they have one, but unlikely they have more. Bidding 5 7s would be risky, as it would require my opponent to have at least two 7s, which is improbable. Alternatively, raising the digit with the same quantity (e.g., 4 8s) is less safe since I have zero 8s. Therefore, the most strategic move is to challenge, as the current bid of 4 7s is unlikely to be supported by our combined hands.
