Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have the digits 4, 9, 5, 8, 6, 2, 7, and 6 in my hand. Since there are no previous bids, I need to make a bid. A reasonable starting bid could be 1 of a digit that I have, such as 1 4s, to establish a presence in the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 4s, but two 5s and two 3s. Since the current bid is only 1 4s, it is very likely that there is at least one 4 in the opponent's hand, making a challenge risky. A safe and minimal raise would be to bid 1 5s, which is higher due to the digit, and since I already have two 5s, this is a very safe bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand and no 5s. The current bid is only 1 5s, which is quite low. I can raise the bid by increasing the quantity to 2 and choosing a digit that I have, which is 6. This makes my bid 2 6s, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 0 bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 6s, so the current bid of 2 6s relies entirely on my opponent having both or at least one 6. With 16 digits total, it's plausible there are two 6s, but since I have none, it's somewhat risky to assume. However, challenging now is risky because two 6s is quite reasonable statistically. Instead, I will make a minimal higher bid by increasing the quantity to 2 but on a digit I have more of, to keep the pressure on. I have three 5s, so bidding 3 5s is a safe and strategic increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand, which means there is at least one 5 present. The current bid is 3 5s. Since I have a 5, I can confidently bid a higher quantity of 5s. I will bid 4 5s, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 0 bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 23131558, I have two 5s. The current bid is 4 5s, which means there must be at least two more 5s in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. That's plausible, but uncertain. To outbid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I also have two 3s and two 1s, bidding 4 8s (I have two 8s) is a reasonable way to raise the digit while keeping quantity the same, leveraging my strong count of 8s. This is safer than challenging now, as 4 5s is still quite plausible.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s and one 7 in my hand, but no 8s. The current bid is 4 8s, which seems unlikely since I don't have any 8s. Given that there are only 16 digits total, I doubt there are 4 8s in play. Therefore, I should challenge the last bid.
