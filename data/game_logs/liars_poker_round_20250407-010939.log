Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first turn, so there is no current bid. I have two 2s, one 4, one 6, one 7, one 3, and one 9 in my hand. A reasonable opening bid would be to start with a low quantity and a common digit. I'll bid 2 2s since I already have two 2s in my hand, making this a safe and strategic opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 2s'. I have one '2' in my hand (90920755). This means the bid is true if the opponent (Player 0) has at least one '2' in their 8 digits. Challenging this low bid is risky as it's quite likely to be true. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two '0's, two '5's, and two '9's. I can make a safe bid based on my hand like '2 5s' or '2 9s'. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity. Bidding '3 0s' leverages my two '0's and requires only one '0' from the opponent's 8 digits, which is statistically plausible. This increases the quantity, putting more pressure than simply increasing the digit to '2 3s' or higher. Therefore, bidding '3 0s' is a reasonable next step.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, which makes it less likely that there are at least 3 0s across both hands. Given that the total number of digits is 16, and I already know 8 of them, it seems improbable that the remaining 8 digits could contain 3 or more 0s. I will challenge the current bid as it seems unlikely to be valid.
