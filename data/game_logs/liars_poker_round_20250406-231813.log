--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 4s, one 2, one 7, one 6, and one 1. The most frequent digit in my hand is 9 or 4, both appearing twice. A conservative and strategic opening bid would be 2 9s, reflecting my strong count in that digit and leaving room to escalate.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s. Bidding 3 8s increases the quantity while leveraging my strong holding of 8s. Even if the opponent has no 8s, the total count (3) would still meet the bid, making this a safe and strategic move.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s and no 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, which requires at least three 8s among the total 16 digits. Since I have zero 8s, my opponent would need to have all three 8s, which is somewhat unlikely but not impossible. However, given that I have two 9s, a safer and strategic move is to outbid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving from 3 8s to 3 9s. This bid is plausible based on my hand and places pressure back on my opponent.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, meaning the opponent must have at least two 9s. Given that the probability of them having two or more 9s in their 8-digit hand is relatively low (approximately 18.7% assuming uniform distribution), challenging is statistically favorable. Additionally, their initial bid of 2 9s and subsequent raise to 3 9s after my 3 8s could indicate a bluff, as they might not hold sufficient 9s to justify the bid.
