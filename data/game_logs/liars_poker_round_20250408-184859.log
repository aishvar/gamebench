Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make an initial bid. I have two 0s, two 2s, and one 5, among other digits. Bidding 2 0s seems reasonable to start, as it's a digit I have and sets a foundation for future bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, making it less likely that there are 2 or more 0s across both hands. However, 2 0s is a modest opening bid, and it's quite plausible Player 0 holds both 0s or one 0, and I don't want to challenge such a low bid immediately. Instead, I can confidently raise based on my strong digits. I have two 6s and two 7s, so bidding 3 6s is a safe and strictly higher bid (higher quantity and digit).

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s and one 2 in my hand, but no 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, which I cannot meet with my hand. However, I can increase the quantity by bidding 4 0s, which is a digit I have and is a valid move since it increases the quantity while changing the digit as well.

Player 0 bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s (digits are 6, 2, 6, 5, 3, 7, 4, 6). The current bid is 4 0s, which means my opponent is implying there are at least four zeros across both hands. Since I have zero, all four would need to be in their hand, which is unlikely as that would be half of their digits. Therefore, it is improbable that there are 4 or more zeros total, making this a good opportunity to challenge.
