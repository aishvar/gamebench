Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 0s in my hand. Assuming the other player also has a reasonable distribution of digits, bidding on the digit '0' with a quantity of 3 is a safe starting point. This bid is likely to be valid and sets a baseline for further bidding.

Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. The digit '0' appears twice in my hand. Assuming the opponent has a similar distribution, a bid of 4 for the digit '0' seems reasonable as a starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (54189274), there are zero 0s. The current bid is 3 zeros across both hands. Since I hold none, the entire count of zeros depends solely on Player 0's hand. For their bid of 3 zeros to be valid, they would need to have all 3 zeros, which is somewhat unlikely given the uniform distribution of digits (each digit appears roughly 1.6 times on average in 8 digits). While it's possible Player 0 has 3 zeros, it's statistically improbable, making a challenge favorable here over raising the bid.
