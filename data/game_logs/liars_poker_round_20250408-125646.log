Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s is a strong opening move since 9 is the highest digit, making it harder for the opponent to raise the digit further. The bid is plausible as the opponent might have one more 9 in their 8 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 37664412, containing no digit '9'. The opponent bid 3 '9's, meaning they likely have multiple '9's themselves. However, since I have zero '9's, the opponent would need to have all three '9's in their own hand to meet the bid. Given that each player has 8 digits, it's plausible they could have three '9's, but it's risky. Still, the bid of 3 '9's is relatively low, and challenging at this early stage without any '9's myself might be risky. Instead, I can safely bid higher on a digit I have multiple copies of. I have two '4's and two '6's. I'll choose digit '4' and raise the quantity to 4, since having two myself makes it reasonably likely there are at least two more across the opponent's hand.

Player 1 bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. My hand has only one 4. To meet the bid, the opponent must have at least three 4s. Given the low probability of the opponent having three 4s in their 8 digits, challenging is likely advantageous. Additionally, raising the bid to 4 of a higher digit (e.g., 9s) risks an even lower total count. Challenging maximizes the chance of winning if the bid is incorrect.
