Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two 7s in my hand, I can start with a conservative bid that is likely to be true based on my own hand. Bidding '2 7s' is a safe starting point as it is already true in my hand and gives me room to adjust based on future bids.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 sevens. Looking at my hand (60029354), I have zero 7s. Since I don't have any 7s, the entire count of sevens depends on Player 0's hand. For the bid of 2 sevens to be valid, Player 0 must have both sevens, which is possible but somewhat unlikely given the total of 8 digits. Given this low probability and that challenging now could win the round if Player 0 overbid, it is strategically sound to challenge the bid rather than increase it.
