Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 9s, one 8, one 3, one 4, and one 0. A conservative but solid opening bid is 2 9s, as I hold two 9s myself, making it quite likely there are at least two 9s across both hands.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 2 and two 6s and other digits in my hand, but no 9s. The quantity is low, and it's possible that the total count of 9s is indeed 2 across both hands. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 9s, I'll increase the digit. Bidding 2 0s is a reasonable next step as it meets the criteria of being a higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have the hand 61062272, which contains one 6, one 0, two 2s, one 7, and two other digits. My hand has no 9s. The bid of 2 9s implies that there are at least two 9s in total. Given that I have no 9s, it's possible that the other player has at least two 9s. However, I can bid higher than 2 9s by either increasing the quantity or bidding the same quantity with a higher digit. Since my hand has a 0 and a 2, and possibly other digits that could be in common with the opponent's hand, I can make an educated guess. I will increase the quantity and bid 3 0s, as it's a relatively safe and higher bid compared to 2 9s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '59958340', I have one 0. The current bid is 3 0s, meaning the total zeroes across both hands should be at least 3. Since I only have one, the opponent would need at least two zeroes. This is somewhat plausible but not guaranteed. Instead of challenging now, a safer strategy is to raise the bid based on my strong count of 9s â€” I have three 9s, making a bid of 3 9s very solid and strictly higher (same quantity but higher digit). This pressures the opponent without overcommitting.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand contains the digits 6, 1, 0, 6, 2, 2, 7, 2. I see one 0 in my hand. The previous bid was 3 0s, indicating that Player 0 likely doesn't have many 0s. I have to make a bid that is higher than 3 9s. I can either bid a quantity higher than 3 or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, I must increase the quantity. Thus, bidding 4 0s or 4 1s could be reasonable. However, I see one 0 and no 1s in my hand, so bidding 4 0s seems more likely to be true than 4 1s because it is based on observed information. Therefore, I will bid 4 0s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s and three 9s. The current bid is 4 0s, which would require there to be at least two more 0s in the opponent's hand. Since 4 0s is plausible, challenging now is risky. However, I have three 9s, and the last bid for 9s was only 3 9s. Therefore, a safe and valid higher bid is 4 9s, which increases the quantity and is supported strongly by my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. Since the maximum quantity is 16 and there are 8 digits per player, the highest possible quantity is 16. I have the digits 61062272, which means I have 2, 6, and 7. Notably, I don't have 9s, and my highest digit is 7. The current bid of 4 9s is already quite high for 9s, given that I don't have any 9s and the opponent likely doesn't have many either. However, I can still bid higher by increasing the quantity or changing the digit. Bidding 5 0s seems like a reasonable move as it increases the quantity. However, considering the bid history, Player 0 initially bid 2 9s and then increased to 3 9s and then to 4 9s. This indicates they might have some 9s. I should consider a bid that reflects a potentially higher count of a different digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 59958340, I have two 0s. The current bid is 5 0s, which would require my opponent to have at least three 0s for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution of digits and the unlikelihood of the opponent holding three or more 0s (as that would be nearly 40% of their hand), I find it improbable that there are 5 or more 0s in total. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
