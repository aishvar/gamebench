Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one each of 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, and two 1s. Starting with a conservative yet reasonable opening bid, I'll choose 2 1s, because I already have two 1s myself, making the bid very safe.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 03615819, I have zero 2s. Since the current bid is only 2 2s, it's quite plausible the opponent has two 2s or one 2, making the total at least two. It's risky to challenge now. To safely outbid, I can increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 1s in my hand, so a bid of 3 1s is reasonable because the opponent likely has at least one 1, making three 1s plausible.
