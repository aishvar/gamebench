Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand '92139501', the digit '1' appears twice, and '9' appears twice as well. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will choose '2 1s' because '1's tend to be safe early bids and I have two of them myself, making it likely there are more in total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 1s'. I need to assess my hand to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. My hand is '62678607'. I count the occurrences of '1' in my hand, which is 0. Since there are 2 players and each has 8 digits, the total count of '1s' across both hands can't exceed 16. The current bid is 2, which is relatively low. I see that I have 0 '1s', so the total count of '1s' is at least 2 (from Player 0's hand). I can either challenge or bid higher. Bidding higher could be '3 1s' or '2 0s' (since 0 is the next lower digit and my hand has several other digits). However, given that the bid is not extremely high and I have no '1s', I will bid higher on a different digit. I count my digits: 6 appears 3 times, 2 appears 2 times, 7 appears 2 times, 8 appears 1 time, and 0 appears 1 time. I can bid '2 0s' as it's a valid higher bid than '2 1s' because it is on a lower digit.

Player 1 response was not valid JSON: '{"reasoning": "The current bid is 2 1s. I have 0 '1's in my hand. To assess the likelihood of the bid being correct, I need to consider that there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand, making a total of 16 digits. The bid suggests that there are at least 2 '1's across both hands. Since I have 0 '1's, the opponent must have at least 2 '1's for the bid to be valid. Given that the maximum number of '1's I could have is 0, and the bid is relatively low (2 1s), it's plausible that the opponent has at least 2 '1's. I will make a higher bid to continue the game, choosing a higher digit to bid on. I will bid on '2's because my hand has multiple '2's and it's a relatively safe bid to make given the information I have.", "action": "BID: Q 2s".replace('Q', '3')}'

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have 62678607, which contains no 1s. Assuming the opponent's hand is random, the expected number of 1s in their hand is 0.8 (since they have 8 digits and the probability of each being 1 is 0.1). The total expected number of 1s across both hands is 0.8 (since I have 0). The bid of 2 1s is higher than the expected total, but not extremely high. However, given that I have no 1s, it's plausible that the opponent has more than the expected number of 1s. To proceed, I can either challenge or bid higher. A reasonable next bid would be to bid on a different digit or increase the count. I have 2 sixes, so bidding on 6s could be a good strategy. The next bid should be higher than 2 1s, so I can bid '3 1s' or '2 6s'. Since '2 6s' is a valid bid and I have 2 sixes, it's a reasonable choice.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 92139501, which contains zero 6s. The current bid is 2 6s, implying there are at least two 6s across both hands. Since I have none, both 6s would need to be in Player 1's hand. This is possible but somewhat unlikely, as having exactly two 6s among eight digits is not guaranteed. However, it's plausible enough that challenging now might be premature. A safe and strategic approach is to raise the bid modestly. The lowest valid raise is to increase the digit (because the quantity is the same). The next digit after 6 is 7, so I can bid 2 7s, which is a minimal legal raise and puts pressure back on Player 1 without overcommitting.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have the digits 62678607, which means I have 2 sixes and 1 seven. The total count of 7s across both hands must be at least 1 (from my hand) + unknown (from Player 0's hand). Since Player 0 bid 2 7s, it implies they likely have at least 1 seven. Thus, the total count of 7s could be 2 or more. I should either challenge if I think it's unlikely or bid higher. Given that I have a relatively high count of 6s (2 sixes), I can bid higher on 6s. The next possible bid exceeding '2 7s' could be '3 6s' or any digit higher than 7. Since I have 2 sixes, I can confidently bid '3 6s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 sixes across both hands. Looking at my hand (92139501), I have zero sixes. For the bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least 3 sixes. Since each player has 8 digits, having 3 or more sixes in one hand is possible but statistically unlikely. Given I hold none, the probability that the opponent holds all 3 or more sixes is low. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move here.
