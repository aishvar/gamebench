Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, which guarantees that there are at least two 9s in play. With no current bid and 16 total digits between both players, starting low with a bid that I can safely back up is a smart move. This bid forces my opponent to either raise the bid or risk challenging a claim I know is true.
