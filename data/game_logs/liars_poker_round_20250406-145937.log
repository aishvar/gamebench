Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 7s, one 1, one 5, one 6, and one 8. Statistically, the most common digits in all players' combined 24 digits should be around 2-3 copies per digit. Opening conservatively with 3 of a digit I have multiple of is reasonable. Given I have two 7s, starting with '3 7s' is a safe and strategic opening bid.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand is 75134968. I have one 7 and no information about the other players' hands. A reasonable next bid could be higher in quantity or digit. I have a 7 in my hand, so bidding a higher quantity or digit seems feasible. The bid '4 7s' seems reasonable as it increases the quantity while I have a 7 in my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s and one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. Bidding 5 6s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity and digit based on my hand. I could also challenge, but I don't have enough information to be confident that 4 7s is an invalid bid.

Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (1,5,6,7,0,7,8,0), I have one 6. The current bid is 5 6s, so there need to be at least 4 more 6s among the other 16 digits. Statistically, about 1.6 occurrences per digit are expected (16/10 â‰ˆ 1.6), making 4 additional 6s somewhat plausible but not certain. Since the bid is modest and not outrageous, challenging now is risky. The safest strategic move is to increase the bid slightly, choosing a digit for which I have some presence. I have two 7s, so bidding 5 7s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. Given that I have a 7 in my hand and the total count of 7s could reasonably be high, I should consider if I can make a higher bid. My hand contains a 7, so I know there is at least one 7. The bid needs to be higher than 5 7s, so I must bid more than 5 or a higher digit with the same quantity. Since my hand is 75134968, I have 2 sevens, which makes 3 sevens in total if I add my own, making 5 sevens plausible but not certain. I will increase the quantity to 6 and bid on a higher digit, 8s, as I have multiple 8s and 6s in my hand, making it a strong possibility.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 8s

--- Turn: Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are 6 8s in total across all hands. Challenging seems like the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) challenges Player 1's (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bid of 6 8s.
Revealed Hands: P0(openrouter/quasar-alpha):15670780 | P1(meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor):75134968 | P2(mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor):20765492
Actual count of 8s across all hands: 2
