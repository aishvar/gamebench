Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can start with any valid bid. I have three 8s in my hand. Bidding 4 8s seems reasonable, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 8.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (29161900), I have no 8s. Since there are 16 digits total, for the bid of 4 8s to be valid, the opponent must have at least 4 8s in their hand. This is unlikely given the distribution of digits, as having 4 or more of a single digit in an 8-digit hand is rare. Therefore, I suspect the opponent is bluffing or overestimating, and challenging is the best move.
