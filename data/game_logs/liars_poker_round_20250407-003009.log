Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. I have two 9s in my hand, which is a strong starting point. Bidding 3 9s seems reasonable, as it's likely there's at least one more 9 in the other player's hand, and this bid is higher than 'None' in both quantity and digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. I could bid higher, but I don't have enough information to confidently increase the bid. Since the bid is relatively low, and I only have one 9, it's risky to assume there are at least 3 nines in total. I'll challenge.
