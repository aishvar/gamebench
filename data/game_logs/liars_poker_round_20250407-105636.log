Player 0 (Naive) making initial bid: 1 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible. To safely increase the bid, I can bid 1 1s, which is a minimal increment and keeps me in the game without overcommitting.

Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 1 2s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 1 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I can see one 2 in my hand, which supports the current bid of 1 2s. Since the minimum next bid is either 2 of any digit or 1 3s, I should make a safe incremental bid. I have two 3s in my hand, which makes bidding 2 3s a solid choice, as it is likely there are at least two 3s across both hands.

Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 2 4s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 4. The current bid is 2 4s, so for that bid to be true, Player 0 must have at least one 4, which is plausible. To raise, I can either bid 2 5s or increase the quantity. I have two 0s, so bidding 2 0s is not valid as it's lower digit-wise. I also have one 5, one 6, one 8, and one 9, so bidding 2 5s is a safe minimal raise. Since it's early and the bid is still low, a conservative incremental bid is reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 2 6s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 82346509, I have one 6. The current bid is 2 6s, so at least one more 6 would need to be in Player 0's hand to make the bid plausible. Since it's quite reasonable that among 8 unknown digits there is at least one 6, challenging now would be premature. The minimum valid next bid is 2 7s, which is a modest increase. Given my hand contains one 7, bidding 2 7s is a safe incremental raise.
