Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 0s, one 6, one 8, one 7, and one 4. A common opening strategy is to bid on a digit I have multiple copies of. I have two 5s and two 0s, so bidding '2 5s' or '2 0s' is reasonable. I'll choose '2 5s' as 5 is a mid-range digit, which tends to be a safer opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. Bidding 2 6s raises the digit value while keeping the quantity the same, making it a valid higher bid. I have one 6 in my hand, so if the opponent has at least one 6, the bid holds. This shifts focus to a different digit, reducing the likelihood of an immediate challenge.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 60857451, I have one 6. Since the current bid is 2 6s, and I hold one, it's quite plausible that my opponent has at least one 6, making their bid reasonable. To increase the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep it the same and bid a higher digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, so bidding 3 5s is a logical step, as it is a higher quantity and I know I hold two of them, making a total of at least two, and likely more in total. Therefore, bidding 3 5s is a safe and strategic move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. Bidding 3 6s increases the digit to a higher number while keeping the same quantity, which is a valid bid. I have one 6 in my hand, and if the opponent has at least two 6s, the bid holds. This avoids increasing the quantity, which might be riskier given limited information.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6. The current bid is 3 6s, so for that to be valid, there must be at least two more 6s in Player 1's hand. Given that on average each digit appears about 1.6 times per player, 3 total 6s is plausible. Raising the bid to 4 6s would require at least three more 6s in Player 1's hand, which is unlikely. Alternatively, I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity. I have two 5s, so bidding 3 7s or higher without strong evidence would be risky. Since I have limited information and the current bid is plausible but not guaranteed, the best strategy is to challenge and test if Player 1 really has at least two 6s.
