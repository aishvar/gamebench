Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains the digits 0, 9, 4, 9, 5, 6, 8, 7. I see that I have two 9s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and there are 3 players, I should start with a conservative bid that seems likely to be valid but also leaves room for others to have the digit. Bidding 2 9s seems reasonable as it's based on my own hand and leaves room for others to have the digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s, which reduces the likelihood that there are at least two 9s among all 24 digits. Since Player 0 bid 2 9s, it's plausible but not certain there are two 9s total. However, challenging now is risky because two 9s across three players is quite reasonable. To stay safe and maintain pressure, I will increase the bid by keeping the quantity the same and choosing a higher digit. The next higher digit after 9 is not possible, so I must increase the quantity instead. I'll bid 3 of a digit I have multiples of to make my bid more credible. I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding 3 8s is reasonable.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. It's reasonable to assume that there are more 8s in the other players' hands, but it's unlikely that there are more than 5 8s in total. Bidding 4 8s is a safe increase, but to be more strategic, I'll bid 3 9s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, as I have one 9 in my hand.

Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Given that the bid is 3 9s, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit to make a valid higher bid. Since my hand contains two 9s, I can confidently bid higher. The bid of 4 0s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (83072465), I have exactly one 0. The current bid is 4 zeros, which implies at least three zeros are distributed among the other two players' 16 digits. Statistically, zeros are less common, and 4 zeros out of 24 total digits is on the higher side but still plausible. However, moving to a bid of 4 1s or 4 2s would be safer if I have multiple of those digits. Counting my hand, I have one 2, no 1s, two 3s, one 4, one 5, two 6s, one 7, two 8s, and no 9s. Since I have two 6s and two 8s, a bid of 4 6s or 4 8s would be a reasonable and safe increase over 4 0s, especially since 4 0s is already a bit risky. I will bid 4 6s to increase the digit to one I have good coverage in.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 6s

Requesting action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 7s in my hand. Since 7 is higher than 6, I can make a valid bid by increasing the digit. Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable move based on the information available.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. Given my hand (09495687), I have a total of 3 sevens are not present but I do have a 7 and other high digits. I can see if I bid higher than 4, or even the same quantity with a higher digit, it could be advantageous. My hand contains one 7, and I see an opportunity to bid higher with a different digit. Since I have two 6s and the current bid is 4 7s, I can try to bid higher with a digit I have. I will bid 5 6s as I have two 6s, which seems reasonable and higher than the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (83072465), I have two 6s. The current bid is 5 6s, meaning there must be at least five 6s among all 24 digits. Since I hold two, the remaining players would need to collectively have at least three more 6s, which is plausible but on the higher side. Given that the bid is already at five 6s, pushing it further would be risky without strong evidence, and challenging now is sensible because the probability that there are five or more total 6s is borderline. Therefore, I will challenge.
