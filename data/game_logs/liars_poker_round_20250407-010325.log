--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The current bid is '2 9s', which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 2 nines between both our hands. Looking at my hand (05620856), I have zero 9s. This means all claimed 9s would have to be in Player 0's hand. Since Player 0 opened with a relatively low bid of just 2 9s, it's quite possible they have 2 or more 9s in their hand. I could challenge, but it seems risky as the bid is quite reasonable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, one 2, one 5, two 6s, and two 8s. I could bid '3 0s', '3 2s', '3 5s', '3 6s', or '3 8s'. Since I have two 8s in my hand, bidding '3 8s' seems safest as I only need Player 0 to have one 8 for this to be true. Alternatively, I could bid '3 6s' since I also have two 6s. I'll go with '3 8s' as 8 is a higher digit than 6.

Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. I could bid higher, but it would be a pure bluff. Given that the previous bids were relatively low (2 9s and 3 8s), it's not unreasonable to think there might not be that many 8s in total. I will challenge to try and gain an advantage.
