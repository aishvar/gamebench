Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, I know for certain there are at least 2 zeros in total. Therefore, I can safely raise the bid to 2 0s, which is a strictly higher bid and well supported by my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 1s, which already accounts for the entire current bid of 2 1s. Since it is quite likely that the opponent has at least one more 1 or other digits, challenging now is risky. A safe strategy is to increment the bid modestly, preferably on a digit where I have good representation. I have two 9s, so bidding 2 9s would not be strictly higher. Instead, I can increase the quantity to 3 and select a digit I hold multiple of. I have two 9s and two 1s, so bidding 3 1s is a straightforward valid raise, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same.
