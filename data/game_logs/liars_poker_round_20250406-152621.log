Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 38132924, which contains two 2s, one 3, one 8, one 9, and one 4. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the count of digits in my hand. I see that 2 is the most frequent digit with 2 occurrences. I will bid 2 2s as it's a conservative start and reflects some information from my hand.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 2s in my hand, making it less likely that there are more than 2 total 2s across both hands. Since the current bid is only 2 2s, it's quite plausible that opponent has two or more 2s, so challenging now is risky. Instead, I can make a safe higher bid based on my hand. I have two 1s and two 7s. Bidding 3 1s is reasonable as I hold two myself, so only one more is needed in opponent's hand, which is likely. This raises the quantity and digit compared to the current bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand (38132924). To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 1, it's plausible that the total count of 1s is at least 3. However, bidding 3 2s or higher seems reasonable as it increases the digit. I'll bid 3 2s, as it's a valid higher bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 79811567, I have two 1s and zero 2s. The current bid is 3 2s, which I find unlikely since I hold none, implying the opponent would need at least three 2s in their hand. This is improbable. Alternatively, I can raise the bid on 1s, where I already have two. Bidding 3 3s or 3 4s is riskier as I have none of those digits. A safe and strategic move is to bid 3 5s, as I have one 5, making it plausible to reach three combined. This keeps the pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have the hand 38132924, which contains one 2 and no 5s. The bid history indicates that Player 1 increased the quantity and changed the digit from 2 to 5. Given that I have no 5s, it's possible that Player 1 has some 5s. However, the quantity is still relatively low. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or changing the digit. Since I have a 2 and there's already a bid of 3 2s, I can consider bidding 3 3s or higher. I will choose to bid 3 6s, increasing the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 79811567, I have one 6. Since the current bid is 3 6s, my single 6 suggests that there would need to be at least two 6s in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. This is plausible, so challenging now may be risky. To increase the bid, I can either bid 3 7s (same quantity, higher digit) or increase quantity. I have two 1s, so a safe and stronger bid is 4 1s, leveraging my hand strength.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. My hand is 38132924, which contains one 1. The total count of 1s across both players must be at least 4 for the bid to be valid. Given that I have one 1, my opponent must have at least 3 1s. While possible, it's a bit aggressive. However, I can bid higher. I have two 2s and the previous bids have touched on 2s and higher digits. I can increase the quantity or digit. Bidding 4 2s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit from 1 to 2 while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 79811567, I have two 1s, one 2, and one 6. The current bid is 4 2s. Since I only have one 2, for that bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least three 2s, which is somewhat unlikely. Alternatively, I can raise the bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have two 1s, so a bid of 4 6s is reasonable given that I also have one 6, and it is plausible the opponent has a few 6s as well. Bidding 4 6s is a safe incremental raise.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have the hand 38132924, which contains one 6. This means there are at least 2 sixes in total because Player 1 must have at least one 6 to make the bid somewhat reasonable. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have a 9 in my hand, and it's higher than 6, I can bid the same quantity (4) with a higher digit (9). Thus, bidding 4 9s is a valid and reasonable move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one 9. The current bid is 4 9s, which would require the opponent to have at least three 9s for the bid to be valid. Since each player only has 8 digits, having four or more 9s in total is unlikely without me holding more than one. Given the low probability that the opponent has three or more 9s, challenging is the best move.
