Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, which is a good starting point. Bidding 2 6s is a safe and reasonable opening bid, as it's based on the actual count in my hand and sets a baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, which makes it less likely that there are 2 or more 6s in total. However, it is still plausible that Player 0 has at least 2 6s in their hand, making a challenge too risky at this stage. To maintain the game and avoid a premature challenge, I will make a higher bid. I have two 0s in my hand, so bidding 3 0s is a reasonable and valid move, increasing the quantity while switching to a digit I have.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 0s. Since I have no 0s in my hand, it's unlikely that the total count of 0s is 3 or more. Therefore, I should challenge the current bid.
