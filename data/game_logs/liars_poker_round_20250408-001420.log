Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s and one 2 in my hand. The current bid is only 2 7s. Bidding 3 5s seems reasonable, increasing quantity based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. Bidding 3 6s is a higher digit than 5, and with my one 6, it's plausible that the total could meet or exceed the bid if the opponent has at least two more 6s. This seems like a reasonable move without overcommitting.

Player 0 bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains a 9 and a 2, which are higher digits than the current bid. I can safely increase the quantity while keeping the digit the same, as I'm not risking a higher digit without having it in my hand. Bidding 4 6s maintains a reasonable and defensible claim.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 1 bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have only one 6 in my hand, and the current bid is 4 6s. Without knowing Player 1's hand, it's uncertain if there are at least four 6s. Challenging is a safer option to test the validity of the bid without committing to a higher bid that might not hold.
