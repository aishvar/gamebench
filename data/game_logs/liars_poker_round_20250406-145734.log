Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. I'll start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s and two 7s. A bid of 2 7s seems reasonable as a starting point.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s. Since I only have one 7, it's risky to bid higher on 7s. However, I have two 8s, which makes bidding 3 8s a reasonable move, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand (05946109), I have zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, which requires at least three 8s across all 24 digits. Since I hold none, and statistically, the average count of any digit across 24 digits is about 2.4. Given that, and my zero count, the likelihood that the other two players collectively hold at least three 8s is low. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 1's (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bid of 3 8s.
