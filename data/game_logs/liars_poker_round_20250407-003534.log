--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 8s, one 0, one 9, one 4, and one 5. The most frequent digits are 2 and 8 with two occurrences each. A conservative but credible opening bid is 2 2s, reflecting my own hand's count and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 2s. Since I only have one 2, I cannot confidently bid higher without risking a challenge. However, I can increase the quantity to 3 2s, which is a reasonable bid given the possibility of the other player having at least one 2. This increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 2s (digits: 0, 9, 4, 5, 1, 8, 2, 2). Since I alone have three 2s, the current bid of 3 2s is certainly valid. Given that, it's risky to challenge now. The next minimal valid bid would be 3 3s or 4 0s (since 4 2s is higher in quantity and digit). Looking at my hand, I have one 0, zero 3s, and one 1, so bidding 4 0s or 4 1s seems speculative. However, bidding 3 3s is minimal and reasonable, as with 16 digits total, the chance of at least three 3s is plausible. Therefore, I will raise to 3 3s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 3s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have two 3s, increasing the quantity to 4 is not possible with just my hand. However, I can bid 3 of a higher digit. I have two 5s, so bidding 3 5s is reasonable, increasing the digit while maintaining the same quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 5. The current bid is 3 5s, which means there must be at least two 5s in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. Given that each player has only 8 digits, it's unlikely the opponent holds two or more 5s, especially since I have one. The probability favors challenging rather than making a higher bid on a digit I have little confidence in exceeding three. Therefore, I will challenge the current bid.
