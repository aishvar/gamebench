Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. My hand contains the digits 5, 2, 1, 9, 4, 1, 3, and 6. I have two 1s, which is the highest quantity of any single digit in my hand. Bidding 2 1s is a safe starting point, as it's likely that at least two 1s exist in total across both players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Bidding 3 1s would be a reasonable increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have two 0s, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 6, and one 8. Bidding 3 0s is also a valid bid. Since I only have one 1, bidding 3 1s is risky. I'll go with 3 0s as I have two 0s and it's a safe increase.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 0s. Since I only have one 0, it's unlikely that there are three 0s in total. However, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity to 4, but I don't have enough 0s to support this. Instead, I can bid on a higher digit that I have more of, such as 1s or 2s, but the current bid is on 0s. Given the limited information and my hand, challenging seems risky, but bidding 4 1s is a safer and higher bid than the current 3 0s, as I have two 1s and it increases both quantity and digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have zero 1s in my hand. Bidding 4 2s is a reasonable next step, as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This is a safer bid than increasing the quantity significantly, given my hand doesn't suggest many of any particular digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 2S'
Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand, and the current bid is 4 2s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total, it's unlikely there are 4 2s in play. I should challenge this bid as it seems too high based on the available digits.
