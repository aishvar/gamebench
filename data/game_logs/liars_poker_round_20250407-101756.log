Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 2, one 5, two 7s, two 8s, and one 9. A safe and strategic opening bid is to pick a digit I have multiple of, such as 7 or 8. I will start with '2 7s' because I hold two 7s, making it very likely there are at least two 7s in total.
