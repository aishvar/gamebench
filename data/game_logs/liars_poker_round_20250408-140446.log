Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first turn and no bids have been made yet. I have two 1s in my hand, which is a reasonable starting point for a bid. Starting with '2 1s' is a conservative and safe opening bid that reflects my hand while leaving room for escalation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 2 9s is a valid higher bid than 2 1s, as 9 is a higher digit. This bid is safe since my own hand already meets the quantity requirement.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 9s. This means there need to be at least one more 9 in Player 1's hand to meet the bid. While it's possible, I believe it's safer to increase the bid rather than challenge at this point. I also have two 1s in my hand, making it reasonable to bid 3 1s, as it increases the quantity and is based on my hand's strength.

Player 0 bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have three 6s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s increases the digit value while maintaining the same quantity, making it a valid higher bid. Since I already have three 6s, this bid is certain to be valid.

Player 1 bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, so the current bid of 3 6s relies entirely on Player 1's hand. This makes it plausible but uncertain. However, I do have three 1s in my hand, and since 1 is a lower digit, it is likely that Player 1 might also have at least one or two 1s, making a bid of 4 1s a safe and strategic increase in quantity while switching to a digit I have substantial evidence for.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 0 bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. Since I have 0 ones, the opponent must have at least 4. With only 8 digits in their hand, having 4 ones is possible but risky. I choose to challenge, as it's uncertain whether they have enough and I might win if they don't.
