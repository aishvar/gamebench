Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player to bid, I need to establish a starting point. My hand is 67506379. I have two 6s and two 7s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. There are 16 digits in total across both players. The expected frequency of any digit is 1.6. Bidding based on my strongest digits is a good strategy. I have two 6s. Bidding '3 Sixes' is a reasonably safe opening bid. It requires the opponent to have only one 6 among their 8 digits for the bid to be accurate, which is statistically probable (1 - (9/10)^8 â‰ˆ 57%). This bid utilizes the information from my hand effectively.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 sixes. Looking at my hand (91258344), I have zero sixes. Since I hold no sixes, for the bid to be valid, my opponent must have all 3 or more sixes in their hand, which is unlikely given the distribution of digits. Statistically, it's improbable for one player to hold 3 or more sixes out of 8 digits. Therefore, challenging the bid is the optimal move.
