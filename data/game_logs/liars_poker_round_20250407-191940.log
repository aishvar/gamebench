Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid, I should make a reasonable, but not overly aggressive bid. My hand contains two 3s. I'll bid 2 threes. This is a safe starting bid that doesn't reveal too much about my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s, meaning there are at least two 3s across both hands. Looking at my hand (57098211), I have zero 3s. Since I hold none, the entire bid depends on Player 0 holding both 3s, which is somewhat unlikely but plausible. Given that the bid is low (only 2), challenging is risky because it's quite possible Player 0 has two 3s. Instead, I can safely increase the bid by quantity or digit. I have two 1s, so I can confidently bid 2 1s, which is a valid higher bid (since digit 1 > 3 at same quantity). Alternatively, I can bid 3 of any digit I have multiple of. I have two 1s and one 0, 5, 7, 9, 8, 2, so safest is to bid 3 1s, assuming Player 0 might have at least one 1. This is a reasonable, safe incremental bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. My hand contains zero 1s. My opponent bid 3 1s after I bid 2 3s. It's highly unlikely they have three 1s given my hand. Bidding higher would be risky as I have no 1s and a challenge seems like the best option. I can't bid on 3s since I only have two of them and the bid must be higher than the previous bid. Bidding on any other number is also unlikely to succeed as it would require me to have a significant number of that digit.
