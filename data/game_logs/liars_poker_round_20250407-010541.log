Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (48350066), I have two 0s and two 6s, which are my strongest digits. Since this is the opening bid, I want to make a conservative but strategic bid. Starting with 3 6s is reasonable - I have two 6s myself, so only one more 6 needs to exist in the opponent's hand for this to be true. This gives me room to maneuver while putting pressure on my opponent.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (37741619). This means the opponent needs at least two 6s for the bid to be true, which is plausible out of their 8 digits. Challenging seems risky. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 3 7s, 3 8s, 3 9s, or 4 of any digit. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s only requires the opponent to have one 7, making it a relatively safe and believable bid based on my hand. It increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, putting pressure back on the opponent.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand. The opponent bid 3 7s, which means they would need to have at least 3 7s in their hand for this to be true. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely they would have exactly 3 7s. Given I have zero 7s and they would need all 3, I think challenging is safer than making a higher bid.
