Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have one each of the digits 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 in my hand, I should start with a conservative bid. A bid of 1 5s is a safe starting point, as it is based on my hand and leaves room for others to raise.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 5s. I have one 5 (from 45992862) in my hand, so it's plausible. However, I should bid higher to continue the game. I can see that I have two 9s, so bidding 2 9s is a reasonable next step as it increases both the quantity and the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding higher than 2 9s seems risky without knowing the other players' hands. I can bid 3 0s, 3 1s, 3 2s, 3 4s, 3 7s or 3 8s. Given I have a '7' in my hand, bidding 3 7s seems like a reasonable option to increase the quantity. Alternatively, I could challenge the 2 9s, but it's possible someone has multiple 9s. I'll choose to bid 3 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which means there needs to be at least two more 7s among the other two players' hands. Since the bid is relatively low and I have one 7, it's plausible that the other players have at least two more 7s combined. Therefore, I will make a higher bid by increasing the quantity to 4 7s.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I need to make a bid that is higher than this. I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand is 45992862, which contains one 7. Considering the total count of 7s across all players, it's plausible that there are at least four 7s. However, increasing the quantity to 5 or more might be too high given the distribution. Instead, I can keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit to 8 or 9. Since there's already a bid of 2 9s in the history, and I don't have a 9 in my hand, bidding 4 8s seems like a reasonable step as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

--- Turn: Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. It's unlikely there are three more 8s across the other two players' hands, but not impossible. However, increasing the quantity to 5 while keeping the digit at 8 is a reasonable bid, and I don't have a strong reason to believe the previous bid is a lie. Bidding 5 8s is a logical next step.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand. The current bid is 5 8s, which means the other two players would need to have at least five 8s combined. Given that there are only 16 other digits in play (8 per opponent), this seems unlikely. I should challenge the bid.
