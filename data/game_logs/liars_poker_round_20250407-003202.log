--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand. The current bid is 2 0s, which is likely based on Player 0's hand. Since I cannot increase the quantity of 0s, I should bid on a higher digit that I have multiple of, such as 7s. Bidding 3 7s is a reasonable increase, both in quantity and digit.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s and two 0s in my hand, but no 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, which seems unlikely since I don't have any 7s. I should challenge this bid as it seems too high given the total digits in play.
