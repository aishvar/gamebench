Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a mix of digits in my hand. Since the current bid is 'None', I can start with a reasonable bid. I see two 5s, one 4, one 6, one 8, and two 9s in my hand. I can bid on a digit that is likely to be present in others' hands as well. Considering the available digits, I'll bid on 5s, as it's a common digit and I have two of them in my hand. I'll increase the quantity to 3, which is a reasonable guess.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 5s. Therefore, the other player would need three or more 5s in their eight digits, which is statistically unlikely. I should challenge.
