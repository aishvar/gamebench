Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I need to make the first bid. I have one 0, one 1, two 2s, one 3, two 4s, one 8, and one 9 in my hand. A conservative approach is to bid 1 of a digit I have. I will bid 1 9s, as it's a relatively high digit and I have one in my hand. This avoids overcommitting early in the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 37073655, I have zero 9s. Since the current bid is only 1 9s, it's quite plausible that the opponent has at least one 9, making a challenge risky. To safely increase the bid, I should pick a digit I have multiple of. I have two 3s and two 7s, and two 5s. I can confidently bid 2 3s, 2 5s, or 2 7s, all of which are valid raises over 1 9s. Choosing 2 7s as it is a reasonable conservative increase based on my hand.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s would be risky without knowing the opponent's hand. I have one 8, so bidding 3 8s is a reasonable increase in digit while also increasing the quantity. This feels like a safer option than challenging immediately, as 2 7s isn't outrageously high.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 37073655, I have zero 8s. Since the current bid is 3 8s, and I hold none, for that bid to be valid, the opponent must have all three or more 8s, which is unlikely given the distribution of digits in 16 total cards. Statistically, three or more 8s concentrated entirely in the opponent's hand is improbable. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
