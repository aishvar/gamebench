Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I'm the first player to bid in this game. Looking at my hand (67705470), I have: two 7s, two 0s, one 6, one 5, one 4. Since I have two 7s in my hand, I know for certain there are at least 2 sevens in the game. This makes '2 7s' a safe opening bid that I know is true. I could bid higher, but a conservative opening gives me room to observe other players' bidding patterns before making more aggressive moves.

Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 8, 3, 0, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2. I see one 7 in my hand, so there are at least 2 7s in total if I consider my own digit. The current bid is low, and I have a 7 in my hand. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 7, bidding a higher quantity seems risky without more information. However, I can try to bid a higher digit with a reasonable quantity. The bid '3 8s' seems reasonable as it's higher in quantity than the current bid and I have two 8s in my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (04423368). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I see one 8, it's possible there are at least 3 8s in total. However, bidding more than 3 8s seems challenging because it requires at least 4 8s in total. I can bid 3 9s, which is a higher bid because 9 is greater than 8. This seems like a reasonable move given my hand and the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (67705470), I don't have any 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, which means Player 2 believes there are at least 3 nines across all players' hands. Since I have zero 9s, both Player 1 and Player 2 would need to have at least 3 9s between them. This is possible but not highly likely. I could challenge, but it's still early in the game, and 3 9s is a relatively low bid. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s and two 0s. I could bid 4 0s, but I'll go with 4 7s since it's a higher digit and I know I have two of them already.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I need to assess the likelihood of there being 4 or more 7s in total. Given that I have one 7 in my hand and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24, I should consider the probability of 7s being present in other players' hands as well. Since I have no information about other players' hands, I will assume they could have any digits. I have one 7 in my hand, so there could be 0-7 7s in total. The current bid seems plausible but I do not have enough information to safely assume there are 4 or more 7s. However, I do have a 7 in my hand and I could try to make a slightly higher bid considering my own digits.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (04423368). To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll base my decision on the likelihood of the current bid being true. The maximum possible 8s is 8 (one from each player's 8 digits). The current bid of 5 8s seems plausible, but I should consider the bids that led to this. The previous bid was 4 7s, and before that, it was 3 9s. The jump to 5 8s is significant. I have one 8, so at least one 8 exists. I'll increase the quantity to make a new bid, as increasing the digit to 9s might be too high given the previous bid was 3 9s. Bidding 6 8s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 8S'
Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 6 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 0 8s in my hand. The current bid is 6 8s, which means there need to be at least 6 8s among all players. Since I have none, all 6 would need to be in the other players' hands. Each player has 8 digits, so the other two players have 16 digits total. It's possible they could have 6 8s between them, but Player 1 initially bid 3 8s and then raised to 5 8s, which suggests they might have 3-4 8s. Player 2 raised to 6 8s, which could mean they have 2-3 8s. However, given that I have zero 8s and the bid is getting high, I think there's a good chance there aren't actually 6 8s total. I'll challenge this bid.
