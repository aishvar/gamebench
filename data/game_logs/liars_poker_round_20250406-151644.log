Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (70218736), I see I have two 7s. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but not too low. Bidding 2 7s seems like a good starting point as it reflects my hand and starts the bidding with a moderate claim.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7. The current bid is 2 7s, which means there must be at least one more 7 in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. This is plausible. Since I have one 7, making a higher bid of 3 7s is risky unless I have strong evidence, which I don't. Alternatively, increasing the digit at quantity 2 (e.g., 2 8s or higher) is unlikely to be safer without knowledge. Given that 2 7s is quite plausible but 3 7s is uncertain, it's better to pass the pressure back and challenge now rather than risk overbidding.
