Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there has been no bid yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits 8, 5, 4, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1. Counting occurrences: one 8, one 5, one 4, one 3, one 0, two 1s, and one 2. A safe opening bid would be on a digit I have multiple of, to increase the likelihood the total count is at least my bid. I have two 1s, so bidding 2 1s is a reasonable and conservative opening bid.
