Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening bid, I want to choose a reasonable starting point based on my hand. I have three 6s and two 5s, making 6 a strong candidate. A conservative but credible opening bid is 3 6s, reflecting my hand strength and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 37209834. I have zero 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, meaning the opponent claims there are at least three 6s total. For this to be true, the opponent must hold at least three 6s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, this seems somewhat unlikely for an opening bid, making a challenge tempting. However, I have two 3s in my hand. The expected number of any digit across all 16 cards is 1.6. Since I hold two 3s, it increases the likelihood of there being more 3s in total. Bidding '4 3s' is a valid higher bid (increasing quantity from 3 to 4). This bid requires at least two 3s in the opponent's hand, which aligns reasonably well with statistical expectation (total expected 3s is ~3.2) and leverages the strength of my hand (having two 3s). Bidding based on my hand seems strategically sounder than challenging the opponent's first bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 26515166, I have no 3s. The current bid is 4 3s, which requires at least four 3s across both hands. Since I have zero, all four must be in the opponent's hand, which is unlikely. Statistically, with 16 digits total, the expected count of any digit is around 1.6, so four 3s is a high bid. Given my zero count, it's reasonable to challenge.
