Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, it is very likely true given 16 digits total. Raising the bid is safe and strategic. I will increase the digit to 1 1s, a minimal raise, to gather more information without overcommitting.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 68423571, I have one '2', so the current bid of 1 2s is certainly valid. Since it's early in the game and the minimum bid is only 1 2s, I can safely increase the bid. I also have two '3's, making a bid of 2 3s quite safe and a natural progression, increasing both quantity and digit.
