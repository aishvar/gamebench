--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits 2, 0, 8, 7, 2, 3, 9, 6. I notice I have two 2s, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. A conservative but reasonable opening bid would be 2 2s, reflecting my hand's strength and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 5s. The current bid is 2 2s, and since I have no 2s, challenging is risky. Instead, bidding 2 5s is a safer move as I know I have two, making the bid valid regardless of the opponent's hand.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (20872396), I have zero 5s. Since the current bid is only 2 5s, and I have none, it's plausible my opponent has two or more 5s, so challenging now is risky. To maintain pressure and safely increase, I can bid 2 6s because I have two 6s in my hand, making that bid solid. This raises the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 6S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, so the current bid of 2 6s depends on Player 0 having at least one more 6. However, I have two 7s, which provides a solid foundation to make a higher bid on 7s, ensuring the bid's validity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 7S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s, which already matches the current bid of 2 7s. Since it's likely there could be additional 7s in Player 1's hand, challenging now would be risky. The minimum higher bid would be 2 8s, but I have one 8, making that plausible. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to 3 for any digit. I have two 2s and two 6s, so bidding 3 2s or 3 6s would be reasonable. Given these options, bidding 3 6s leverages my strong count of 6s and safely raises the bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s is a strategic move as it increases the digit from 6 to 7, making it a higher bid. This is based on the assumption that Player 0 might have at least one 7, making the total count at least three.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 20872396, I have two 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, which would require my opponent to have at least one 7 to be valid. Since I already hold two, it's quite plausible they have at least one more, making 3 7s a reasonable bid. To raise, I can either bid 3 8s or increase the quantity. I hold one 8, so bidding 3 8s is risky. Alternatively, I could bid 4 6s, but I only have one 6, so that seems less supported. However, I have two 2s, so bidding 4 2s is a reasonable increase in quantity supported by my hand. Therefore, the safest strategic move is to bid 4 2s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 2S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 2s in my hand, making the current bid of 4 2s questionable. Given the uncertainty and the risk of the bid being a bluff, challenging is the safer option.
