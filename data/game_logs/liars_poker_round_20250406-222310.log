Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make a valid initial bid. I have two 4s, two 6s, and one of each of 1, 2, 0, and 5 in my hand. A reasonable starting bid could be 2 4s, as I can confidently account for those in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I hold three 7s in my hand, which gives me solid backing for a bid on sevens. The current bid of 2 4s is low and not supported by my hand. By bidding 3 7s, I safely increase the quantity and leverage my strong count of 7s, ensuring that even if the opponent has no additional 7s, the bid is satisfied.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s and two 6s in my hand, but I have no 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, which seems high given that I have no 7s. I should challenge this bid as it is unlikely that there are 3 7s in total.
