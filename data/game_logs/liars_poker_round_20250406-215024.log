Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 2s, one 3, one 5, one 8, and one 9. A safe opening bid is typically 2 of a digit I have multiple of. I'll bid '2 2s' because I hold two 2s, making it statistically likely that there are at least two 2s in total.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s and two 0s in my hand, which means I can confidently bid on either digit. The current bid is 2 2s, which does not seem particularly strong given that I have more significant digits. I can bid 3 4s, which is a valid higher bid both in quantity and digit, as it increases the quantity and uses a digit I have in my hand.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 2s, one 4, and no indication that there are many 4s overall. The current bid is 3 4s, which requires at least two more 4s in Player 1's hand. Given that I only have one 4, it's somewhat unlikely Player 1 has two or more 4s. Since I have strong evidence for 2s (two in my hand), a reasonable higher bid would be 3 5s, as I also have one 5, and it's a minimal increase in digit with the same quantity. This keeps me in the game without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s and one 4 in my hand, but no 5s. The current bid is 3 5s, which seems high given that I have no 5s. With only 16 total digits, it's unlikely that there are 3 5s across both hands. I should challenge this bid.
