Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since there's no current bid, starting with a bid of 2 9s is reasonable and strategic, as it's based on my actual count and uses a high digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than this. I have a 2 in my hand, which could be useful, but I also need to consider the total possible count of digits. Since my hand is 84961262, I have one 9. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, bidding a quantity higher than 2 or a higher digit could be strategic. However, without knowing Player 0's exact hand, I must make an educated guess. I can see that bidding 3 0s seems reasonable as there are multiple 0s in my hand and it's a higher quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 0s. Challenging is a good move because if the total number of 0s is less than 3, I win. Given that I hold two 0s, the opponent would need at least one more for the bid to be valid. However, it's uncertain if they have any, making this a strategic challenge.
