Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 18048282. I count 2 eights and 2 twos and other digits appearing once or not at all. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and consider the total number of players and digits. Since there are 4 players and 8 digits each, there are 32 digits in total. Bidding 8 2s seems reasonable as it reflects a digit I have seen and is a relatively conservative bid considering the total count of digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 2s. I need to assess the likelihood of there being 8 or more 2s in total. Given that I have one 2 in my hand and there are 32 digits in play, I must consider if my bid could reasonably be higher. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should consider if there's a high likelihood of more 2s existing or if I can reasonably propose a higher quantity or digit. My hand contains one 2, and without knowing others' hands, I must make an educated guess. Bidding 9 3s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit and a slightly higher quantity, but I must ensure it's valid and strategic.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 9 3s

--- Turn: Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 7s, two 2s, one 4, one 5, one 6, and one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 9 3s, which is quite high. Since I don't have any 3s in my hand, it's unlikely that there are 9 3s across all players. I should challenge this bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) challenges Player 1's (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bid of 9 3s.
