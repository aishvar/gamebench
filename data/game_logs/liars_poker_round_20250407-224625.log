Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s and two 0s in my hand. Starting with a bid on 6s (a higher digit) is strategic, as it forces the opponent to bid a higher quantity or a higher digit. Bidding 2 6s is safe since even if the opponent has none, the total is exactly 2, making the bid valid if challenged.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s. Since I only have one, it's possible the opponent has at least one more to make the bid valid. However, given the low quantity, it's reasonable to challenge if I think the opponent might not have another 6. Alternatively, I could bid higher on a different digit where I have more confidence. I have two 3s and two 7s. Bidding 3 3s would be a safe increase based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s, requiring the opponent to have at least two 3s. Given the low probability of the opponent holding two or more 3s in their 8-digit hand (estimated ~21% chance based on expected distribution), challenging is statistically favorable. This outweighs the risk of bidding higher with uncertain outcomes like 3 6s or 4 0s.
