Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. Since it's the first bid, I'll start with a reasonable quantity. Bidding 2 0s is a safe and logical starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (37312618), I have zero 0s. Since the current bid is only 2 0s, it's quite plausible that the opponent has two or even more 0s in their hand of 8 digits. Challenging now would be risky. The minimal safe raise is to increase the digit while keeping quantity, so I can bid 2 1s. I have one 1, so the total number of 1s is at least one, and it's likely the opponent has at least one as well, making this a reasonable conservative bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have two 0s in my hand, which makes me think that the total number of 0s could be higher. Bidding 2 2s is a valid higher bid, as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 0 bids: 2 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 37312618, I have no 2s, so the likelihood of there being at least two 2s relies entirely on my opponent's hand. Since the current bid is only 2 2s, it's plausible they have both or some 2s. Challenging now would be risky. To safely increase the bid, I can look for digits I have multiple of. I have two 1s, two 3s, and two 1s again. Therefore, a safe and strategic higher bid would be 3 1s, raising the quantity by one and switching to a digit I hold two of.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 1s. Given that there are 16 total digits in play, it's possible that there are enough 1s to meet the bid. However, I also have two 0s, which could be a safer bet. I'll challenge the current bid to test its validity.
