Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It is the first bid of the game, and I have a balanced hand with one 0, one 3, one 5, one 2, one 9, one 4, one 1, and one 3. Given that no bids have been made yet, I will start with a conservative but reasonable bid of 2 3s, as I have two 3s in my hand, making it a safe opening move.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 4, 8, 7, 9, 0, 2, 1, and 8. I have two 8s and other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 2 3s, I should bid higher than 2, or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. I have one 8 and one 9, but no 3s. A reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity or the digit. I can see there's a possibility of having higher digits in my hand than 3, and I can try to increase the quantity or digit. A bid of 3 4s seems reasonable as I have a 4 and an 8 and a 9 which could potentially make the bid higher if my opponent has lower digits.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 4s. Based on my hand, it is plausible that there are at least three 4s across both hands. However, I cannot challenge the bid because it is not clearly unlikely. To stay in the game, I should make a higher bid. I also have two 3s, so bidding 4 3s is a reasonable step up in quantity while switching to a digit I have more of.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 4, 8, 7, 9, 0, 2, 1, and 8. I see that I have two 8s and one 3, but no 3s to contribute to the bid. Given that the current bid is 4 3s, I should consider if I can make a valid higher bid. A higher bid could be a higher quantity with the same or lower digit, or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since the current bid is 4 3s, I could bid 5 3s or change the digit to something higher. However, I should be cautious about overbidding since I do not know the distribution of digits among the players.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 4S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s, and I have two 4s in my hand. This means there need to be at least three more 4s in Player 1's hand to meet the bid. Given that it's plausible but uncertain, I can either challenge or make a higher bid. To avoid unnecessary risk and maintain control, I will bid 5 5s, as I have one 5 in my hand and increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same puts pressure on Player 1.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 5 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 4, 8, 7, 9, 0, 2, 1, and 8. The highest digit I have is 9 and the highest quantity I can reasonably bid on a digit I have is 3 (since I have three 8s but no 9s). The current bid is 5 5s, so I need to bid higher than 5. I can bid a higher quantity or a higher digit. Since I have three 8s, I can increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 6 8s seems reasonable as it's higher in quantity than the current bid and utilizes my hand's strength.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. In my hand, I have no 8s, which makes it unlikely that there are 6 or more 8s across both hands, as the total number of digits is only 16. Given the bid history, Player 1 has been steadily increasing the bids, but this jump to 6 8s seems overly ambitious. Since I have no 8s and the likelihood of Player 1 having all 6 or more 8s is very low, I should challenge the bid.
