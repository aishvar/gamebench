Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (74917348), I have one 7, one 4, one 9, one 1, one 3, one 8. Since this is the opening bid, I want to make a conservative bid based on what I know for certain. Starting with a digit I actually have makes sense. I have one 7, so bidding '2 7s' is reasonable - there's a good chance the opponent has at least one 7 as well, making this a safe opening bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have zero 7s in my hand (82150224). For the bid to be true, the opponent must have at least two 7s in their 8-digit hand, which has a probability of roughly 18.7%. While challenging is statistically favorable, the bid is very low. I have three 2s in my hand. Bidding based on my strongest digit seems safer and more strategic at this early stage. Bidding '3 2s' is higher than '2 7s' (higher quantity). This bid is true based on my hand alone (I have three 2s), making it a very safe bid and forcing the opponent to bid higher.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I can see all 8 of my digits (74917348) and I don't have any 2s in my hand. The opponent bid '3 2s', claiming there are at least 3 twos total. Since I have zero 2s, all 3 would need to be in their hand, which is possible but somewhat risky for them. I could challenge, but since it's early in the game and 3 is a modest quantity, they might actually have them. Instead, I'll make a conservative bid based on what I can see in my hand: I have one 3, one 4, and one 7. I'll bid '3 3s', which is valid as it uses the same quantity but a higher digit than their '3 2s'.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 82150224, containing three 2s. The current bid is 3 3s. I have zero 3s, meaning the opponent must have all three 3s for their bid to be true. While possible, it's not guaranteed. My previous bid was 3 2s, based on my strong holding of 2s. A safe and logical next step is to increase the bid based on my known strength. Bidding 4 2s requires only one 2 from the opponent's 8 digits to be true, which is statistically very likely (I already have 3). This leverages my hand's strength and puts pressure back on the opponent.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I can see all 8 of my digits (74917348) and there are no 2s in my hand. For the opponent's bid of '4 2s' to be true, they would need to have at least 4 twos in their hand since I have zero. While possible, this seems unlikely as it would mean half of their digits would need to be 2s. Given this and the fact that I have perfect information about my own hand containing zero 2s, challenging seems like the best move.
