Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there has been no bid yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, the digit '6' appears twice, which is the most frequent digit along with '2' (also twice). Opening with a conservative bid on a digit I have multiple of increases my chances of making a safe initial bid. I will choose to bid 2 sixes ('6') as it is a reasonable and defensible opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 6s'. To beat this bid, I need to bid a higher quantity of 6s or bid on a higher digit. Since I have no 6s in my hand, bidding on 6s is not an option. I have one 7, one 8, and one 0 in my hand. Bidding on 7s or 8s would be risky because the opponent might have multiple of these digits. However, bidding on 0s is a safer option since there is already one 0 in my hand and the opponent might not have any 0s. Therefore, I will bid '1 0' which is a valid higher bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 6s'. I have no 6s in my hand. It's unlikely that the other player has 2 6s. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
