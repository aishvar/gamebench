Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 2s, and one each of 6, 7, 4, and 3. A conservative but solid opening bid is 2 8s, reflecting my own hand and leaving room to maneuver.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand (my digits: 00065953). Bidding 3 0s is valid since my hand already has three 0s, ensuring the total count meets or exceeds 3. This bid increases the quantity from 2 to 3, making it a safer move than challenging or bidding a higher digit with uncertain counts.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 68742328, I have two 8s and no 0s. The current bid is 3 0s, which I cannot confidently challenge since it's plausible the opponent has three 0s. However, since I have two 8s, a strong move is to raise the bid to 3 8s, which is a higher digit at the same quantity, and quite likely given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. My hand has no 8s, so the total count is equal to the opponent's 8s. With only 8 digits in their hand, having three 8s is possible but less likely. Challenging could win if they have fewer than three 8s.
