Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand (69517590), the digit '9' appears twice, which is a relatively strong starting digit. Bidding '2 9s' is reasonable because, on average, the opponent is likely to have at least one '9' in their 8 digits, making a total of 3 or more quite plausible. This is a safe and strategic opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 6, 9, 5, 1, 7, 5, 9, 0. I have one '0' myself. The opponent has 8 digits, so for the current bid of 3 zeros to be true, there must be at least 2 zeros in their hand. Since zeros are less frequent digits, it's somewhat unlikely the opponent holds 2 or more zeros. Also, the opponent's last bid increased from my initial 2 9s to 3 0s, which might be a bluff to shift the digit. Given that I only have 1 zero, the bid of 3 zeros seems risky to accept. Therefore, challenging is statistically reasonable here.
