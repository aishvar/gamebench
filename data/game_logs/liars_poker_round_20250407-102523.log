Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s and two 5s. Opening with a conservative but solid bid based on my hand, I will bid 2 8s, reflecting the two 8s I hold.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 75058861, I have zero 9s, so the current bid of 2 9s relies entirely on the opponent's hand containing at least two 9s. Given that the opponent has 8 digits, it's unlikely they have two 9s, as the expected average is less than one 9 per hand. Therefore, the bid is probably an overstatement, making it a good opportunity to challenge.
