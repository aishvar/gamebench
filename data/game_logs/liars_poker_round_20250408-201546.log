Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, there are no 0s, so I have zero 0s. The current bid is only 1 0s, which is quite conservative and very likely true since there are 8 unknown digits in Player 0's hand, and it's probable that at least one 0 is present there. Challenging such a low bid is unwise. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the digit or the quantity. Since I have two 6s, bidding '2 6s' is a safe and reasonable increase over '1 0s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (1,3,5,6,9,2,4,6), I have no 7s, which makes the current bid of 2 7s plausible but not strongly supported from my side. Since there are 16 digits total and the naive opponent might be bluffing or simply bidding incrementally, a bid of 3 6s is statistically safer because I hold two 6s myself. It's reasonable to believe there could be at least one more 6 in the opponent's hand, making 3 6s a credible higher bid.
