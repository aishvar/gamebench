Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand 83129842, I notice that I have two 8s and two 2s, which are my most frequent digits. Opening with a conservative but solid bid based on my hand, I will start with 2 8s, reflecting my own count, which statistically suggests a reasonable minimum total count across both players.
