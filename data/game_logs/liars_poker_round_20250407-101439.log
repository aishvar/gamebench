Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. My hand contains one 1, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 7, one 8, one 3, and one additional 4. The most common digit in my hand is 4, appearing twice. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 4s, reflecting my hand and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 51486743, I have one 5. Since the current bid is 2 5s, it suggests there is likely at least one 5 in the opponent's hand. Bidding 3 5s is a natural incremental raise and plausible, as having a total of 3 fives across both hands is quite likely. Alternatively, I could raise on a digit where I hold more. I have two 4s, so bidding 3 4s is safer, as I personally hold two 4s, requiring only one more 4 from the opponent to satisfy the bid. Therefore, I'll bid 3 4s, which is a higher bid (same quantity but higher digit).

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 5 and one 4. The current bid is 3 5s, meaning there must be at least three 5s across both hands. Since I only have one 5, the opponent would need to hold at least two more 5s, which is possible but not guaranteed. Given that, challenging could be risky. Instead, a safe strategy is to increase the bid marginally. I can bid 3 6s since I have one 6, and it's a strictly higher bid with the same quantity but a higher digit. This keeps pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.
