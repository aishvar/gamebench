--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. I could bid 3 0s, which is a safe increase. However, since the opponent is Naive 50/50, they might be bluffing. Given the bid history, it's not unreasonable to think there might be at least three 7s, so I will bid 3 7s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. I could bid 4 0s, which is a safe increase. Alternatively, I could challenge, but I don't have enough information to be confident that there are fewer than three 8s. Given my hand, bidding 4 0s seems like a more reasonable move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. I can increase the bid to 5 0s, which is a valid higher bid. Bidding 5 1s seems risky, and I don't have enough information to challenge effectively.
