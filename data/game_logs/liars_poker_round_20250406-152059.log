Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (47820757), I count the occurrences of each digit: 0 appears once, 2 appears once, 4 appears once, 5 appears once, 7 appears three times. Since I have three 7s, a reasonable starting bid could be 3 7s or slightly higher. Bidding 4 7s seems like a safe and reasonable initial bid as it reflects a slight increase from the minimum count I know exists.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 7s, which reduces the likelihood that there are at least 4 sevens among both hands. Since I hold 8 digits and none are 7s, the entire count of 7s depends on my opponent's hand. For the current bid to be valid, the opponent would need to have all 4 (or more) 7s in their 8 digits, which is quite improbable. Therefore, it is statistically unlikely there are 4 or more 7s total, so challenging is the best move.
