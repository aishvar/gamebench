--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand (3, 8, 9, 5, 1, 0, 6, 6), I have two 6's, which is my highest count for a single digit. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid of 2 sixes is standard, as it's likely there are at least 2 or more sixes across both hands, given the total of 16 digits. This bid puts early pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (45028324), I have zero 6s. The current bid is 2 6s, which would require both 6s to be in Player 0's hand. Since the probability of Player 0 holding exactly two 6s among their 8 digits is low (roughly 10% chance per digit, so about 28% chance for two or more 6s), it is unlikely the total count is at least 2. Therefore, challenging is strategically sound here rather than risking increasing an improbable bid.
