Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I see one 0. The current bid is 1 0s, which is quite low. Since I have one 0 myself, it's very likely there is at least one more zero among the opponent's 8 digits, but even if not, the current bid is easily met. Therefore, I should comfortably raise the bid. A natural minimal raise is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, so bidding 1 1s. Alternatively, since I have two 1s, I can confidently bid 2 1s, increasing the quantity, which is a stronger move.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 45115086, I have no 2s, so the current bid of 2 2s depends entirely on the opponent having both 2s, which is possible but not guaranteed. Since 2 is a low bid and quite plausible, challenging now is risky. To maintain pressure and avoid a premature challenge, a safe and natural next bid is to increase the digit at the same quantity. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding 2 5s or 2 6s is less supported by my hand. However, I also have two 1s, which supports a higher quantity bid on 1s. Therefore, I will raise the quantity to 3 for digit 1, leveraging my strong count of 1s.
