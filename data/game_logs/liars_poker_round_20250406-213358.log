--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 4s. The current bid is only 2 4s, which is quite conservative given the total of 16 digits in play. Since it's very plausible that my opponent has at least two 4s or that there is one on their side, challenging now is risky. I also have two 5s and two 3s, so a safe higher bid is 2 5s, which is higher due to the digit. This incrementally raises the bid without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have no 5s in my hand, so if the total number of 5s is less than 2, challenging will win. Given the risk, challenging seems appropriate.
