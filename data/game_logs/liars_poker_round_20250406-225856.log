--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 2s. Since there are 16 total digits (8 per player), the opponent could have additional 2s. Bidding 2 2s is safe because even if the opponent has none, the total count (2) meets the bid. This creates a strong opening that's hard to challenge while leveraging my actual hand composition.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 31851020, I have two 0s, one 1, one 2, two 1s (correction: only one 1), one 3, one 5, and one 8. Specifically, I have one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 2 2s, so it's plausible Player 0 has at least one 2, making the bid reasonable. To overbid, I can increase the digit at the same quantity, so bidding 2 3s is a minimal raise. I have one 3, so it's plausible there are at least two 3s across both hands, making this a safe incremental bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 3s in my hand, so the opponent must have at least two 3s for their bid of '2 3s' to be valid. Given the low probability of them holding exactly two 3s in their 8-card hand (assuming uniform distribution), challenging is statistically favorable. Bidding higher would risk overcommitting to a digit with limited information.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) challenges Player 1's (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bid of 2 3s.
