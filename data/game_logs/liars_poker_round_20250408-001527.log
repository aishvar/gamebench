Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make an initial bid. My hand contains one 1, one 9, one 4, one 6, three 5s, and one 3. Given the distribution of my hand, I have the most 5s, so starting with a reasonable bid of 3 5s seems safe. This bid is low enough to test the waters and see how my opponent responds.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, so all 5s must be in Player 0's hand. The current bid is 3 5s, which means Player 0 must have at least three 5s. However, considering the total number of digits and the possibility of bluffing, it's uncertain if Player 0 actually has three 5s. Challenging the bid might be a good move to test if they are bluffing.
