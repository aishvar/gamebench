Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I will open with a conservative but reasonable bid. In my hand, I have two 3s, two 5s, and two 9s. Starting with a bid of 2 5s leverages my pair of 5s and sets a low but safe opening bid.
