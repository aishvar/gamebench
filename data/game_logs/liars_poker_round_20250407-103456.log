Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 4s, two 7s, one 8, and one 3. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 9s, reflecting my own hand, which also pressures the opponent without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 7, 8, 3, 9, 4, 4, 9, 2. I have zero 0s, so the current bid of 3 0s relies entirely on the opponent having at least 3 zeros. With 8 digits, it's unlikely the opponent has 3 or more zeros, as that's a high concentration (over a third of their hand). Therefore, the bid is probably an overstatement, and challenging it gives me a good chance to win.
