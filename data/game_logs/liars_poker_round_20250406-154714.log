Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 9.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 70317803, I have zero 9s. Since the total digits are 16 and I have none, the opponent would need to have all 3 or more 9s for their bid to be valid. This is unlikely, as 3 out of 8 is already a high concentration, and the probability of 3 or more 9s in their hand is low. Therefore, it's a good opportunity to challenge the bid.
