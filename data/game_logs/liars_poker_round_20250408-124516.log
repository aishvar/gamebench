Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains digits: 3, 1, 0, 2, 0, 5, 2, 8. Digit '0' and '2' each appear twice, making them the most frequent digits in my hand. Starting with a conservative bid is prudent since there is no prior information. I'll choose to bid on digit '2' since it's a middle digit and less suspicious than bidding zeros initially. A bid of 3 '2's seems reasonable, given I already have two of them myself.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than this. I have a 2 in my hand, so I can reasonably assume there are at least 3 2s in total if Player 0 has at least two 2s or if we both have at least one 2 and another digit. However, without knowing Player 0's hand, I will increase the quantity slightly and choose a higher digit to make my bid more credible. I have a 5 in my hand, so bidding 4 5s seems reasonable and higher than the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. My hand (31020528) contains exactly one digit '5'. Thus, for the bid of 4 5s to be valid, the opponent must have at least three '5's in their eight-digit hand. While it's possible, it's not highly probable. However, challenging at this point carries risk, as three '5's in their hand is not impossible. To avoid unnecessary risk, I prefer making a slightly higher but safer bid. My hand contains two '2's, making it more likely that at least four '2's exist between both hands. Therefore, bidding 4 6s or higher digits would be speculative without enough evidence. I will bid 4 6s cautiously, as it minimally raises the digit and keeps the bid plausible.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains 2 sixes, which already fulfills the current bid quantity of 4 sixes if we only consider my hand. However, I don't know Player 0's hand. Given that I have two 6s, bidding 5 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a higher digit if I think it's more likely to exist. My hand has one 8, and bidding on 1 8s or higher seems risky without more information. Since I have to make a strictly higher bid, I should consider increasing either the quantity or the digit. I have 3 8s and 2 6s and other digits that could potentially exist in Player 0's hand. A bid of 5 6s seems like a safe increase in quantity considering my own hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 31020528, containing digits: 3, 1, 0, 2, 0, 5, 2, and 8. I have no 6s. The current bid is 5 6s. Since I have zero 6s, Player 1 would need to have all five 6s themselves, which seems unlikely given the total of only 8 digits per player. Therefore, challenging this bid is the best action.
