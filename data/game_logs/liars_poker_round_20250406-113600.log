Player 1 response was not valid JSON after cleaning: 'To make a decision, let's analyze the given information:

1. **Your Hand**: 55155882
   - Analyzing your hand: You have 2 '5's.

2. **Current Bid**: 1 5s
   - The current bid is on '5's with a quantity of 1.

3. **Your Turn**: It's your turn as Player 1.

Given that the current bid is '1 5s', to make a higher bid, you need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit.

Since you have 2 '5's in your hand, you know that the total count of '5's across all players is at least 2 (the 2 '5's you have) plus at least the one '5' that the current bid is claiming exists elsewhere. So, the total count of '5's is likely more than 1.

Let's consider the options:
- You can bid higher than '1 5s' by either bidding a higher quantity of '5's or keeping the quantity as 1 and bidding a higher digit.

1. **Bidding a higher quantity of '5's**: Since you have 2 '5's and the bid is for at least 1 '5', you can reasonably assume there's more than 1 '5'. You can bid '3 5s' because you know there's at least 2 '5's in your hand and the bid is for 1 '5'. So, bidding '3 5s' is a reasonable increase.

2. **Bidding a higher digit with the same quantity**: You could bid '1 6s', but without information about the distribution of '6's, this is speculative.

Let's examine both options:
- **Bidding '3 5s'**: This is a relatively safe bid because it's based on the knowledge that there are at least 3 '5's (2 in your hand and at least 1 as per the current bid).

- **Bidding '1 6s'**: Your hand has no '6's. This bid is speculative and assumes that at least one other player has a '6'.

Given the information and the need to make a bid that's higher than '1 5s', the most reasonable action is to increase the quantity of '5's because it's based on the information you have (your hand and the current bid).

Therefore, bidding '3 5s' seems like a reasonable action. It increases the quantity, making it a valid higher bid than '1 5s'.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. There are 32 total digits in play (4 players * 8 digits). The expected number of any digit is 3.2 (32/10). A bid of 2 5s is therefore very likely to be true, making a challenge risky. I have one 5 in my hand (48413175). To make a higher bid, I can increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. I have two 1s and two 4s in my hand. Bidding based on digits I hold strongly is a good strategy. Bidding '3 1s' is higher than '2 5s' (quantity increases from 2 to 3). Since I hold two 1s, this bid only requires one more 1 among the remaining 24 digits held by other players. This is statistically very likely (expected total 1s is 3.2), making it a safe and informative bid based on my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have a 1 in my hand, and given that there are 4 players with 8 secret digits each, the total possible count of any digit is 32. The bid of 3 1s seems plausible but not extremely high. I have two 1s in my hand, and if I assume the other players might have at least one 1, bidding 4 1s seems reasonable. However, I should consider if there's a better chance of making a higher bid with a different digit. Since my hand is 13742191, I have one 1, one 3, one 4, one 7, one 9, and no other 1s. I could try to increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding a higher quantity of a higher digit than 1 seems risky without more information, but I can see if I can make a safe bet by increasing the quantity slightly or the digit. Given my hand, bidding 4 1s would be a straightforward increase in quantity.

Player 1 response was not valid JSON after cleaning: 'To determine the best course of action, let's first analyze the given information:

1. **Your Hand:** 55155882
   - Counting the digits in your hand: 
     - 5 appears 4 times
     - 1 appears 0 times
     - 8 appears 3 times
     - 2 appears 1 time

2. **Current Bid:** 5 5s
   - The bid is on the count of 5s, with a quantity of 5.

3. **Your Turn:** It's your turn as Player 1.

Given the current bid is 5 5s, to make a higher bid, you need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit.

Let's analyze your hand:
- You have 4 fives, so the total count of 5s across all players is at least 4. The current bid is 5 5s, which means there must be at least one more 5 among the other players' hands.

To make a higher bid than 5 5s, you could either bid a higher quantity with the same digit (e.g., 6 5s) or bid the same quantity with a higher digit (e.g., 5 6s).

1. **Bidding Higher Quantity with the Same Digit (5s):**
   - Bidding 6 5s implies there are at least 6 fives in total. Given you have 4 fives, there need to be at least 2 more fives among the other players. This is plausible but depends on the distribution.

2. **Bidding Same Quantity with a Higher Digit:**
   - You have 3 eights in your hand. The next higher digit than 5 is 6, but you don't have any 6s. The next higher digit is 8. Bidding 5 8s means you're asserting there are at least 5 eights in total.

Let's evaluate the options:
- **Bidding 6 5s:** This requires that there are at least 2 more 5s among the other players. It's a reasonable assertion given that Player 0 (who made the current bid) likely has at least one 5.
- **Bidding 5 8s:** Given you have 3 eights, this bid implies there are at least 2 more eights among the other players. This is also a plausible scenario.

Both options seem viable, but let's directly compare them:
- **6 5s** is a more conservative bid as it sticks with the same digit and only increases the quantity by 1. It's a relatively safe bid given the context that the previous player bid 5 5s and likely has some 5s.
- **5 8s** changes the digit to 8 and keeps the quantity the same. Given you have 3 eights, it's a reasonable assertion that there could be 2 more eights among the other players.

Given these considerations, bidding **6 5s** seems like a cautious and reasonable step as it directly builds upon the existing bid without changing the digit. It implies a slight increase in the total count of 5s, which is plausible.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (48413175). This means the other 3 players need to have at least 4 more 8s among their 24 digits for the bid to be true. The expected number of 8s across all 32 digits is 3.2, and in the remaining 24 digits, it's 2.4. Requiring 4 more 8s is above average, making a challenge plausible. However, it's not an extremely high bid yet. 

Alternatively, I can bid higher. A higher bid would be 5 9s or 6+ of any digit. 
- Bidding 5 9s is risky as I have no 9s.
- Bidding 6 of a digit seems better. I have two 1s. Player 3 previously bid 4 1s, suggesting there might be a reasonable number of 1s in play. Bidding 6 1s requires 4 more 1s among the other 24 digits (expected 2.4). Given my hand and Player 3's previous bid, this seems like a reasonably safe and informative bid. It leverages my hand strength in 1s and the history. Bidding 6 4s (I have two 4s) is another option, but lacks the supporting bid history that 1s have. Bidding 6 8s seems counterintuitive as I only have one 8 and would be raising a bid that already seems slightly high.

Comparing challenging 5 8s vs. bidding 6 1s: Bidding 6 1s feels like a stronger move. It uses information from my hand and the game history, puts pressure on the next player (Player 3, who previously bid on 1s), and avoids potentially challenging a bid that might just be true.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that this bid is false. My hand contains one 1, so I know there are at least 4 1s in total (since Player 3 previously bid 4 1s). To make a valid higher bid, I must increase either the quantity or the digit. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32, and given that 6 1s seems plausible but not extremely high, I should consider my own hand and the hands of others. My hand has one 1, and I could reasonably assume others might have a few 1s as well, but I also have a 5 which could potentially be used to make a higher bid. However, bidding 7 1s seems too risky without more information on other players' hands. A safer and higher bid could involve a different digit. I have one 5 and one 9, and lower digits might be more common. I will increase the quantity and digit slightly, considering my own digits and the possibility that others might have a few 5s.

However, challenging now risks revealing my hand and potentially losing if there *are* 7 or more 5s. I can bid 8 5s to put pressure on the other players, or I can bid on a different digit. I have two 9s, so bidding 2 9s is a safe, valid bid. Alternatively, I have one 0, and it's unlikely anyone would bid high on 0s. However, the previous bids suggest players are focusing on 5s and 1s. Therefore, increasing the quantity of 5s is the most logical play. Bidding 8 5s is a reasonable bluff, as it's only one higher. I'll go with that.

2. **Current Bid**: 8 5s by Player 0.
3. **Bid History**: The bidding has been quite aggressive, with a focus on both 5s and 1s at different points.

Given that the current bid is 8 5s, to make a higher bid, you need to either bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit.

Let's analyze your hand and the current bid:
- You have 5 fives in your hand. The total number of fives across all players is at least 8 (as per the current bid), and since you have 5 of them, the remaining 3 players must have at least 3 fives among them.
- The current bid of 8 5s seems plausible because you have a significant number of 5s, and it's possible the other players have the remaining 3.

To make a higher bid than 8 5s, you could either bid a higher quantity (e.g., 9 Xs) or the same quantity with a higher digit (e.g., 8 6s or higher).

Let's consider your options:
1. **Bidding a Higher Quantity**: You could bid 9 5s. Given that you have 5 fives, the other 3 players need to have at least 4 more fives among them, which is possible but seems a bit aggressive given the distribution so far.
   
2. **Bidding the Same Quantity with a Higher Digit**: The next higher digit than 5 is 6, but you don't have any 6s. You could bid 8 8s. You have 2 eights, so the other players would need to have 6 eights among them. This is a significant number but not impossible.

Let's evaluate the likelihood and potential outcomes:
- Bidding 9 5s: This requires the other players to have at least 4 fives, which is plausible given the history (Player 0 bid 8 5s, and previously, there were bids on 5s).
- Bidding 8 8s: This seems like a reasonable bid because you have 2 eights, and it's possible the other players have a substantial number of eights.

Given these considerations, bidding 8 8s seems like a reasonable action because:

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand (48413175). For the bid to be true, there must be at least eight 6s distributed among the other three players' 24 digits. The expected average number of any digit across all 32 cards is 3.2. Requiring 8 out of the remaining 24 cards (a rate of 1/3) is significantly higher than the average (1/10) and seems unlikely, especially since I hold none. Player 1 previously bid 5 8s and then switched to 8 6s immediately after Player 0 bid 8 5s. This switch, rather than challenging or raising the 5s bid, could indicate a bluff or weakness regarding 6s. Given my lack of 6s, challenging seems statistically favorable.
