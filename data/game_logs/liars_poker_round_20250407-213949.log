--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand '05977312', the digit '7' appears twice, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. A safe opening bid typically reflects the count of the most common digit in your own hand, assuming the opponent has at least one more. Therefore, I will start with a conservative but reasonable opening bid of 3 sevens (digit 7), expecting that between both hands there are at least 3 sevens.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid of 3 7s is relatively low, and I have a good chance of making a higher bid without being challenged. I notice that I have two 7s in my hand, which is the same digit as the current bid. I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity or changing the digit. Since I have a 7 in my hand, I can try to make a higher bid by increasing the quantity.
