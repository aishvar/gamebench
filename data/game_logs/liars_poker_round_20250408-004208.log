Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to establish a bid. My hand has two 8s. Bidding 3 8s assumes the opponent has at least one 8, which is plausible given their 8 hidden digits. Starting with a high digit (8) and a modest quantity (3) creates a balanced challenge for the opponent.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 8s. Considering the opponent might be bluffing, challenging is a strategic move to test if there are indeed three 8s. The risk is moderate, and if successful, it ends the game in my favor.
