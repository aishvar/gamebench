Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid in the game. Looking at my hand (84832129), I have: one 1, one 2, two 3s, one 4, one 8, one 9, and no 0s, 5s, 6s, or 7s. Since I have two 3s in my hand, this is my most frequent digit. The other player likely has some 3s as well. A conservative first bid would be '3 3s', suggesting there are at least 3 threes between both our hands. This is reasonable since I already have 2 threes myself, so I only need the opponent to have 1 more for this to be true.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. I could bid higher, but it's early in the game, and I don't have a strong read on the total number of 3s. Since the bid is still relatively low, I will bid slightly higher to gather more information. I'll bid 4 4s, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge. Looking at my hand (84832129), I don't have any 4s. The current bid claims there are at least 4 4s in total between both hands. Since I have 0 4s, that would mean the opponent needs to have at least 4 4s in their hand of 8 digits. While possible, having 4 of the same digit in 8 random digits is somewhat unlikely (but not extremely so). I could challenge, but I'll take a more conservative approach and make a higher bid. I have one 8 in my hand, so I'll bid 5 8s, which is higher than 4 4s in both quantity and digit value.

Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. It's possible the opponent is bluffing, but it's also possible they have multiple 8s. Since I don't have strong information to suggest the bid is false, and there are 16 total digits in play, I will conservatively increase the bid. I will bid 6 0s, since I have a 0 and it's a safe increase.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (84832129), I have no 0s. The current bid is 6 0s, which means Player 1 is claiming there are at least 6 zeros between our hands. Since I have 0 zeros, all 6 would need to be in Player 1's hand. While possible, this seems unlikely as it would mean 75% of their hand is zeros. I could bid higher, but I don't have strong evidence for any particular digit. For example, I have two 8s, but bidding 7 8s would require Player 1 to have at least five 8s, which is also unlikely. Given the high quantity of zeros claimed and the fact I have none, challenging seems like the best option.
