Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid of the game, I must open with a reasonable starting bid. Looking at my hand 92130226, the most frequent digits are 2 (three times) and 2 is a common digit overall. A conservative yet solid opening bid would be 3 of the digit 2, as I hold three 2s myself, and it's likely there is at least one more in the opponent's hand, making this a safe starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I need to analyze my hand to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. My hand is 10714398. I count the occurrences of '2' in my hand, which is 1. The total count of '2's across both hands must be at least 1 (mine) plus some from Player 0's hand. The bid of 3 2s is plausible because Player 0 could have up to 2 '2's in their hand, making the total count 3. To exceed this bid, I need to bid on a higher quantity or a higher digit. I can bid on a quantity of 3 or more with a different digit, or bid on '2' with a quantity of 4 or more. I have a total of 3 '1's in my hand. If I assume Player 0 has at least one '1', the total count of '1's could be 4, making a bid of 4 '1's reasonable. I will bid 4 '1's as it's a higher bid than 3 '2's.

Player 1 bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 ones. Looking at my hand (92130226), I have zero 1s, which is unfavorable for supporting the bid. Since I hold no 1s, the opponent would need to have all 4 or more 1s in their hand for the bid to be valid. The probability of one player holding 4 or more 1s in an 8-digit hand is quite low. Therefore, it is statistically unlikely that there are at least 4 ones across both hands. Challenging the bid is the optimal move here.
