Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Examining my hand '27511397', I see the counts: 1 (two times), 2, 3, 5, 7 (two times), 9. The digit '1' appears twice, which is relatively high in my hand. Statistically, across both hands (16 digits total), it's reasonable to expect at least 3 of any digit. Therefore, a conservative yet safe opening bid is 3 ones.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 ones. I have one '1' in my hand. To make a valid bid, I need to bid higher than 3 ones. I can bid 4 ones, or I can bid 3 of a higher number. I will bid 4 ones, as it is a simple and safe increase.

--- Turn: Player 0 (quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains only one '1' (digit sequence: 27511397). The current bid is 4 '1's across both hands. Since I have just one '1', for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least three '1's. Given the average distribution of digits in 8 random digits, having three or more '1's is unlikely but not impossible. However, it's statistically improbable that the opponent has three or more '1's, making the total at least four. Therefore, challenging is the strategically sound move here.
