Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first move and there is no current bid, I should open with a safe, reasonable bid. Looking at my hand 96481380, the digit '8' appears twice, which is quite strong. It's likely that there is at least one more '8' in the opponent's hand, so bidding 2 eights is conservative but reasonable. Alternatively, starting with a quantity of 2 on a common digit like '1' or '0' is also standard, but given my double '8's, bidding on '8' gives me better control.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. Since I have 0 eights, challenging could win if Player 0 has â‰¤1. However, bidding 2 9s is safer: I have 1 nine, and if Player 0 has at least 1, the bid holds. Bidding on a higher digit (9 > 8) forces Player 0 to either challenge or raise the quantity, leveraging my existing nine.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains one '9'. The current bid is 2 nines, so for that to be valid, the opponent must have at least one nine. Since each player holds 8 digits, it's plausible the opponent has one or even two nines, but not guaranteed. Given the opponent confidently raised from 2 eights to 2 nines, they likely have at least one nine. Challenging now risks losing if they do. A safe strategic play is to raise to 3 eights, since I have two eights in my hand, making a total of at least two, and I only need one more from the opponent to plausibly reach three. This is a reasonable incremental bid that pressures the opponent while remaining credible.

Player 0 bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. Your hand has no 8s, so the opponent must have at least 3 to make the bid valid. Given the bid history, Player 0 raised from 2 8s to 3 8s after your bid of 2 9s. However, statistically, having 3+ 8s in an 8-digit hand is unlikely (only ~3.5% chance). Challenging is favorable as you have zero 8s, and the opponent likely doesn't have enough to meet the bid.
