Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 7s, two 0s, one 1, and one 6. A safe opening bid is usually 2 of a digit I hold multiple of. Given I have two 9s, bidding 2 9s is a reasonable and conservative opening bid.
