Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid and I have the digits 90410843, I can analyze my hand to make an initial bid. My hand contains two 0s, one 9, one 1, two 8s, and two 4s (0, 9, 1, 8, 4 are the digits present). A reasonable starting bid should be based on the distribution of digits in my hand. I have a total of 8 digits, with the most frequent being 8 and 4 (two occurrences each). A bid of '2 8s' seems like a conservative and reasonable starting point because it reflects a digit I have, and it's a low quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one '8'. The current bid is 2 '8's, meaning the opponent is claiming there is at least one more '8' among their 8 unknown digits. Given that each digit (0-9) has a roughly equal chance of appearing, it is plausible that the opponent could have at least one '8'. Therefore, challenging now would be risky. Instead, I will make a safe incremental bid. I have two '5's in my hand, making a total of at least two '5's already present. I can confidently increase the bid to '2 9s' or '3 5s'. Since I already have two '5's, bidding '3 5s' is slightly riskier without knowledge of the opponent's hand. However, bidding '2 9s' would not increase the quantity, only the digit. Considering the game dynamics, increasing the digit at the same quantity is the safest move. Thus, I will bid '2 9s'.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. My hand is 90410843, which contains one 9. So, in total, there are at least two 9s. The bid of 2 9s is plausible and not overly aggressive. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have information about my own hand, I see that I have a total of 3 digits that are 4 or higher (including the 9). Bidding 3 4s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand (25078557) contains no 4s. The opponent bid 3 4s, meaning they likely have some 4s. However, since I have none, the probability of there being at least three 4s in total is uncertain but plausible. Challenging now would be risky because the opponent might easily have three or more 4s themselves. Instead, I should make a cautious higher bid based on digits I possess. I have three 5s, making a bid of '3 5s' invalid since the current bid is already '3 4s'. Therefore, I'll safely bid '4 5s', assuming at least one additional 5 from the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. My hand is 90410843, which contains one 5. So, at least one 5 is in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 would be a reasonable step if I think there's a good chance the other player has at least one more 5. However, I can also consider bidding the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I have information about my own hand, I see that I have a 9 and an 8, which were previously bid upon. Bidding 4 6s is a safer increase in digit without committing to a higher quantity, and it's a reasonable guess that there might be at least one 6 in the other player's hand or my own, making the total count plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 25078557, which contains digits 2, 5, 0, 7, 8, 5, 5, and 7. I have no digit 6 at all. The opponent has bid 4 6s, meaning they must have multiple 6s themselves. However, I have no 6s, and since there are only 16 digits total (8 per player), the opponent would need at least four 6s in their hand alone. Given the limited information and the high risk involved, it's unlikely they hold four or more 6s. Thus, challenging this bid is the safest and most logical action.
