Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 80647358. I have two 8s, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. The total number of digits in play is 16 (2 players * 8 digits). The expected average count for any digit is 1.6. Since I already have two 8s, bidding '3 8s' is a reasonable opening. It assumes the opponent has at least one 8, which is statistically likely. This bid leverages my hand's strength in 8s and sets a non-trivial starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. In my hand, I have no 8s, which makes it less likely that there are at least 3 8s across both hands. Since the total maximum digits across both hands is 16, and I see none, the probability of the opponent having 3 or more 8s is low. Therefore, I should challenge this bid.
