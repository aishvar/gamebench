Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 2, 3, 4, 7, 6, and 1 in my hand. The current bid is None. I should start by bidding on a digit that I'm sure is in my hand. The digit 7 is in my hand, and it's a relatively rare digit, so I'll start by bidding on that.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 1 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, which already meets the current bid of 1 7s even without knowing the opponent's hand. Since the total number of digits is 16, it's quite likely there are more than one 7 overall. The safest and minimal valid raise is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity at 1, so I will bid 1 8s, which is a strictly higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 1 8S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 1 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is only 1 8s. Bidding 2 8s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 8S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, which is plausible given my hand alone, so challenging now would be risky. To make a higher valid bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since 9 is the only digit higher than 8, and I have one 9, a safe incremental bid is 2 9s, which slightly increases the digit while maintaining the quantity. This keeps pressure on my opponent without overcommitting.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 9S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have a 9 in my hand. I can safely increase the quantity to 3 9s, as it's a valid and reasonable bid based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, so for that bid to be valid, my opponent would need to have at least one 9. This is plausible but not guaranteed. Bidding 4 9s would require my opponent to have at least two 9s, which is unlikely given I already hold two. Alternatively, I can raise to 3 0s through 3 9s, but all of those would be lateral or invalid bids except increasing quantity or digit. The safer strategic move is to challenge the bid of 3 9s, as it's borderline and could be a bluff.
