Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand 99045604, I count two 9s, two 0s, two 4s, one 5, one 6. The best opening bid typically targets a digit I have multiple of, maximizing initial credibility. I have two 9s and two 0s, so starting with a bid of 2 for either digit is reasonable. 9s are generally safer as players often start with high digits. Therefore, I will open with a bid of 2 nines.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of '23153101', I have zero 9s. Since there are only 16 total digits between both players (8 each), and I can see my own hand contains no 9s, the opponent would need to have at least 2 nines in their hand for their bid to be valid. While possible, I could make a higher bid. However, since I have two 1s in my hand, bidding '3 1s' would be a safer play as I know for certain about my own 1s and only need one more from the opponent's hand to make it valid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 ones. Looking at my hand (99045604), I have zero '1's. Since I hold none, the entire count of '1's depends on Player 1's hand. For there to be 3 or more '1's in total, Player 1 would need to have all 3 or more, which is unlikely given a random 8-digit distribution (expectation is less than 1). Thus, the bid of 3 '1's is probably an overstatement, making challenging the best strategic choice.
