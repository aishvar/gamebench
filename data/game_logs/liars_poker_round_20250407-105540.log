Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is None. Bidding 2 9s seems reasonable, as I have a decent chance of winning with this bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider my hand and the possibility of having a higher quantity or digit. My hand contains the digits 0, 3, 0, 1, 9, 5, 7, 2. I have one 9, so I can confidently say there are at least 2 9s in total (including Player 0's hand). However, I don't want to just match the quantity; I want to make a higher bid. I can see that bidding 3 0s would be a reasonable increase in quantity with a lower digit, but I should check if I can increase the digit instead. The highest digit I have is 9, and I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I will increase the digit and bid 3 5s, as 5 is a higher digit than 0, 1, 2, 3, or 7, and I have a 5 and a 7, making it plausible that there are at least 3 of some digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have two 5s in my hand. I should bid a higher quantity or digit to increase my chances of winning. Given that I have two 9s in my hand, I can bid a higher quantity and digit, making 4 9s a reasonable bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 0, 3, 1, 9, 5, 7, 2, and 8, and 6, 6, 4 are not present but irrelevant. I see I have one 9, but not enough to confidently increase the quantity of 9s. However, I can see there's a possibility that there are not many 9s in total because Player 0 only had 2 9s initially. I have a 5 and a 9 in my hand, so bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. Since I have one 9 and the bid is 4 9s, I should consider if I can safely bid higher. I have one 9, so if I bid 5 9s, it seems unlikely but I could be wrong. A safer bet would be to increase the digit and/or quantity cautiously. I notice I have two 5s and the last bid was 3 5s. I could try to increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 5 5s seems like a reasonable increase in quantity and uses a digit I have in abundance.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand. The current bid is only 5 5s. Bidding 6 9s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 0, 3, 1, 9, 5, 7, 2, and 8, 4, and 6 is not present but  I see one 9 and one 5. The bid history shows that there are at least 6 nines in total. I should consider if there's a possibility that there are more than 6 nines, or make a bid that seems reasonable based on my hand and the bid history. I have one 9 and can see if I can make a reasonable bid or challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid of 7 0s seems low given the increasing bids. I have 2 0s in my hand, so I can confidently increase the quantity to 8 0s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 8 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 0s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that this bid is valid. My hand contains the digits 0, 3, 1, 9, 5, 7, 2, and 8. I have one 0, which means there are at least 9 zeros in total if Player 0 has 8 zeros as claimed. Given that I have to make a higher bid, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 0, I should focus on a different digit. I have one 5 and two other digits that could potentially be high. However, without exact information on Player 0's hand, I must make an educated guess. I see an opportunity to bid higher on a digit that I have in my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 9 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 5s. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 10 9s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 10 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 9s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and there are 8 digits in each player's hand, I need to assess the likelihood of there being 10 or more 9s in total. Since the bid history shows multiple bids on 9s and 5s, but not on other digits specifically, and given that I do not have any 9s in my hand, I should consider the possibility of challenging or making an informed bid. However, my hand contains 3 5s and 2 7s, but no 9s or digits close to 10. The last few bids have been quite high, so I should consider if there's a likely digit that could be overbid or if challenging is more suitable.
