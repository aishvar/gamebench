Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid. My hand contains the digits 8, 0, 9, 4, 1, 2, 4, and 7. I see that I have two 4s, which is a significant number of a single digit. I will start with a conservative bid that could be reasonable given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 4s. It is plausible that Player 0 has at least one 4 in their hand, making the bid reasonable. To avoid challenging too early and risking a loss, I will make a higher bid. I also have two 3s in my hand, so I will bid 3 3s, increasing the quantity and changing the digit to something I have more confidence in.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 8, 0, 9, 4, 1, 2, 4, and 7. I have two 4s, which could be useful. The bid must be higher in quantity or digit. Since I have two 4s, bidding 4 4s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to 3 3s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 4S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have one 4 in my hand, so for the bid to be valid, there must be at least three more 4s in Player 0's hand. This is plausible but not guaranteed. To avoid an early challenge and to maintain a stronger position, I will raise the bid to 4 6s, as I have two 6s in my hand, making it more likely that the bid is achievable across both hands.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid is incorrect. My hand contains the digits 8, 0, 9, 4, 1, 2, 4, and 7. I have two 4s, which could be useful. The last bid was 4 6s, so I need to bid higher than 4 6s. I can bid a higher quantity or a higher digit with the same or higher quantity. Since my hand has two 4s and the current bid is 4 6s, I can try to bid 5 4s or higher, or match the quantity and bid a higher digit. Given that I have two 4s, bidding 5 4s seems reasonable as it's higher than 4 6s and I have the digits to support a higher quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 4S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s, and I have one 4 in my hand. Based on my hand and the bidding history, Player 0 seems to be focusing on 4s, which might indicate they have several 4s in their hand. However, I find it plausible that there are at least five 4s across both hands, given the total of 16 digits and Player 0's confidence in raising the bid multiple times. To maintain the pressure, I will increase the bid to 5 6s, as I have two 6s in my hand, making it a reasonable continuation.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or challenge. My hand is 80941247. I have one 6, which could potentially make the bid 6 6s if I know Player 1 has enough 6s to make it 5 or more. However, I also see that bidding 6 7s or higher would be a strong move as it increases both quantity and digit. But first, I need to verify if there's a possibility of challenging the bid or if I can safely make a higher bid based on my hand and the history.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 6 6s. For there to be at least six 6s across both hands, the other player would need to have at least four 6s. Given the distribution of digits in my hand and the bidding history, it seems plausible that Player 0 might have a few 6s, but four is unlikely given their earlier bids focused on 4s. Therefore, I believe the current bid is exaggerated, and challenging it is the best move.
