Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I have the opportunity to start the bidding. My hand contains the digits 5, 6, 4, 3, 6, 7, 4, and 9. I can confidently bid on the digit that appears most frequently in my hand, which is 6 (it appears twice). Therefore, I will make a bid of '2 sixes'. This is a reasonable starting point, as I have a strong hand and it sets the stage for the game.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have no 7s in my hand (56436749), and since the maximum count of 7s possible from both players is 2, the bid is not likely to be valid. Therefore, I will challenge the last bid.
