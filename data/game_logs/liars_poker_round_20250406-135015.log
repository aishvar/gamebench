Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start with an opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 8, one 9, and another 1. So, I have two 1s and one of each other digit. A safe and reasonable opening bid is '2 1s', reflecting the two 1s in my hand and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 47472808, I have a total of 2 '1's, 1 '4', 2 '7's, 1 '2', 1 '8', and 1 '0'. I don't have any '1's to add to the count, but I can bid on a digit that I have. The bid of 2 '1's is quite low, so I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I have two '7's and two '8's but no '9's or '6's or '3's, '5's. I can try to bid on a higher digit or increase the quantity if I have enough digits to make it reasonable. A bid of '3 7s' seems reasonable as I have two '7's.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 9, 1, 8, 2, 6, 1, 3, 4. I have zero 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, so for it to be valid, the opponent must have at least 3 7s, which is unlikely given the distribution of digits (each digit roughly appears 1-2 times on average per player). Since I have no 7s, and 3 is a relatively high count for one digit, it's reasonable to challenge the bid.
