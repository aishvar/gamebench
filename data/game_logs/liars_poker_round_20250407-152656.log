Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (73939637), I have three 3s, two 9s, one 7, and one 6. Since there's no current bid, I can start with any bid I want. Three 3s is a strong opening bid since I already know about three of them in my hand, making it a safe play that leaves room for higher bids later.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 84124060, I have zero 3s. Since the current bid is 3 3s, and I have no 3s, the entire count of 3s relies solely on my opponent's hand. For the bid to be valid, my opponent would need all 3 of those 3s, which is unlikely given 8 digits. The probability of one player having 3 of a specific digit out of 8 is quite low. Therefore, it's strategically sound to challenge the bid.
