--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, the digit '8' appears twice, which is relatively strong. Bidding on '8' is a good opening move because I already hold two of them, increasing the likelihood that there are more in the opponent's hand. A conservative yet solid opening bid is 2 eights.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 eights. Looking at my hand (52734165), I have zero 8s, so the entire count of 8s depends on Player 0's hand. The chance they have both 8s (making the bid valid) is relatively low, as the average expected count of any digit across both hands is roughly 1.6. Since I have none, it's unlikely there are two or more 8s total. Therefore, challenging is the best move here.
