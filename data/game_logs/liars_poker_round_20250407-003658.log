Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to make the first bid. I have two 5s and two 7s in my hand, which are the highest frequency digits. Bidding 4 5s or 4 7s seems reasonable as it's a safe starting point, considering the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 16 digits in total across both players.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 5 7s would be a reasonable bluff, as it's a small increase in quantity and keeps the digit the same. Alternatively, bidding a lower quantity with a higher digit could also be viable. Considering my hand, I have two 2s, one 1, one 4, one 5, one 9. Bidding 4 9s is also a possibility, but 5 7s seems more likely to succeed given the initial bid focused on 7s. I'll go with the slightly higher bid on the same digit.

Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. The current bid is 5 7s, which means there must be at least two more 7s in Player 1's hand to make the total 5. However, given that I already have three 7s, it's unlikely that Player 1 has two more 7s. Bidding 6 7s would require at least three 7s from Player 1, which seems highly improbable. Therefore, I should challenge the current bid.
