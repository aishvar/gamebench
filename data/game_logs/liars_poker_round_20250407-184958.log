Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid, I should make a reasonable starting bid. I have two 1s in my hand. A bid of '1' with a quantity of '2' is a safe opening bid, as it's unlikely the opponent has a lot of 1s. It's also not overly aggressive, allowing me to gather information on the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '1 2s'. I have 2 twos in my hand. Since I don't know the other player's hand, I can't be certain if the bid is valid or not. However, I can make a safe bid by increasing the quantity of twos, but since I only have 2 twos, I should bid on a digit I have more of. I have 2 nines, so I can bid '1 9s'. This bid is higher than the current bid and is safe because I know I have at least one nine.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 nine. I have zero nines in my hand. My opponent bid up from 1 two to 1 nine, which is a significant jump. While it's possible they have a nine, it's unlikely they have multiple. Bidding '2 9s' is too risky given my hand. Therefore, I will challenge the bid. If they are lying, I win. If they are telling the truth, I lose, but it is a calculated risk.
