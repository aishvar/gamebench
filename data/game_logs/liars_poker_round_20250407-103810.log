Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. I could challenge, but it's early in the game and 2 is a low quantity. I will increase the bid to 3 2s. I have one 2 in my hand, so there is a chance I win if challenged.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. I could challenge, but the opponent is a naive player. I'll bid slightly higher to see what they do. I'll bid 6 0s, since I have one 0 and it is a safe increase.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. To bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. I could bid 7 0s, but that seems weak. I could also bid 6 2s, 6 3s, etc. Since I have two 8s, bidding 6 8s seems like a reasonable bluff, as it's unlikely my opponent has many 8s either.
