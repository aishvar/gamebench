Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid is None, I need to make the first bid. I'll choose a digit with a high probability of occurrence in a random distribution. Since my hand contains a '5', I'll bid on the digit '5'. I'll also bid a quantity of 'Q' (8) which is the maximum possible quantity for the first bid.
