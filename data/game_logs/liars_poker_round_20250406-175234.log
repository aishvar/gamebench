Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 5s, two 0s, one 7, and one 4. The most frequent digits in my hand are 3s, 5s, and 0s with two occurrences each. A safe opening bid would be 2 of one of these digits. I'll choose 2 5s as my opening bid since 5 is a middle digit and common enough to be plausible.
