Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 4s, one 1, one 3, one 5, and one 8. The most frequent digits are 0 and 4, each appearing twice. A safe opening bid is 2 0s or 2 4s. Choosing 2 4s slightly favors a higher digit, which may be strategically better.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 13584049, I have two 4s, one 5, and one 0. The current bid is 2 5s. Since I already have one 5, it's plausible there are at least two 5s total, so challenging now would be risky. A safe and strategic move is to raise the bid slightly. I could bid 2 6s, but I don't have any 6s, so instead, I will bid 3 4s because I have two 4s myself, making this bid quite plausible.
