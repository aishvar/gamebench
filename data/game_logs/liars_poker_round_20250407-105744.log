Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 0s. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, I can confidently raise the bid to 3 0s based on my own hand alone. This is a safe and strategic way to increase the bid without risking an immediate challenge.

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 01694340, I have two 0s and zero 1s. The current bid is 3 1s, which requires at least three 1s across both hands. Since I have no 1s, that would mean the opponent must have all three or more 1s, which is unlikely given the distribution. Because the probability that the opponent has three or more 1s is quite low, I will challenge the bid.
