--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s and two 7s. A safe opening bid is often 2 of a digit I hold multiples of. Given this, bidding 2 8s leverages my hand strength and sets a reasonable opening.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s, so the bid of 2 9s relies entirely on Player 1 having both 9s, which is possible but not highly probable. Given that the total number of 9s is unlikely to exceed 2, bidding 3 9s would be risky. However, I do have two 8s in my hand. Since the previous bid was 2 8s, I can safely increase to 3 8s, which is a valid higher bid (higher quantity, lower digit), and likely to be true considering Player 1 might have at least one 8 as well.
