Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. I have two 0s in my hand, which is a good starting point. Bidding 2 0s is a safe and reasonable opening bid, as it's likely that the other player also has at least one 0, making the total count of 0s at least 3, but I'll start conservatively.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 0s. Given that there are 16 total digits in play, it's plausible that there are at least 3 0s across both hands. To maintain the bidding, I will raise the quantity to 3 while keeping the digit as 0.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 0s. Since I only have two 0s, it's unlikely there's a third 0 in the other player's hand. Bidding higher on 0s is risky. Instead, I can bid on another digit I have more of, like 5s or 6s, or challenge the current bid if I think it's unlikely. Given my hand, I have one 5 and one 6, so I can bid 3 5s or 3 6s. Bidding 3 5s seems safer as it increases the digit and is still plausible.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 5s. It is plausible that there are at least three 5s across both hands. To maintain a strong position and avoid challenging prematurely, I will bid 4 5s, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 5s. Given that there are only 16 total digits in play, it's unlikely there are more than 4 fives in total. I should challenge the bid as it seems improbable.
