--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no current bids, I can make any bid I want. I will start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 1s, and bidding 2 1s seems reasonable as a starting point.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 1s in my hand, so the bid of 2 1s is plausible but not particularly strong. Since there are 24 digits total, it's very likely there are at least 2 or more of other digits I hold multiple copies of. I observe I have two 7s and two 3s, so bidding 3 3s or 3 7s is a safe incremental raise supported by my hand. I'll raise to 3 7s as it increases the quantity and is supported by my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is '3 7s'. I have one 7 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are three 7s in total across all players' hands. Challenging seems like the best move.
