Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable bid based on the digits in my hand. I have two 6s and one 8. Bidding 3 6s seems like a safe starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 6.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, so the current bid of 3 6s must come entirely from Player 0's hand. Challenging would be risky as the bid is likely valid. Instead, I will make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 7s, as I have one 7 and hope Player 0 has enough to make the total at least 3.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 6s and one 7 in my hand. Since I have a 7, it's likely that the other player also has at least one 7. Bidding 4 7s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on the current bid and my hand.

Player 0 bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid since 8 is a higher digit than 7, and I have one 8, potentially making the total four if the opponent has three.
