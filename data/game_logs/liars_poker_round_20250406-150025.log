--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 3, 9, 4. I notice I have two 3s and two 4s, which are my highest counts for any digit. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid, I will start with 3 3s, as it's likely that at least one other player has a 3, making the total at least 3.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 2s and one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s. Since I have one 3, it's possible that there are at least 3 3s in total. However, bidding 4 3s seems risky without more information. Challenging the bid seems too risky, as there could plausibly be 3 3s. Bidding 4 2s is a reasonable move, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid can be beaten. My hand contains the digits: 1, 7, 5, 8, 4, 3, 5, and 1. I have two 5s, and my goal is to make a bid that is either higher in quantity or digit. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24, and there are only 8 digits in my hand, I should consider what digits I have and their potential counts across all players' hands. Given that I have two 5s and the current bid is 4 2s, I could consider bidding on a higher digit or increasing the quantity if I think it's feasible. However, without exact information on other players' hands, I must make an educated guess. I have two 5s, which could contribute to a higher bid if others have 5s as well.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 58314394, I have one 5. The current bid is 5 5s. Assuming roughly uniform distribution, the expected count of 5s across 24 digits is about 2.4, but bids can push higher based on private knowledge. Since I only have one 5, for the total to reach 5, the other two players would need to collectively hold at least four 5s, which is unlikely. Therefore, I suspect the current bid is an exaggeration, and challenging is the best move.
