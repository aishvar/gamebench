--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two 5s in my hand, I can start with a conservative bid. Bidding 2 5s is a safe starting point based on my own hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. I can see that bidding '3 5s' would increase the quantity, and bidding '2 6s' or higher would increase the digit. Since my hand contains a 6, 7, and 8, but no 5s or 9s, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. Given that I have no 5s, increasing the digit seems reasonable. I will bid '3 6s' as it seems reasonable and higher than the current bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (78616126). The total count of 6s must be at least 2 (mine) plus some from other players. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move as it increases the quantity. I will bid 4 6s.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand 49816073, I have one 6. The current bid is 4 6s, which means at least four 6s among all 32 digits. Since I only have one, the other three players collectively need to have at least three more 6s. Statistically, with 24 digits among them, expecting three or more 6s is plausible but not certain. Because the bid is still moderate and I have one 6 myself, it's risky to challenge now. A safe strategy is to increase the bid slightly to maintain pressure and gather more information.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, but no 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, which seems high given that I don't have any. However, with three other players, it's possible they have enough 7s to reach 4. Bidding 4 8s would be the next logical step, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, but I don't have any 8s either. Challenging seems risky but might be the better option given my hand.
