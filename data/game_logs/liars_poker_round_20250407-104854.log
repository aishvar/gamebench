Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. The current bid is 1 0s, which is consistent with my hand alone, so it's very plausible. Since I must raise, the most conservative valid raise is to increase the digit to 1 1s. I have one 1 in my hand, making this a safe minimal increase. Alternatively, I could increase quantity to 2 0s, but since I only see one zero, that's riskier. Therefore, the best strategic move is to bid 1 1s.
