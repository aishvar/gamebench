Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a good chance of having some high-value digits, but I don't know the exact distribution. I should start with a conservative bid to get a feel for the game. I'll bid on a digit that is likely to be present in most hands, which is the digit '8'. I have two 8s in my hand, so I'll bid 3 8s.
