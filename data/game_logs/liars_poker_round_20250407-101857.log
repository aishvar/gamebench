Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but not strong from my perspective. Since the minimum bid is very low, it would be premature to challenge now. I have two 4s and two 4s is a strong base to increase the bid. Therefore, a safe and reasonable next bid is 2 4s, increasing the quantity and switching to a digit I hold multiple of.
