Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning this is the first bid. I have two 6s, two 8s, one 4, one 5, and one 0 in my hand. Bidding 1 0s is a safe starting bid, as it's a low quantity and I have one in my hand. It's also a valid first bid.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 1 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 7, 2, 0, 4, 3, 9, 9, 5. I can see one 0 in my own hand. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, it's quite likely there could be more zeros in the opponent's hand, making a challenge risky. The minimal higher bid would be 1 1s, but I have no 1s. I do have two 9s, so a safe and strategic move is to bid 2 9s, increasing the quantity and leveraging my strong holding of 9s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding higher in quantity with 9s is risky. I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s is a reasonable option, increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I possess, like 6, 5, 4, 7, or 0. Bidding 3 8s seems the most strategic as it's a relatively safe increase from the current bid and utilizes information from my hand. I'm avoiding digits I have a lot of (like 6 or 8) in case I need to bluff later.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s and zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s. Since I have no 8s, the likelihood that there are at least 3 total 8s depends entirely on Player 0's hand. Given they bid 3 8s, it's possible they have 2 or 3 themselves, but it's risky. With no 8s on my side, I find it unlikely there are 3 or more in total, so challenging is the best move.
