Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 0 in my hand and two 6s. I can safely bid 2 6s, increasing the digit and quantity, as I know at least two 6s exist.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I don't have any 7s in my hand. I can raise the bid to 3 0s, as I have one 0 in my hand and it's likely there are at least 3 zeros in total across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. I could bid 3 of a higher number, but I only have two 6s. I could bid 4 0s, but that seems risky. I think I should bid 4 2s, as I have one 2. It is a safe increase.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. I could bid 5 3s, or I could bid 4 of a higher number. Given that the previous bids have been relatively low, I'll bid 5 3s. It is likely that there are at least 5 3s between both hands.
