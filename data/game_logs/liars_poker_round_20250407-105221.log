Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a low bid. I have one 1 in my hand, so bidding one 1 seems like a reasonable starting point.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 1s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 92665084, which contains no 1s. A reasonable next bid should be higher than 1 1s. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 1s and the quantity is low, I'll increase the digit. Bidding 1 2s is a valid next bid as it has the same quantity but a higher digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 2s. I don't have any 2s in my hand. Since the bid is low, I could bid higher, but I'll play it safe and bid a slightly higher quantity of a digit I have. I have a 1, so I will bid 2 1s.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I need to make a bid that is higher than this. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. My hand is 92665084, which contains no 1s. The total count of 1s across both hands must be at least 2 (the current bid), but since I have no 1s, all 2 1s must be in the opponent's hand. I will increase the quantity to 3. For the digit, I can either keep it as 1 or increase it. Increasing the digit seems reasonable, and I can bid on a digit that I have in my hand or a higher one. I have multiple 6s, so bidding on 6s could be a good strategy. I will bid 3 6s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 4 6s is a safe increase. I don't have enough information to challenge, and I need to make a valid bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have the hand 92665084, which contains two 6s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s, it's possible that there are more 6s in the other player's hand, making the total count potentially higher than 4. However, bidding more than 5 6s seems risky as it would require the other player to have at least three 6s. A safer and valid bid would be to increase the digit, so bidding 4 7s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 5 0s is a valid bid and doesn't rely on the number of 7s, which I'm unsure about.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. My hand is 92665084, which contains two 0s. To determine the likelihood of the bid being true, I need to consider the total count of 0s. I have 2 zeros, so the remaining 6 digits (Player 0's hand) must contain at least 3 zeros for the bid to be valid. This is possible but not certain. I should consider bidding higher or challenging. Bidding 5 1s is a valid move as it increases the digit. However, considering the history and my hand, I have a relatively high count of higher digits. I will bid 6 6s, which is a higher quantity and relates to a digit I have more information about.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 7 6s is a safe increase, but I could also bid a higher digit. Since I have a 0, and the bid history shows a bid of 5 0s, it's likely there are more 0s than 6s in play. I will bid 7 6s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have the hand 92665084, which contains three 6s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I have three 6s, it's likely that the total count of 6s is around or more than 6 (3 from my hand and potentially 3 or more from the other player's hand). Bidding 8 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, bidding 7 7s or higher is also an option. However, given that the current bid is 7 6s and I have some 6s, I will take a slightly more conservative approach by bidding 8 6s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 8 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. It's possible there are at least eight 6s in total, but it's also possible it's a bluff. Since I only have one 6, I'm not confident in raising the bid. However, I'm also not confident enough to challenge, as 8 out of 16 digits being 6s isn't entirely unreasonable. I'll play it safe and bid slightly higher. I will bid 9 0s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 9 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 0s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. The maximum quantity is 16, so I can bid up to 16. My hand is 92665084, which contains two 0s. I can count the number of 0s in my hand and potentially in the other player's hand based on the bid history. Since the last bid was 9 0s, and considering that my hand has 2 0s, it's possible the other player has a significant number of 0s. However, bidding 10 0s is the next logical step if I think there are more than 9 0s in total. I have to decide whether to challenge or make a new bid. Given that I have 2 0s, it's plausible that the total count of 0s could be 9 or more if the other player has at least 7 0s. However, the bid history doesn't strongly suggest that. I will analyze my hand for higher digits. I have one 9, no 8s, one 7, two 6s, three other digits. The current bid is on 0s, so I can either bid on a higher digit with the same quantity or more. Bidding 9 1s is a possibility since it's a higher digit than 0. I'll choose to bid 9 1s as it's a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. To increase the bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I will increase the digit to 2, keeping the quantity the same. Bidding 9 2s is a valid bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 2S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 9 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 2s. I have the digits 92665084, which contains two 2s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since increasing the quantity to 10 is possible and I know that there are at least two 2s (my own), I can consider bidding 10 2s. However, I should also consider the likelihood of the other player having a significant number of 2s. Given that the previous bids have been escalating and the other player has already bid 9 2s, it's possible they have a strong hand in 2s or are bluffing. I will bid 10 2s as it is a relatively safe increase.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 2s. I don't have any 2s in my hand. Bidding higher is risky, but challenging is also a gamble. Since the bid is already at 10, it's getting quite high. I will bid slightly higher to see if the other player will fold or challenge. I will bid 11 3s.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 11 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 11 3s. My hand is 92665084, which contains two 3s. To determine the likelihood of the bid being correct, I need to consider the total count of 3s. I have 2, and there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand, making 16 in total. The bid suggests that there are at least 11 threes. I have 2, so 9 threes must be in my opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution, it's possible but seems unlikely. However, I should consider the bidding history and the fact that my opponent is a strategic player. They might be bluffing, but the quantity is high. I should analyze if there's a reasonable chance they are telling the truth or if I should challenge. Bidding higher seems risky without more information about my opponent's hand. I will challenge the bid as it seems highly unlikely that my opponent has 9 threes.
