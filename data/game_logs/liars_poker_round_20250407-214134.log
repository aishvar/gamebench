Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning we are starting the game. With my hand being 52731278, I can see I have 2 '7's and 1 of each other digit. Since no bids have been made yet, I can start with a conservative bid that is likely to be valid but not too high. Bidding 1 '7' seems like a safe starting point as it's a low quantity and a specific digit I have in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have a full knowledge of my hand, I should make an initial bid that is conservative but also strategic. Given my hand '52731278', I can see I have multiple occurrences of certain digits. The digit '7' appears twice, which is a good starting point. With no current bid to compare against, I can start with a low but plausible bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (00443189), I have zero 7s. The current bid is 2 7s, meaning there must be at least two 7s across both hands. Since I have none, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have both 7s in their hand, which is possible but somewhat unlikely given the distribution. However, the bid is still plausible at this stage. Instead of challenging now, a strategic move is to increase the bid slightly to gather more information or pressure the opponent. The minimal valid raise is to 2 8s, since 2 7s < 2 8s. I have one 8, making this bid credible.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Analyzing the current bid of '2 8s' made by Player 1, I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if I should challenge. My hand contains the digits 5, 2, 7, 3, 1, 2, 7, 8. The current bid is '2 8s', so I must find a digit and quantity that exceeds this bid. I have two 7s and two 8s in my hand. Since the bid is on the quantity of 8s and I also have two 8s, I can bid higher on 8s or switch to another digit. I choose to bid on 8s because I have two of them, matching the quantity of the current bid but not exceeding it. However, I can try to bid on 7s as I have two of them.

Player 0 bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (00443189), I have zero 7s. The current bid is 3 sevens, implying there are at least three 7s combined in both hands. Since I hold none, all three would need to be in Player 0's hand, which is somewhat unlikely given they only hold 8 digits. The probability of having exactly three 7s in their hand is low, especially since earlier they only bid 2 7s, then raised to 3 7s, possibly as a bluff or pressure move. Given this, challenging is strategically sound.
