Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand (59173831), I observe that the digit '1' appears twice, which is the highest frequency of any digit in my hand. An opening bid typically starts conservatively. Therefore, a reasonable opening bid is 2 of the digit '1', reflecting my hand's count and assuming the opponent might have at least one more '1'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. To outbid, I can increase the quantity or the digit. My hand has three 2s, so bidding 3 2s is valid. This exceeds the previous bid in both quantity (3 > 2) and digit (2 > 1). Since I already have three 2s, the total count cannot be less than 3, making this bid safe.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 59173831, which contains zero 2s. The current bid is 3 2s, meaning there should be at least 3 twos across both hands. Since I have none, all three must be in Player 1's hand. The probability that Player 1's hand contains 3 or more 2s out of 8 digits is relatively low (roughly 11% assuming uniform distribution). Therefore, it is unlikely that the bid of 3 2s is valid, making a challenge the optimal move.
