Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with 2 2s is a safe opening because the total count must be at least 2 (my two 2s). This bid cannot be successfully challenged, forcing the opponent to make a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have a 2 in my hand. I can confidently bid on the digit 2, increasing the quantity from 2 to 3.

Player 1 bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. The opponent increased the bid from 2 2s to 3 2s, suggesting they might have at least one 2, making the total three. Challenging risks losing if they have one. Bidding 3 8s (a higher digit than 2) keeps the game active, leveraging my single 8 and hoping the opponent lacks sufficient 8s to challenge effectively.

Player 0 bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 4 8s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 1 bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The opponent's bid of 4 8s implies they need at least 3 additional 8s. Given the low probability of having 3+ 8s in their 8-digit hand (estimated ~3.8% assuming uniform distribution), challenging is statistically favorable. Previous bidding patterns suggest possible bluffing after my 3 8s bid. Challenging now has a high chance of success.
