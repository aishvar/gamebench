Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (98567310), I see a good distribution of digits. I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 7, one 8, and one 9. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the most frequent digit in my hand or a digit I think is likely to appear in both hands. Since I don't have a very high count of any single digit, I'll bid on a digit I have. I have one 8, so bidding on 8s seems reasonable. The lowest quantity I can bid is 1, but bidding 1 8s seems too low given there are 16 digits in total. A bid of 2 8s seems more reasonable as it suggests a minimum count and is not too high to be challenged immediately.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (4, 3, 6, 7, 5, 4, 9, 1), I have zero 8s. Since the current bid is only 2 8s, it's quite plausible that the opponent has two or even more 8s, so challenging now would be risky. The next valid bids are either 2 9s (same quantity, higher digit) or 3 of any digit. I have one 9, so bidding 2 9s is reasonable and safer than jumping to 3 of any digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, so the total count of 9s is at least 1. The bid of 2 9s is possible but seems a bit high given I only have one 9. However, it's not extremely unlikely since there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand, making it plausible they have at least one 9. I can bid higher to increase the quantity or keep the same quantity with a higher digit. Since the digit 9 is the highest, I must increase the quantity. Bidding 3 9s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 43675491, I have exactly one 9. The current bid is 3 9s, so for that bid to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least two 9s. Given the distribution of digits, it's somewhat unlikely for the opponent to have two or more 9s, although not impossible. Since I only have one 9 and the bid is already at 3, pushing the bid higher on 9s would be risky. Alternatively, bidding 3 of a higher digit (which would be 3 9s -> 3 9s impossible, so 3 of any digit above 9 is impossible), so the only way to raise is to increase quantity to 4 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s and two 7s. So, bidding 4 4s or 4 7s would be reasonable only if I expect the opponent to have at least two more of those digits, which is uncertain. Given the risk, it's better to challenge now, as the current bid of 3 9s is somewhat unlikely based on my hand.
