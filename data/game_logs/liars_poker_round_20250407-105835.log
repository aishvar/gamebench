Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 6, 0, 9, 5, 4, 2, 6. I see one '0' in my hand, and since the current bid is 1 0s, it's quite likely there is at least one more zero in the opponent's hand, making the bid very safe. To increase the bid, I can either bid more zeros or switch to a different digit. Noticing that I have two 6s, a stronger bid would be '2 6s', which is a strictly higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This is a safe incremental bid supported by my hand.
