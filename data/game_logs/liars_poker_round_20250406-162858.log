Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid in the game. Looking at my hand (76321691), I have: one 1, one 2, one 3, zero 4s, zero 5s, two 6s, one 7, zero 8s, and one 9. Since I have two 6s in my hand, that's a good digit to bid on. There are 16 total digits in the game (8 per player), so I should be conservative with my first bid. I'll bid '3 6s', which means I'm claiming there are at least 3 sixes total between both players. This is reasonable since I already have 2 sixes, and there's a decent chance my opponent has at least one more.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 6s: digits are 3, 3, 5, 0, 8, 9, 0, 4. Since I hold zero 6s, for the total to be at least 3, the opponent would need to have all 3 or more 6s in their hand, which is unlikely given random distribution across 8 digits. The probability that the opponent has 3 or more 6s is low, so challenging is the best move.
