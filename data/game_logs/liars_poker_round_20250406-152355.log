Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening move and I have two 2s, two 8s, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 9 in my hand, a conservative but solid opening bid would be 2 2s or 2 8s. Bidding 2 8s is slightly riskier but might exert more pressure since 8 is a high digit. I choose to open with 2 8s, reflecting my hand strength and setting a reasonable baseline.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 6 and no 8s in my hand. The quantity is not very high, and I don't have any information that would make me think it's definitely wrong. However, I can make a higher bid. Bidding 2 9s is a valid move as it has the same quantity but a higher digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, there is one 9. The current bid is 2 9s, which is plausible since I have one and the opponent likely has at least one as well. Making a minimal higher bid is strategically sound to avoid overcommitting. I also have two 2s, so bidding 2 2s is not higher, but bidding 3 2s would be a valid higher bid. Since I hold two 2s myself, it's likely there is at least one more 2 in the opponent's hand, making 3 2s a reasonable next bid.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 33761906, which contains one 3 (considered as a 3) and no 2s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. I see that I have a 3 and a 6 and a 9, which gives me some confidence in those digits. Bidding 3 3s seems reasonable because it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit, and I have one 3 in my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (89426572), I have one 2, one 8, one 9, and no 3s. The current bid is 3 3s, so for it to be valid, my opponent would likely need at least three 3s in their hand, which is somewhat unlikely but not impossible. Since I have no 3s, raising on 3s is risky. However, I do have one 9 and one 8, and since the previous bids included 2 8s and 2 9s, I can reasonably assume my opponent has at least one 9 or 8. Making a bid of 3 9s (same quantity, higher digit) is a safer incremental raise based on my hand, as it is plausible there are three 9s in total.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand contains the digits 3, 3, 7, 6, 1, 9, 0, 6. I have one 9, which means there are at least 2 nines elsewhere. The quantity of 3 nines is plausible. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there's only one 9 in my hand, bidding more than 3 nines seems risky unless I increase the digit. However, there are no digits higher than 9, so I must increase the quantity. The next possible bid is 4 0s. Given that I have a 0 and a 6, and possibly the opponent has other 0s, it's a reasonable bid. I'll bid 4 0s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (89426572), I have no zeros at all. The current bid is 4 zeros, which means the opponent is claiming there are at least four zeros across both hands. Since I have zero zeros, all four would have to be in their hand, which is unlikely given a hand size of eight. The probability of one player holding four or more zeros is low, so challenging is the best move.
