Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have two 6s in my hand. A conservative initial bid of 2 6s is a good starting point, as it's based on cards I know exist. It's a relatively low bid, but it establishes a baseline and doesn't reveal too much information about my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s. I can increase the quantity to 4 6s, which is a valid bid. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. Given my hand, bidding 4 6s is the most reasonable option as I have information about the presence of 6s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 5 6s. Given the bid history, the other player seems confident in 6s. Bidding higher in 6s is risky as it's unlikely they don't have any. However, I can bid 5 7s, which is a valid bid and slightly increases the digit. This is a reasonable next step without drastically increasing the risk.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have two 7s in my hand, which is not enough to increase the quantity. However, I have no 6s in my hand, and the last bid was 5 6s. It seems unlikely that the digit 6 is still the highest, so I should challenge the current bid.
