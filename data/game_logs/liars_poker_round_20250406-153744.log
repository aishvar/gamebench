Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 6s, one 5, one 4, one 8, and one 2. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be 2 6s or 2 9s, as I hold two of each, and statistically, the opponent is likely to have at least one more of these digits. To start conservatively yet with some strength, I'll open with 2 9s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (from 61344280), so there is at least one 9 in total. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have information about other digits in my hand or my opponent's hand, I'll play it safe. I can bid 3 9s because it's a higher quantity, or I can bid 2 [digit]s where [digit] is greater than 9, but since digits only go up to 9, bidding 3 of any digit is the next step. However, I see that I can bid 2 0s (since 0 is greater than 9 is not possible, but I can consider the next highest action). My hand has a 0, so bidding 3 0s is a reasonable action as it increases the quantity and is a valid bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s and no 0s. The current bid is 3 0s, which I cannot confidently challenge because it's quite plausible that the opponent holds at least three 0s between their eight digits. However, since I have two 9s, a bid of 3 9s matches the current quantity but with a higher digit, making it a legal and strategically sound raise. This leverages my strong count in 9s and puts pressure back on the opponent.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (from 61344280), so it's possible there are 3 or more 9s in total. However, considering the bid history and my hand, I can make a higher bid. I see I have a 6, and bidding 3 6s is a valid higher bid because 6 is greater than 5, and the quantity remains the same. However, to make a more informed decision, I should consider the likelihood of the other player having a high number of 9s. Given that I have one 9, it's reasonable to assume the other player might have at least two 9s, making 3 9s plausible. Nonetheless, increasing the quantity or digit is necessary for my bid. I will bid 4 0s as it's a valid higher bid and seems reasonable given my hand and the current state.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (69548296), I have no 0s. Since there are 8 digits in my opponent's hand, for the bid of 4 0s to be valid, my opponent must have at least 4 zeros, which is quite unlikely given the uniform distribution. The expected number of zeros in 8 random digits is less than 1. This makes the bid of 4 0s improbable, so challenging is the best move.
