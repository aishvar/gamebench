Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to make the first bid. In my hand, I have three 1s and two 6s, which are my strongest digits. Starting with a moderate bid of 3 1s seems reasonable, as I already have three 1s in my hand, making this bid safe and plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains only one '1'. The current bid is '3 1s', meaning the opponent likely has multiple '1's, or is bluffing. However, given there are 16 total digits and I have only one '1', it's plausible my opponent has at least two '1's. Without strong evidence to challenge immediately, it's safer to increase the bid slightly on a digit I have multiple of. I have two '5's, so bidding '3 5s' is a reasonable and safer choice at this stage.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, making it unlikely that there are many 5s across both hands. However, the current bid of 3 5s is plausible because Player 1 may have multiple 5s. I do have three 1s in my hand, and since the previous bid of 3 1s was my own, I know it's a safe and valid number to increase. To maintain a stronger position, I will bid 4 1s, raising the quantity while switching back to a digit I have confidence in.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have exactly one '1' in my hand. This means Player 0 would need at least three '1's in their own hand to meet the current bid. Given that Player 0 initially bid 3 1s and then increased to 4 1s after my bid of 3 5s, it suggests they likely have multiple '1's. However, having at least three '1's is plausible but not certain. My hand contains only one '5', one '1', and no digit is strongly represented. Given the uncertainty and the relatively low bid, it is risky to challenge immediately. Instead, I will raise the bid slightly to a digit I have multiple occurrences ofâ€”such as '3', '5', or '7'. However, my hand has only one occurrence of each digit, providing no strong reason to confidently bid higher on any digit. Yet, since challenging at this low bid is risky, I'll cautiously increase the digit from '1' to a higher digit at the same quantity to remain conservative. I'll bid 4 3s, slightly increasing the digit to maintain pressure without significantly increasing risk.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. In my hand, I have one 3, which means there need to be at least three more 3s in Player 1's hand to meet the bid. While this is possible, it is not guaranteed. To avoid challenging prematurely, I will increase the bid to 4 6s since I have three 6s in my hand, making it more plausible that there are at least four 6s in total across both hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 15257340, which contains the digits 1, 5, 2, 5, 7, 3, 4, and 0. I have no 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s, meaning there must be at least four 6s across both players' hands. Since I have none, my opponent would need to have all four 6s in their eight-digit hand. This seems unlikely. Therefore, challenging this bid is the best strategic move.
