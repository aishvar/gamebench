Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, meaning this is the first bid. I have two 6s, two 9s, one 7, one 8, and one 0. A safe first bid would be to bid on a digit I have, increasing the quantity slightly. Bidding 2 6s seems reasonable as a starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand and the current bid is only 2 6s, which is relatively low. It's safer to raise the quantity to 3 with a digit I hold multiple times. So I'll bid 3 5s because it's likely the other player has at least one 5 to help reach that total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have two 6s in my hand, and the previous bid was 2 6s, so there's a possibility of more 6s in my opponent's hand. I also have two 9s. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable increase, leveraging my hand. Alternatively, bidding 3 6s would also be valid. However, since I have two 9s, bidding 4 9s is also a valid option. Considering the opponent bid 3 5s after I bid 2 6s, they might be trying to push a digit they have few of. I will bid 4 6s as I have two of them and it's a reasonable increase over the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand. It seems highly unlikely the opponent could hold 4 6s by themselves, making the total less than 4. I will challenge.
