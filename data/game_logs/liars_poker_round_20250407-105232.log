Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. The current bid is 1 0s, which is quite conservative given there are 16 digits total, and I already see one 0 myself. It is very likely there is at least one more 0 in Player 0's hand, so challenging now would be unwise. A natural and safe progression is to raise the bid slightly. Since I have one 0, bidding 2 0s is very reasonable and keeps the pressure on Player 0.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (20488751), I have one '1'. The current bid is 2 1s, so for that to be valid, opponent must have at least one '1'. That's plausible given 8 digits. Instead of challenging a likely valid bid, I should increase it. I also have two '8's, making a bid of 2 8s at the same quantity no improvement, but I can raise to 3 8s, leveraging my strong count. This is a safe, incremental, and stronger bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s and one 9. The current bid is 3 9s, which requires at least two more 9s in Player 0's hand. Given the naive nature of Player 0, they might be bluffing or overestimating. The probability of Player 0 holding two or more 9s is relatively low, especially since I hold only one 9. Therefore, challenging this bid is the best strategic move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
