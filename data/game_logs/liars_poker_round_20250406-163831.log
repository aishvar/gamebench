Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game, so I need to start with a reasonable bid based on my hand. I have one 9, one 5, two 7s, two 4s, one 6, and one 8. A safe starting bid would be 2 7s, as I already have two 7s in my hand, and it's likely that my opponent has at least one 7 as well, making this a strong opening bid.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 09744138, I have a total of 3 sevens (two 7s are not present but one 7 is). I also have two 9s which could potentially be used to make a higher bid. However, I don't have enough 9s to make a bid of 3 or more 9s. The best option seems to be bidding on a digit that I have multiple instances of and increasing the quantity. I have three 4s, but bidding 3 or more 4s seems risky without knowing the distribution of other digits. A safer bet seems to increase the quantity of 7s as I have one 7 and it could be a good starting point.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, which makes the current bid of 3 7s plausible. However, I believe there is room to increase the bid. Since I have good visibility on the 7s and there are likely more in Player 1's hand, I will raise the bid to 4 7s, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider my hand and the current bid. My hand contains the digits 0, 9, 7, 4, 4, 1, 3, 8. I have two 7s and two 4s and one 1, one 3, one 8, one 0, and one 9. The current bid is 4 7s. I can see that bidding 5 7s or higher would be risky without knowing the distribution of 7s in Player 0's hand. However, I can try to bid higher with a different digit. I have two 4s and the current bid does not contain any 4s, so bidding 4 4s could be a possibility if I thought it was likely to be higher than their 7s count. But first, let's consider if challenging could be an option.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s, and I have two 8s in my hand. Given that the maximum possible total count for any digit is 16, it is plausible there are at least three more 8s in Player 1's hand to meet the bid. However, I cannot be certain there are significantly more than five 8s in total. To stay in the game and avoid challenging prematurely, I will make a higher bid of 6 8s, as it slightly increases the quantity while keeping the same digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 8S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 6 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more likely to succeed. My hand contains the digits 0, 9, 7, 4, 4, 1, 3, 8. I have one 8, so I know there are at least 7 8s in total (6 from the bid history + 1 from my hand). Given this, bidding a higher quantity seems risky without more information. However, I can try to bid higher with a different digit. Since I have two 4s and two 7s are not present but 7s were previously bid, I can consider bidding on 7s as I have two of them.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. In my hand, I have two 7s. This means there would need to be at least five more 7s in Player 1's hand to meet the bid, which seems plausible but not guaranteed. However, I also have a strong hand for 8s, with three 8s present. To avoid challenging prematurely and to maintain a stronger position, I can make a higher bid of 8 8s, leveraging my hand and increasing both the quantity and the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 8S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 8 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 8s. Given that I have one 8 in my hand and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I need to assess if bidding higher or challenging is the best move. Since the bid is already at 8 8s and I only have one 8, challenging seems like a reasonable option because it's unlikely that there are 8 or more 8s in total. However, I also need to consider if I can make a valid higher bid.
