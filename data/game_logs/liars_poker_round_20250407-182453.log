Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, as the first player I need to make an opening bid. Looking at my hand, the digit '1' appears once, '0' once, '3' once, '4' once, '6' once, '7' once, '8' once, and '0' once. The digit '1' appears once, which is typical. A safe opening bid is usually '2' of a common digit, since with 16 total digits, most digits are expected to appear around 3 times across both hands. Choosing '2' of a digit I hold at least one of is reasonable. I'll pick '2 1's as the opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. My hand contains no 1s, so I cannot make a higher bid for 1s. However, I can bid on a different digit that I have more of, such as 3s or 6s, which I have three of each. Since the bid must be higher in either quantity or digit, I will bid 3 3s, as it exceeds the current bid in quantity and is a valid move.

Player 1 bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s, meaning at least three 3s across both hands. Looking at my hand (76310841), I have zero 3s. Therefore, all three 3s must be in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. Since having three of the same digit in a random 8-digit hand is somewhat unlikely (though possible), this is a risky bid. The probability favors that there are fewer than 3 total 3s. Given that, challenging the bid is the best strategic move.
