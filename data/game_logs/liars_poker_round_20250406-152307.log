Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (08975013), I see a mix of digits with no repeating numbers. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the likelihood of a digit appearing across both hands. Since there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's, I can make an educated guess. The digit '0' appears twice in my hand, so bidding on '0' seems reasonable. I'll start with a quantity of 3 for the digit '0', as it's a conservative estimate considering my two '0's and the possibility of my opponent having at least one.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. The current bid is 3 zeros, which would require at least two zeros in the opponent's hand. This is plausible, but not guaranteed. Since it's early and the bid is still low, I can safely increase the bid slightly to maintain pressure without overcommitting. I will increase the digit to 3 1s, as I have one 1 in my hand, and it's a minimal strictly higher bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have a lot of information about the other player's hand, I'll play it safe and increase the digit. Bidding 3 2s is a reasonable next step as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 2S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 69513470, I have the digits: 6, 9, 5, 1, 3, 4, 7, 0. Counting 2s, I have zero. The current bid is 3 2s, meaning at least three 2s across both hands. Since I have zero, all three (or more) would need to be in Player 0's hand, which is unlikely. The probability of one player holding three or more of the same digit is fairly low in 8 digits. Therefore, it's a good opportunity to challenge.
