Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I want to start with a conservative yet reasonable opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 4, one 5, one 6, two 8s, one 9, three 8s total (counting carefully). Since I have two 8s, a safe starting bid would be 2 8s, as it's likely there are at least two 8s across both hands. This is a standard opening bid that doesn't overcommit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. My hand is 66921483, which contains one 8. For the current bid to be false, the opponent must have zero 8s in their 8-digit hand, which seems unlikely. Challenging is therefore risky. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 6s. Bidding 3 6s is a valid higher bid (increasing quantity from 2 to 3) and is supported by my hand, requiring only one 6 from the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6. Given the total of 16 digits, a bid of 3 6s is plausible, as my opponent likely has at least two 6s or is bluffing. Since I only have one 6, bidding 3 7s would be a minimal raise and relatively safe, as 7s are somewhat common and I have one 7 in my hand. Alternatively, I could bid 3 8s, as I also have one 8, and the initial bid was already 2 8s. This would be a safe incremental raise without overly committing. Therefore, I will raise to 3 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (66921483). For the bid to be true, the opponent needs at least two 8s in their 8-digit hand. This is plausible, making a challenge risky. I previously bid 3 6s, and I hold two 6s. Bidding 4 6s is a logical next step, leveraging my known strength in 6s and increasing the quantity. This requires the opponent to have at least two 6s, which seems like a reasonable possibility to bid on, putting pressure back on them.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 45869387, I have one 6 and two 8s. The current bid is 4 6s, which requires there to be at least four 6s across both hands. Since I only have one 6, the opponent would need to have at least three 6s, which is somewhat unlikely given the distribution of digits. Additionally, since I hold two 8s, a safer higher bid could be 4 8s, which is plausible because I just need the opponent to have at least two 8s. This is more reasonable than assuming they have three 6s. Therefore, instead of challenging now, I will increase the bid to 4 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 6s and one 8. The current bid is 4 8s, placed by Player 0. Player 0 has consistently bid on 8s (2 8s, 3 8s, 4 8s), suggesting they might hold several 8s, making a challenge risky. I previously bid 3 6s and 4 6s based on my hand. Continuing this line, bidding 5 6s is a logical next step. This bid leverages my two 6s, requiring only three 6s from Player 0's hand of 8 digits. This seems more plausible and safer than challenging the 4 8s or bidding on a digit I have fewer of. It puts the pressure back on Player 0.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 45869387, I have one 6. The current bid is 5 6s, which would require there to be at least 4 more 6s in Player 1's hand. Since each player only has 8 digits, it's statistically unlikely that Player 1 has 4 or more 6s. The average expected count of any digit per player is 0.8 (8 digits / 10 digits), so 5 total 6s is already quite high. Given my single 6, the bid seems aggressive and unlikely to be valid, so challenging is the best move.
