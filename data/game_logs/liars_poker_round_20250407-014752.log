Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand (07224580), I have: one 0, one 7, two 2s, one 4, one 5, one 8, and zero of other digits. Since I have two 2s in my hand, that's a good starting point. There are 16 total digits in play (8 in my hand, 8 in my opponent's hand), so any bid I make should be reasonable. I'll start with a moderate bid of 3 2s, suggesting there's at least one more 2 in my opponent's hand, which is fairly likely.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 2s in my hand. The current bid requires at least three 2s across both players. Given there are only 8 digits per player, the probability that Player 0 holds three or more 2s is statistically low (~4% based on binomial distribution). This makes their bid likely a bluff, so challenging is advantageous.
