Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. Given that there are 16 digits total and the current bid is only 1 0s, it is very likely that there is at least one more 0 in Player 0's hand, making the current bid quite safe. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or increase the digit. Since raising the quantity is safer and keeps options open, I will bid 2 0s, which is a minimal but valid raise.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 3, 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 6, 4, which includes one '1' and one '0'. The current bid is 2 1s, which is plausible since I hold one '1' and my opponent might reasonably have one as well. To increase the bid, I can either choose a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I hold one '0' and already bid 2 0s earlier, and zeros tend to appear with average frequency, a safe incremental bid is 2 2s, as I have one '2' and the opponent might have one as well. Alternatively, I could bid 3 0s, leveraging my known zero, since 3 zeros across 16 digits is quite common. Therefore, I will increase the quantity on zeros to 3 0s, which is a safe and strategic bid.
