Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, one 1, one 6, two 7s, one 8, and one 6. A safe opening bid is typically 2 of a digit I have multiple of. I have two 0s and two 7s, so I'll bid 2 7s to reflect my hand strength and avoid overcommitting early.
