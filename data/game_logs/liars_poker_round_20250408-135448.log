Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game, and I need to start with something strategic. Looking at my hand (15867328), I have one of each of these digits: 1, 5, 8, 6, 7, 3, 2, 8. I notice I have two 8s in my hand. Since I know for certain there are at least 2 8s in play, this is a safe opening bid. I could bid higher, but starting conservatively gives me room to maneuver later while still making a claim based on what I know for certain.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 71997610, which contains digits 7, 1, 9, 9, 7, 6, 1, and 0. I have no 8s in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, meaning Player 0 believes there are at least two 8s across both hands. Since I have none, Player 0 would need to have at least two 8s in their own hand for their bid to be valid. With 8 digits per player, it's plausible Player 0 could indeed have two or more 8s. Without strong evidence to the contrary, challenging would be risky. Therefore, I should make a slightly higher bid instead. I have two 7s in my hand, making a bid of 3 7s plausible, as Player 0 only needs one additional 7 for the bid to be valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand (the fourth digit). The current bid is '3 7s', meaning there need to be at least 3 sevens total between both players' hands. For this to be true, Player 1 would need to have at least 2 sevens in their hand. While this is possible, it's not guaranteed. I have one 8 in my hand, and I previously bid '2 8s', suggesting I believed there were at least 2 eights total. I could increase to '4 7s', but that would be risky as it would require Player 1 to have 3 sevens. I could also bid '3 8s', which increases the digit while keeping the same quantity. Since I know I have one 8, this would require Player 1 to have at least 2 eights, which is similar in likelihood to them having 2 sevens. I'll go with '3 8s' as my bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 71997610, which contains digits: 7,1,9,9,7,6,1,0. I have zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, meaning my opponent claims there are at least three 8s between our two hands. Since I have none, all three must be in my opponent's hand. While it's possible, it seems statistically unlikely that my opponent has three or more 8s out of their eight digits. Given the risk and improbability, it's strategically safer to challenge this bid rather than escalate.
