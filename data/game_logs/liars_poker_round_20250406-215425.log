Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s, which is very low. I have two 1s in my hand and a total of 8 digits in play. I can confidently bid 2 1s, which is a valid higher bid both in quantity and digit, considering I have the digits to support it.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand and two 2s. The current bid is 2 2s, which is reasonable given the total digits. However, I can increase the bid by calling 3 2s, as I have the potential to support that claim with my hand. This keeps the bid within a believable range while also increasing the quantity.
