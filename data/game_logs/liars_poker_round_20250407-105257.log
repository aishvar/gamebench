Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. My hand is 12692580, which contains one 1, one 2, one 6, one 9, two 2s (correction: actually only one 2), one 5, one 8, and one 0. The most common digits in my hand are all appearing only once, so a conservative opening bid is 2 of some digit that I have. I will start with '2 2s' because I have one 2, and it's reasonable to expect at least one more 2 in the opponent's hand.
