Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 8s, and two other digits (3, 6, 7). A common opening is to bid on digits I have multiple of. I will start with a conservative but reasonable bid of 2 5s, reflecting my hand and leaving room to increase later.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, which makes it less likely that the bid of 2 5s is true. However, it is still possible that Player 0 has two or more 5s, so challenging at this point could be risky. To maintain a stronger position, I will make a higher bid based on the digits I do have. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 3 9s increases the quantity and shifts to a digit I can confidently support.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, making it unlikely there are 3 or more 9s in total since that would require my opponent to have all three or more. This is improbable given a uniform distribution of digits. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best strategic move.
