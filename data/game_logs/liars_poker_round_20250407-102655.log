--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, two 8s, one 0, one 1, one 2, and one 3. Opening with a bid that reflects my hand strength is strategic. The most common digits in my hand are 4s and 8s (each appearing twice). A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 4s, as it reflects my hand and allows room for future increases.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 4s (digits: 4, 2, 0, 4, 8, 1, 3, 8). The current bid is 2 5s, which I could reasonably expect to be true or false, but since I have no 5s myself, I don't have strong evidence to challenge yet. A safe and natural higher bid is 3 4s, since I hold two 4s and it's plausible my opponent has at least one 4, making the total at least 3. This increases the quantity while reverting to a digit I have strong holdings in.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 4, 2, 0, 4, 8, 1, 3, 8. There are no 5s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s, which means Player 1 is claiming there are at least three 5s across both hands. Since I have zero 5s, for the bid to be true, Player 1 would need to have all three or more 5s in their hand. This is possible but statistically unlikely, as the average count per digit over 16 digits is around 1.6. The probability that Player 1 has at least 3 of a specific digit is low enough that challenging is a strong move here.
