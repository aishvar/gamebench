Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I don't have any 4s in my hand. I could bid 3 5s, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit. Or I could bid 4 of any digit. Since I have two 1s and one 3, and the bidding history shows some interest in those digits, I'll bid 4 1s.
