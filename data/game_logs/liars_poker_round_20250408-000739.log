Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None. Given my hand contains a 4 and a 6, I should start with a conservative bid to establish a baseline. A bid of 2 4s is a reasonable starting point, as it's based on my actual hand and doesn't overcommit to a specific digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 2 4s. Bidding 2 5s is a valid higher bid since 5 is greater than 4, and I can confirm at least two 5s exist.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Bidding 3 5s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand, but I should also consider the previous bid from Player 0, which was 2 4s, so I might want to bid a higher digit.

Player 0 bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which would require Player 0 to have at least two 6s. Given the uncertainty and the risk of the bid being too high, challenging is the safer option.
