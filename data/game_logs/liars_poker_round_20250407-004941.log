Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (57228901), I have one 2 twice. Since this is the first bid and I want to start conservatively while still having confidence in my claim, bidding 3 2s seems reasonable. This leaves room for just one more 2 between both hands while being high enough to force meaningful decisions from my opponent.

Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 2s, so the likelihood of there being at least 3 twos depends entirely on Player 0's hand. Given 16 digits total, it's plausible Player 0 holds 3 or more twos, but it's far from certain. Since the bid is relatively low, challenging now is risky. Instead, I can safely raise the bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have three 9s in my hand, so bidding 3 9s is reasonable and strategically sound.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. For the opponent's bid of '3 9s' to be true, they would need at least 2 more 9s in their hand. While possible, I can make a safer bid based on what I know. I have two 2s in my hand, but I already bid on 2s. Looking at my hand, I see I can confidently bid '4 5s' since I already have one 5, and this is a reasonable increase in quantity that doesn't require too many digits from the opponent's hand to be true.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 97835591, I have two 5s and two 9s. The current bid is 4 5s, which means there must be at least four 5s total across both hands. Since I have two 5s, the opponent would need at least two more 5s for the bid to be valid. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely. Alternatively, I can raise the bid. Since I have two 9s, a bid of 4 9s is plausible and strictly higher (same quantity, higher digit). This puts pressure back on the opponent without overcommitting.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (57228901), I only have 0 nines. The opponent bid '4 9s', claiming there are at least 4 nines total. Since I have none, this would mean they would need to have at least 4 nines in their 8 digits, which is quite unlikely. Given the bid history shows they raised from my '4 5s' to '4 9s', they might be bluffing. A challenge seems like the best move.
