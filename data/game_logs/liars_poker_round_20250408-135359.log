Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains digits: 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 7, 1, 9. I have two 7s, which is the digit I have the most of. Starting with a conservative yet confident bid, given I already have two 7s, it is reasonable to assume there might be at least one more 7 in the opponent's hand. Therefore, bidding 3 7s is a safe and logical opening move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 67560858, I have one 7. The current bid is 3 7s, which requires there to be at least two 7s in the opponent's hand to be valid. This is plausible, so challenging now is risky. To increase the bid, I can either bid 3 8s since I have two 8s, making that a safer bid, or raise the quantity. Given my two 8s, bidding 3 8s is a reasonable and safe higher bid that surpasses 3 7s by digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand (02574719) contains no digit '8'. The opponent's bid is '3 8s', meaning they likely have some 8s themselves, but for the bid to hold true, they would need to have at least three 8s in their own hand. Given that I have none, it's risky to believe they have three or more 8s. However, with 8 digits per player, it's still plausible. My previous bid was '3 7s', and my hand contains two 7s. Increasing the bid to '4 7s' is reasonable because I already have two, needing only two more from the opponent's 8-digit hand, which is plausible.

Player 0 bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s and zero 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, which requires there to be at least four 7s among all 16 digits. Since I have zero 7s, the opponent would need to have all four or more 7s, which is quite unlikely. The probability of them having four or more 7s is low, so challenging this bid is a strategically sound move.
