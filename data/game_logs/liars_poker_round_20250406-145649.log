Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains the digits 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9. I see that I have two 5s and one 7, and no other digits appear more than once. A reasonable starting bid, considering my hand and the possibility of others having similar or higher digits, would be to start with a low quantity of a higher digit or a moderate quantity of a lower digit. I have two 5s, so bidding 2 5s seems like a good starting point as it reflects my hand and leaves room for others to have digits that could make the bid more believable or harder to challenge.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 5. Since there are 24 digits in total and the current bid is only 2 5s, it's quite plausible that there are at least two 5s among all hands. Challenging now would be premature. A safe way to increase the bid is to keep the quantity the same but raise the digit, or to increase the quantity with a digit I have confidence in. I have two 1s, so bidding 3 1s is a reasonable and safe increase.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have two 8s in my hand, which suggests that there might be a reasonable number of 8s in play. However, bidding on 8s might be risky as it could be challenged. Instead, I can challenge the current bid of 3 1s, as it seems likely that there are at least 3 1s in play given the bid history and my hand.
