--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player, I want to make a conservative yet reasonable opening bid. My hand contains two 1s, two 9s, two 0s, one 5, and one 8. Statistically, with 24 digits total, each digit should appear roughly 2-3 times. Given I have two 1s, a safe opening bid is 3 1s, which is plausible and sets a baseline without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 36871454, I can see I have a 1, which could contribute to a higher bid if others have more 1s. However, I also have other digits that could potentially be higher. I have three 6s and other digits, but no other 1s. I should consider bidding on a digit I have or increasing the quantity slightly if I think others might have more of that digit. Given I have one 1 and the bid is only for 3 1s, I should consider if I can safely bid higher on a digit I have. I have one 1, so bidding on 1s or another digit with a higher quantity seems reasonable. I have no 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, or 7s, but I do have several other digits. A safe bet is to bid higher on a digit I have, like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. Among these, 4, 5, and 6 seem promising because I have multiple instances of them.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are four 6s in total among all players' hands. Challenging seems like the best move.
