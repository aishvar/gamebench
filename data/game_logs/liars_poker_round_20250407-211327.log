Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, the digit '0' appears three times (digits: 1,4,6,0,9,2,0,6). '0' is the most frequent digit in my hand. Statistically, the combined total of '0's across both hands is likely at least 3, possibly more, but opening conservatively with a bid of 3 zeros is reasonable to start the game without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Let me analyze this carefully. In my hand of 23992877, I have zero '0's. For the bid of '3 0s' to be true, the opponent would need to have 3 zeros in their hand. While this is possible, it seems unlikely given that zeros appear with roughly equal frequency as other digits. Since I can see no zeros in my hand, and the opponent would need exactly 3 zeros (quite specific), challenging seems safer than raising the bid. If I were to raise, I'd need to either bid 4 or more zeros (very unlikely) or bid 3 of a higher digit (which could be risky without more information).
