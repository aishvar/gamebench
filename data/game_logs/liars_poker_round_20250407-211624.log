--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand (78560234), I count the digits: 7(1), 8(1), 5(1), 6(1), 0(1), 2(2), 3(1), 4(1). The digit with the highest count is '2' with 2 occurrences. A safe opening bid is usually 2 of a digit I hold multiple times, as there are 16 digits in total and it's likely the opponent also has at least one '2'. Therefore, I will open with a bid of 2 twos.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s, which is a relatively low bid. Given the small number of bids made so far, it's likely that there are still many digits left to reveal. Therefore, a high bid is likely to be valid. However, since the current bid is low, we should challenge it to try to limit the opponent's options.
