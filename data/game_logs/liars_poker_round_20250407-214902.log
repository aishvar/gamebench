Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 32916561, the most frequent digit is '1' appearing twice, followed by '6' also twice. A good opening strategy is to bid on a digit I have multiple of, maximizing the likelihood the total count is higher. I will start with a conservative but solid opening bid of 2 ones, as it's a common digit and I have two already. This sets a reasonable baseline and puts pressure on the opponent.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 ones. I have no ones in my hand. The maximum possible ones is 16. It is plausible that there are at least 2 ones in the other player's hand. I will bid higher to stay in the game. I will bid 2 twos.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 3, 2, 9, 1, 6, 5, 6, 1. I have one '2' in my hand. The current bid is 2 2s, which implies there are at least two 2s across both hands. Since I only have one '2', the opponent would need to have at least one '2' to make the bid valid. This is plausible, so challenging now is risky. The next valid bid must be either 3 of any digit, or 2 of a higher digit (3 or above). Looking at my hand, I have two '1's, two '6's, and one '5', '3', and '9'. Since I have two '1's, I can safely raise to 3 1s, assuming the opponent has at least one '1', which is reasonable. This is a safer incremental bid than raising the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. The maximum possible number of 1s is 16. It's possible that there are at least three 1s between the other player's hand. I could bid higher, but there's a chance the previous bid is a bluff. I will bid a slightly higher quantity of a digit I have in my hand to test the waters. I have two 8s, so I will bid 4 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 ones. I have no ones in my hand. The maximum number of ones across both hands is 16. It is plausible that there are 3 ones across both hands. To bid, I must increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 8s in my hand. I could bid 3 2s, 3 3s, 3 4s, 3 5s, 3 6s, 3 7s, 3 8s, 3 9s, or 3 0s, or I could increase the quantity to 4 and bid any digit. I will bid 4 0s. It is unlikely, but possible that there are four 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 3, 2, 9, 1, 6, 5, 6, 1. There are no zeros in my hand. The opponent has bid that there are 4 zeros total across both hands. Since I have zero zeros, for their bid to be true, the opponent must have all 4 zeros in their hand of 8 digits. While possible, it is statistically unlikely that half of their hand consists of zeros. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best strategic move.
