Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s, two 7s, and single instances of digits 9, 2, and 3. Since there is no current bid, it's safest to start with a digit I have multiple instances of. I'll bid conservatively to start, choosing '2 7s' as I have two 7s in my hand, making it a reasonable initial bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have a hand of 49589884, which contains two 8s, two 9s, one 5, and one 4, with no 7s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and considering my hand, bidding 3 5s seems reasonable as it is higher in quantity than the current bid and there is a 5 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains digits: 1, 9, 1, 2, 2, 7, 3, 7. I have no 5s. The opponent bid 3 5s, meaning they might have some 5s, but since I have none, it seems uncertain if there are really three or more 5s across both hands. However, with 8 unknown digits, it is plausible that the opponent has at least three 5s. Challenging at this point is risky without more evidence. Instead, I can safely bid higher with digits I hold multiple of, such as '3 7s', since I already have two 7s, making it more likely there is at least one more 7 in the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have the hand 49589884, which contains two 8s, two 9s, one 5, and one 4. There are no 7s in my hand. Given that the bid is 3 7s, I need to consider if I can make a valid higher bid or challenge. Since I don't have any 7s, I will focus on making a bid that is higher than 3 7s. A reasonable bid would be to increase either the quantity or the digit. I can see there's a possibility of having higher digits in my hand that could make a strong bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 19122737, containing digits 1, 9, 1, 2, 2, 7, 3, and 7. I have no 8s. The opponent bid 4 8s, meaning they are claiming at least four 8s across both hands. Since I have zero 8s, all four would need to be in their hand alone. While possible, it's statistically unlikely they hold exactly half their digits as 8s. Thus, challenging this bid is the safer and more logical action.
