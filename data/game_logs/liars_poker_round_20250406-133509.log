Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (41003599), I have: one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 5, and two 9s. Since I have two 9s in my hand, that's my strongest digit. However, I should be strategic about my opening bid. I don't want to bid too high and risk being challenged, but I also want to make a reasonably strong bid. Since I know there are at least two 9s (the ones in my hand), bidding '3 9s' seems reasonable - it's asserting there's just one more 9 in my opponent's hand, which is quite possible. This is a moderately aggressive but defensible opening bid using my strongest digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 26068432, I have no 9s at all. The current bid is 3 9s, which would require my opponent to have all 3 or more 9s in their hand, or at least 3 combined. Since I have zero, it's unlikely there are 3 or more 9s in total. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
