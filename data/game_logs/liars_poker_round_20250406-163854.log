Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains the digits 3, 2, 3, 7, 0, 0, 9, 4. I see that I have two 0s, which is a good starting point. I can start with a conservative bid to test the waters.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I do not have any 0s in my hand, which makes it less likely that there are many 0s overall. However, I have two 7s in my hand, which suggests that a bid involving 7s is more likely to succeed. To make a valid higher bid, I will increase the digit to 7 and keep the quantity at 2, as this is the smallest valid increase.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 7S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. I can see that bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit could be advantageous. Since my hand contains two 6s, I could make a bid of 3 6s or higher. However, I should also consider the possibility of challenging if I think the bid is unlikely. Given that the current bid is 2 7s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 6s, so bidding 3 6s seems reasonable and higher than the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 6s. It is reasonable to assume there could be at least three 6s across both hands, but I want to increase the bid strategically. I also have two 7s in my hand, making a bid of 4 7s a logical step as it increases both the quantity and changes the digit to one I have more of.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 3, 2, 3, 7, 0, 0, 9, 4. I have a total of 2 7s and 2 0s, 2 3s, 2 6s are not present but 2 0s and other digits are. The maximum possible quantity for any digit across both players' hands is 16. Given that the current bid is 4 7s, I should consider if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is more prudent. Since I have two 7s in my hand, I know there are at least 2 7s in total. The current bid is 4 7s, so I must either have a higher quantity or a higher digit. I can bid higher than 4 7s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. A bid of 5 0s seems reasonable as I have two 0s, and it's higher in quantity than 4 7s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have no 0s in my hand, so I cannot directly support this bid. However, based on probability, it is possible that Player 0 is bluffing or overestimating. Since I have three 7s in my hand, bidding 5 7s is a reasonable move. This matches the current quantity but increases the digit, making it a valid bid and leveraging my strong position with 7s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 3, 2, 3, 7, 0, 0, 9, 4. I have a total of 2 sevens, but I also have 3 zeros, 2 threes, and 2 twos. The bid of 5 7s seems high given that I only have 1 seven and no information about Player 1's hand. However, I do have 2 zeros, which could be useful. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should consider if I can reasonably make a higher bid. The current bid is 5 7s, so I need to bid higher than this. I could bid 6 0s as I have two zeros, increasing the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have no 0s in my hand, making it unlikely that there are 6 or more 0s across both hands, as the maximum total digits is 16. Player 0 has been consistently bidding on 0s, which could indicate they have several, but 6 seems excessive. Challenging this bid is the best move as it seems improbable to meet the bid quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) challenges Player 0's (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bid of 6 0s.
