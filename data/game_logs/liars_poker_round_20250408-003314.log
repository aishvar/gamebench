Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make the first bid. I have two 0s in my hand (from the number 27198045). I can start with a bid of 2 0s, which is a reasonable opening bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 0s. Since I don't have any 0s, I'm unsure if Player 0 has enough to make their bid valid. However, I can make a higher bid using my 8s. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable move as it increases the quantity, and there's a good chance the total could meet this bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 8s. Since I can see that I have at least one 8, I can confidently raise the bid. I will bid 4 8s, which is a valid higher bid by increasing the quantity while keeping the same digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 8s. Since I have two, Player 0 must have at least two, making the total at least four. Challenging would result in a loss because the total is at least four. Therefore, I will bid 5 8s, hoping the total is five or more.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, and the current bid is 5 8s. Since I know there are at least 5 8s based on my own card, I can safely increase the bid. I will bid 6 8s, which is a valid higher bid than the current one.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and the current bid is 6 8s. Considering the bidding history, Player 0 has been consistently increasing the bid on 8s, suggesting confidence. The total number of 8s must be at least 6, requiring Player 0 to have four. Bidding 7 8s is risky but possible if they have five or more. Given the pattern, I'll bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand (the digits 27198045) and the current bid is 7 8s. Since I have enough 8s to support a higher bid, I can bid 8 8s, which is a valid higher bid. This also keeps the same digit while increasing the quantity, making it a strong move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and the current bid is 8 8s. Considering the total possible 8s, if Player 0 has six, the total would be exactly 8. However, it's uncertain if Player 0 has that many. Challenging is a strategic move to test if the bid is plausible.
