Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can bid anything as long as the quantity is at least 1 and the digit is between 0 and 9. I have one 4, one 5, two 6s, one 7, one 8, and one 9 in my hand. Bidding 1 9s is a reasonable first bid, as it's a higher digit and I have one in my hand. It's not overly aggressive, but establishes a starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one '9', so I already know that the current bid of '1 9s' is valid. Given that there are 16 digits in total and the current bid is very low, it is safe to increase the bid slightly. Additionally, I have two '1's, making it reasonable to bid on '1's. Therefore, I will bid '2 1s', which is higher than '1 9s' in quantity, making it a safe incremental bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. Bidding 3 1s would be risky as it relies entirely on my opponent having at least two 1s. Instead, I will bid 3 4s. I have two 4s in my hand, and it's a reasonable increase from the current bid, increasing the quantity while staying within plausible limits. It's also a digit I have some representation of, making the bid less of a complete bluff.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 81361947, which contains exactly one '4'. The current bid is 3 '4's. Given that each player has 8 digits, there are 16 digits in total. I have only one '4', meaning Player 0 would need at least two '4's in their hand alone to justify their bid. Although this is possible, the jump from '2 1s' to '3 4s' seems aggressive, potentially indicating a bluff. However, since having two '4's in their hand isn't unlikely, challenging immediately might be risky. A safer move would be to increase the bid slightly with a digit I have multiple of. I have two '1's, making a bid of '3 6s' or '3 7s' risky since I only have one each. Instead, bidding '3 9s' or '3 8s' would also be risky as I have only one '8' and no '9'. Given this, I prefer to cautiously increase the bid to '3 6s', as I have one '6', and it's plausible Player 0 also has at least two '6's or the bid could provoke a challenge from them, which I can handle.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable increase, as it's a higher quantity of the same digit. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have two 4s, two 7s, and one 8, 9, 5. Bidding 4 7s is also possible. Considering the previous bids, 3 6s seems a bit high. I'll challenge it, as it's unlikely there are three 6s given the limited number of cards and the previous bids.
