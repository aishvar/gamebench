Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open with an initial bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s and two 8s, which are my strongest counts. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 8s, reflecting my own hand and leaving room for future bidding.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. My hand has one 8. Considering the maximum possible total is 16, 2 8s seems plausible. I'll bid higher by increasing the digit to 9s, as I have no 9s, making it harder for the opponent to call.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s and zero 9s. The current bid is 2 9s, which would require my opponent to have at least two 9s or for there to be a combined total of two 9s across both hands. Since I have none, the entire count relies on my opponent. The probability they have two or more 9s in their 8 digits is relatively low (~14%). Therefore, challenging the bid is strategically favorable.
