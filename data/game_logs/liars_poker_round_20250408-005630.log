Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, which is the highest frequency of any digit in my hand. Bidding 2 7s is a reasonable starting point, as it's the highest quantity I can confidently claim based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7 (the first digit). The current bid is 2 7s, which is reasonable since I know of at least one 7, so there could easily be one or two more in the opponent's hand. Since I must bid higher or challenge, and 2 7s is plausible, challenging now is risky. To increase the bid, I can raise the quantity to 3 while keeping the digit the same, making the new bid 3 7s. This is a safe incremental bid since three 7s across 16 digits is quite plausible.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 7s. Since there are only 16 digits in total and I already have two 7s, it's unlikely there's a third 7 in the other player's hand. Bidding higher on 7s is risky, so I should challenge to verify the current bid.
