Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 5s, one 0, and no other repeated digits. Bidding 2 5s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player might have at least one 5, making the total count of 5s at least 3, but I'll start conservatively.

Calculating action for Player 1 (Naive 50/50)
Player 1 (Naive) chose to BID: 2 6s
Player 1 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 6s. Since I cannot increase the quantity of 6s based on my hand, I should consider challenging the bid. It's unlikely that Player 1 has 2 6s, given the limited number of digits in play.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) challenges Player 1's (Naive 50/50) bid of 2 6s.
