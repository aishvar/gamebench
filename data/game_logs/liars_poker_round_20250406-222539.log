Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand, so I know for certain that there are at least three 3s in total. With no current bid, an opening bid of '3 3s' is a safe and credible move that leverages my strength in 3s while leaving flexibility for future bids.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3

--- Turn: Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains no 0s, and the current bid of '4 0s' forces all four 0s to appear in the opponent's 8 digitsâ€”a highly improbable event. Since the likelihood of there being four 0s among 8 random digits is extremely low, challenging the bid is the best strategic move.
