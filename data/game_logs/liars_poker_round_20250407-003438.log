Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s and two 0s, which are the most frequent digits. Bidding 2 6s seems reasonable as a starting point, as it's likely that the other player might also have at least one 6, making the total count of 6s at least 3.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding 3 6s is a valid option, but I'm unsure if there are enough 6s in total. Bidding 2 7s is also valid, and I have no 7s, making it a reasonable bluff. Bidding 3 7s is also valid, but I have no 7s. Given the low initial bid, challenging seems risky as the bidder might actually have a 6. I will bid 3 6s, hoping to push the opponent and gather information. This is a slightly aggressive but plausible bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which matches my count. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I can't increase the quantity of 6s beyond 3, I'll bid 3 7s, as I have two 7s and it's a higher digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding 4 7s is possible, but risky. Bidding on a different digit seems safer. I have two 2s, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 8 and one 0. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable increase, as I have one 8 and it's a higher digit than 7. I'm choosing to bid 4 8s because it's a relatively safe bid given my hand and the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 8s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and I have none, it's highly unlikely there are 4 or more 8s in play. I should challenge the bid.
