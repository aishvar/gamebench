Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is 1 0s and I possess one 0 myself, it's very likely that at least one exists in total, making the bid safe. To increase the bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I also have three 8s in my hand, which suggests that a bid involving 8s is promising. Therefore, I will raise the bid to 3 8s, which is a higher quantity and a higher digit, leveraging my strong count of 8s.

Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 9s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I see two 9s and three 8s. The current bid is 3 9s. Since I already hold two 9s, Player 0 only needs to have one 9 for their bid to be valid, which is quite plausible. Challenging now is risky. To outbid, I can increase the quantity or bid the same quantity on a higher digit, but 9 is the highest digit. Therefore, the only valid next bid is 4 of any digit. Given my three 8s, bidding 4 8s is a reasonable and safe escalation.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 4 9s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s. The current bid is 4 9s, which requires there to be at least two more 9s in Player 0's hand. Given the total of 16 digits and typical distribution, it's somewhat risky but plausible. However, since I only have two 9s, and Player 0 is a naive bidder who might be bluffing or overestimating, challenging here is reasonable because the probability Player 0 has two or more 9s is low enough to justify calling the bluff.
