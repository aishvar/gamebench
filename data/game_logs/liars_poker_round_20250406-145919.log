Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can start with any valid bid. I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 3 3s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that other players have at least one 3.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my hand is 16407576, I have one 6 and one 7. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and there are only 3 players, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. I will bid 4 3s or higher if I have a good chance of having a higher digit or quantity. However, I should also consider the possibility of others having multiple 3s or higher digits. A safe bet would be to increase the quantity or digit slightly. I have one 3, so bidding 4 3s might not be the best as it could be risky if others have multiple 3s. I will bid 4 6s as it seems reasonable and challenging to verify.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6. Given 24 total digits in play and the current bid of 4 6s, it would require at least 3 more 6s among the other two players' 16 digits. Statistically, this is plausible, but not guaranteed. Since the bid is not overly aggressive and within a reasonable range, challenging now carries risk. Instead, I will make a safe incremental raise by bidding 4 7s, which is the minimal legal higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This keeps pressure on opponents without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. While I don't have any 8s or 9s, I can reasonably assume that at least one other player has a 7, making the bid of 4 7s plausible. However, bidding 5 7s seems risky without more information. Since the bid history shows incremental increases, I should challenge the bid to gather more information about the distribution of digits among the players.
