Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 5s, two 0s, one 6, one 3, and one 8. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, as I already hold two 5s myself, making this bid safe and forcing the opponent to either raise or challenge a likely true bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. I have two 7s. Bidding 3 7s is a reasonable move, increasing the quantity and the digit. It's a plausible bid given my hand and doesn't immediately seem like a bluff. Bidding higher than 3 7s might be too risky without knowing the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 15681305, I have no 7s, which makes the current bid of 3 7s somewhat risky. Given there are 16 digits total, for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need at least 3 7s between both hands. Since I hold none, the opponent would need all 3 or more, which is unlikely. Therefore, challenging is the best move here.
