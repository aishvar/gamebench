Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, two 3s, one 5, one 6, one 8, and one 9. A safe and informative opening bid is '2 3s', leveraging my two 3s to start with a modest but credible bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (44804577), I don't have any 3s. The opponent has bid '2 3s', which means they're claiming there are at least 2 threes between both our hands. Since I have zero 3s, this means all of those 3s would have to be in their hand. They could have 2 or more 3s, making their bid valid. However, I can make a higher bid based on what I know about my own hand. I have two 4s, one 8, one 0, one 5, and two 7s. I could bid '3 4s' (claiming there are at least 3 fours total), but that would be risky since I only have 2 fours myself. A safer bid would be '2 4s' (same quantity but higher digit than the current bid), which I know is true based on my hand alone. Even safer would be '2 5s', '2 7s', or '2 8s', all of which I can support partially from my hand. I'll go with '2 7s' since I have two 7s in my hand, making this a very safe bid while still advancing the game.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 6, 0, 3, 3, 1, 5, 9, 8. I have no 7s, so the current bid of 2 7s relies entirely on my opponent's hand. It is quite plausible that my opponent has 2 or more 7s, making a challenge risky at this stage. To make a safe higher bid, I look at digits I have multiples of. I have two 3s, so a natural and safe next bid is 2 8s or 3 3s. Since I have one 8, bidding 2 8s is only matching the quantity, but bidding 3 3s increases the quantity and is supported by my hand. Therefore, I will bid 3 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current game state. I have the hand 44804577, which contains no 3s. The current bid is '3 3s', meaning Player 0 claims there are at least 3 threes in total between our hands. Since I have no 3s in my hand, all 3 would need to be in Player 0's hand. While this is possible, it would mean Player 0 has a high concentration of 3s (3 out of their 8 digits). My options are to challenge or make a higher bid. For a higher bid, I could bid '4 3s' (increasing quantity), or '3 4s' or higher (same quantity, higher digit). Since I have two 4s, two 7s, and one 5 in my hand, bidding '3 4s' seems reasonable as I already have 2 of them. Even if Player 0 has only 1 more four, the bid would be valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (60331598), I have the digits: 6, 0, 3, 3, 1, 5, 9, 8. I have zero 4s, so the current bid of 3 4s relies entirely on Player 1 having at least 3 or more 4s. This is somewhat unlikely given typical digit distribution in 8 digits. Since I have no 4s, and 3 is a moderate quantity, it's a reasonable point to challenge. The probability that Player 1 alone has 3 or more 4s out of 8 digits is low, making challenge the best move.
