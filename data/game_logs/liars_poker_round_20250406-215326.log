Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (72878943), I have: one 2, one 3, one 4, one 7 (twice), one 8 (twice), and one 9. Since I have two 7s and two 8s, these are good candidates for my bid. I could bid conservatively with just what I know I have, or estimate what might be in my opponent's hand. Since there are 16 total digits in play (8 in my hand, 8 in my opponent's hand), and assuming a roughly even distribution, each digit would appear about 1.6 times on average. My opponent likely has at least one 7 or one 8, so bidding 3 of either would be reasonable. I'll bid 3 7s since I already have two 7s in my hand, making it a relatively safe opening bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 7s. Since I have enough 7s to support a higher bid, I can confidently bid 4 7s, which is a valid higher bid both in quantity and the same digit.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '4 7s'. Looking at my hand (72878943), I have exactly one 7. The opponent has bid that there are at least 4 sevens between our hands. Since I only have 1 seven, that means the opponent would need to have at least 3 sevens in their hand for their bid to be valid. While it's possible they have 3 or more sevens, it's somewhat unlikely for a single digit to appear that frequently in a random 8-digit hand. The probability of having 3+ of the same digit in 8 random digits is relatively low. I think it's more likely they're bluffing, so I'll challenge.
