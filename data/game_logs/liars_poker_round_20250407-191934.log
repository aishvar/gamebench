--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 23560754, the digit '5' appears twice, and '0' appears once. The most common digits in my hand are '5' (2 times), followed by '2', '3', '6', '0', '7', and '4' (each appearing once). Starting with a conservative bid on a digit I hold multiple times is generally a good opening strategy. Therefore, I will bid 2 fives (2 5s), as I know at least two exist and there may be more in the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one '5' (from 43159268). Given that the current bid is '2 5s' and there are two players, it's possible that the opponent has at least one more '5' to make the bid valid. However, since the bid is already at the minimum for two players, I can either bid higher (e.g., '3 5s' or bid on a higher digit) or challenge. Given the risk of the opponent having exactly one '5', challenging is a reasonable option.
