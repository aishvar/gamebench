--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there has been no bid yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, one 8, two 5s, one 6, one 0, and one 4. The most common digits in my hand are 2 and 5, each appearing twice. Typically, starting with a conservative but credible opening bid is strategic. Bidding '2 2s' or '2 5s' would be reasonable, but since 2 is slightly lower and often slightly safer, I'll choose to open with '2 2s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 2s in my hand. The maximum possible number of 2s across both hands is 8. Since the current bid is 2 2s, it is likely that the opponent is bluffing. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
