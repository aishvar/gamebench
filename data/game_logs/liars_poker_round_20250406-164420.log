--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. As the opening bid, starting with 2 7s is safe because even if the opponent has zero 7s, the total meets the bid. This establishes a base while leveraging my strong 7s and higher digit value.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 7s, so the current bid of 2 7s depends entirely on Player 0's hand. Since it's quite reasonable for one player to have two 7s out of eight digits, challenging now would be risky. To make a safe higher bid, I look at my hand: I have two 5s. Counting potential 5s in Player 0's hand, a bid of 3 5s is plausible and strictly higher than 2 7s (same quantity, higher digit). Therefore, I will bid 3 5s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand. The opponent bid 3 5s after my 2 7s. Given there are only 8 unknown digits (their hand), the probability of them holding exactly 3+ 5s is relatively low. Since 5s are less common in my hand and the bid requires them to carry most of the count, challenging seems favorable here.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) challenges Player 1's (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bid of 3 5s.
