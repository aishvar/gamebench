Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the opening move with no prior bids. My hand contains two 0s, two 1s, one 3, one 4, one 5, and one additional 0 or 1. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 0s, reflecting the two 0s I hold. This sets a conservative baseline while not overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s (digits: 0,5,3,4,1,0,0,1). The current bid is 2 1s, and I can see two 1s as well. Since I hold two 1s myself, it's very likely there are more 1s in total, so challenging now would be risky. A safe strategic move is to increase the bid slightly. I can raise to 3 1s, which is plausible given my two 1s and the chance my opponent has at least one more.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 05341001, I have three 0s, two 1s, one 3, one 4, and one 5. The current bid is 3 2s. Since I have zero 2s, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least 3 2s, which is unlikely with only 8 digits. Given that, challenging is a strong move. Alternatively, I could outbid with 3 3s or 4 0s. Since I have 3 0s myself, bidding 4 0s would require the opponent to have at least 1 zero, which is plausible but riskier. Given the unlikelihood of 3 2s total, challenging is the best choice.
