Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make a valid bid. Bidding 2 9s seems reasonable as I can guarantee at least that count from my hand.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s, but I hold three 0s in my hand (from 35000742), guaranteeing that there are at least three 0s in play. By bidding 3 0s, I not only make a valid higher bid because the quantity increases from 2 to 3, but I also leverage a strong part of my hand. This minimizes risk compared to challenging the bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, which means there are at least 2 9s present. The current bid is 3 0s, which seems low given that I have two high digits. I can increase the bid to 4 9s, which is a valid higher bid based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, so the opponent must have all four 9s in their 8-digit hand, which is extremely unlikely (roughly a 0.5% chance). The bidding history also shows an unusual jump from my bid of 3 0s to a bid of 4 9s by the other player, suggesting a bluff. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
