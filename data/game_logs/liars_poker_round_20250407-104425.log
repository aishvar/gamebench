Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s and two 8s, which are strong candidates to bid on. Opening with a conservative yet solid bid, I will choose 3 5s, as it is likely there is at least one more 5 in the opponent's hand, making the bid plausible.
