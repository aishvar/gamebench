Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 45316025, I have two 0s, two 5s, two 3s, one 1, one 4, and one 6. A safe opening bid is to select a digit I have multiple of, such as 5 or 0. I will bid '2 5s' as a conservative but reasonable opening bid, reflecting my two 5s and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (39464776), I have zero 5s. The current bid is 2 5s, which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 2 fives between both our hands. Since I have zero 5s in my hand, this means Player 0 must have at least 2 fives in their hand for this bid to be valid. This is entirely possible, so challenging might be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid based on what I know about my own hand. I have two 7s and two 4s, one 6, one 9, one 3. I could bid 3 7s, but that would be risky since I only have two 7s and would need Player 0 to have at least one more. A safer bid would be to simply increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, such as '2 6s' or '2 7s'. Since I have two 7s in my hand, bidding '2 7s' is guaranteed to be valid and is higher than the current bid of '2 5s'.

Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 45316025, which contains 0 sevens. The current bid is 2 7s, meaning there must be at least two sevens out of the 16 digits total. Since I hold none, all two or more 7s would have to come from the opponent's hand. While it's possible they have two or more sevens, it's unlikely. However, since the current bid is only 2 7s, challenging now is risky because two sevens in their hand is plausible. Instead, I will make a minimal valid raise by increasing the digit at the same quantity from 2 7s to 2 8s, which is a safe incremental bid.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (39464776), I have two 7s but no 8s. The current bid is '2 8s'. I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Since each player has 8 digits, there are 16 total digits in play. The opponent has bid that there are at least 2 eights total. Since I have zero 8s in my hand, all of those would need to be in the opponent's hand. While it's possible they have 2 or more 8s, I can make a strategic higher bid. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding '2 9s' would be safe and higher than the current bid (same quantity but higher digit). This is a conservative but safe play based on what I know I have.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 9S'
Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 45316025, I have no 9s, so the current bid of 2 9s relies entirely on the opponent having both 9s, which is somewhat unlikely but plausible. However, I have two 5s and one 0, making it safer to increase the bid on digits I hold. Since the current bid is 2 9s, I can overbid with 3 5s, given my two 5s plus a reasonable chance the opponent has at least one 5.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (39464776), I don't have any 5s. The current bid is 3 5s, which means the opponent is claiming there are at least 3 fives between our hands. Since I have zero 5s, all 3 would need to be in the opponent's hand. This is possible, but not certain. I have two 7s in my hand, so I could bid 3 7s, which would be higher than 3 5s (same quantity, higher digit). This seems like a reasonable move since I know for certain there are at least 2 sevens (in my hand), and there's a decent chance the opponent has at least one 7 as well.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 45316025, I have the following digit counts: 0s=1, 1s=1, 2s=1, 3s=1, 4s=1, 5s=2, 6s=1, 7s=0, 8s=0, 9s=0. The current bid is 3 7s, but I have zero 7s, so the opponent is betting on at least 3 total 7s. Given that I hold none, it would require the opponent to have all 3 or more, which is unlikely in their 8 digits. Since the probability of them holding 3 or more 7s is low, challenging here is the best move.
