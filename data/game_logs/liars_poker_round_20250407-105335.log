Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 1s. I'll bid three 1s to start.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have many 1s, I'll look at other digits. I have digits 1, 9, 4, 2, 6, 5, 3, 8. I can see that there are a few higher digits than 1, and I can reasonably assume that the total count of a higher digit might be at least 3 or more across both hands. I'll bid 3 2s, keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I don't have any 2s in my hand. To play it safe, I will increase the quantity to 4 and bid 0s, as I have one 0 in my hand. This is a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I need to either challenge it or make a higher bid. My hand is 19426538, which contains one 0. The total count of 0s across both players is at least one (mine) plus the count in Player 0's hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since I have no information about Player 0's hand, I'll analyze the bid. Bidding 4 1s is a possible move as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit. However, I should also consider the likelihood of the current bid being true. Given that I have one 0, it's possible that Player 0 has three or more 0s, but it's not extremely likely. I'll take a cautious approach and bid 4 1s, increasing the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. I can raise the bid to 5 0s, 4 2s, 4 3s, 4 4s, 4 5s, 4 6s, 4 7s, 4 8s, or 4 9s. I will bid 4 2s. I have one 2 in my hand, so it's not completely unreasonable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have information about the other digits in the opponent's hand, I'll analyze my hand to make an informed decision. My hand is 19426538, which contains one 2, one 5, and other digits. I can bid higher than 4 2s by either bidding 5 2s or 4 3s. Bidding 4 3s seems reasonable as it increases the digit. However, I should check if I have at least one 3 to support this bid. My hand is 19426538, and it contains one 3 (in 38), so bidding 4 3s is plausible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. I could bid 4 4s, but I think it is safer to bid 5 0s, as the bid history shows 4 0s were bid previously.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. The bid history shows an escalating pattern between digits 0-3. Given that I have two 5s and one 6, bidding 5 5s seems like a reasonable increase in the digit while maintaining the same quantity. It's also a safer move than challenging or making a very high bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Bidding 6 0s is a safe increase in quantity and a reset of the digit, giving me a good chance of winning if the other player challenges. It's also unlikely that there are more than 5 fives in total.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. My hand is 19426538, which contains no 0s. The total count of 0s across both hands must be at least the count in Player 0's hand. Given that I have no 0s, it's possible Player 0 has multiple 0s, but bidding 7 0s might be too aggressive. However, I can bid a higher digit with the same quantity. Since the maximum quantity is 16 and there are 8 digits per player, bidding 6 1s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 6 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. Bidding 7 0s is a safe increment and moves the focus away from 1s, which my opponent seems to be pushing.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 7 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. I have the digits 19426538, which means I have no 0s. The total count of 0s must be in my opponent's hand. Since my opponent has 8 digits, it's possible they have 7 or more 0s, although it's a bit high. However, bidding higher on 0s is not feasible as it's already at 7. I can either bid a higher quantity on a different digit or the same quantity on a higher digit. I can bid 7 1s as I have one 1. Let's analyze: I have one 1, and my opponent likely has some 1s. The total count could be around 3-4, so bidding 7 1s is a bit aggressive but possible. However, it's better to challenge or make a more reasonable bid. I see that I have multiple 5s and 2s, and the last bid was 7 0s. Bidding 7 1s is still reasonable as it's a higher digit. I'll go with bidding 7 1s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. Bidding higher seems risky, as the total number of 1s needed is already quite high. It's more likely that the previous player is bluffing. Therefore, I will challenge.
