Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 0 in my hand (from 23120697), so it's likely there's at least one more 0 in the other player's hand. I can bid higher than 1 0s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 1 1s is a reasonable next step as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 6 and a 7, and there are other digits higher than 2, bidding 1 3s or higher seems reasonable. I'll choose to increase the digit to 3, as it's a conservative move and keeps the quantity low.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 4s. I have the digits 23120697 in my hand, which contains one 2 and no 4s. The presence of a 2 suggests that the count of 2s could be higher than 1. I can bid higher than 1 4s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 1 5s is a valid move as it increases the digit. However, considering my hand has a 6, I could also consider bidding on 6s. But since the current bid is low (1 4s), a more strategic move would be to bid on a digit that is relatively high but still plausible. Bidding 2 6s seems too high given the current bid and my limited knowledge of the other player's hand. Thus, bidding 1 5s is a reasonable and safe next step.
