Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding with a reasonable opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, and one each of 1, 4, 3, 0, 8, and another 4. A common opening strategy is to bid on a digit I have multiple of. I have two 5s, so starting with '2 5s' is a safe and logical opening bid.
