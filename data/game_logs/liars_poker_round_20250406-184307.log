--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 3s, and one each of 5, 2, 0, and 8. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be '2 7s' since I already hold two 7s myself, making this bid certainly true and putting some pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 7s. Bidding 2 8s is a higher bid since 8 is a higher digit than 7. This is a safe move because I know I have two 8s, ensuring the total meets the bid.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8 and two 7s. The current bid is 2 8s, which is plausible since I know of one 8, and the opponent likely has at least one as well. A minimal safe raise would be to increase the quantity or the digit. Since the digit is already at 8, the only strictly higher bid is 3 of any digit. Given that I have two 7s, bidding 3 7s seems safer than bidding 3 8s, as I already contribute two 7s myself, and the opponent only needs one more 7 to make the bid plausible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s and no 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, which must come entirely from Player 0's hand. Given the uncertainty and the risk of Player 0 bluffing, challenging is a strategic choice.
