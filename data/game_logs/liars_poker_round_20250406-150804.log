Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 27709018, which contains two 7s, two 0s, one 9, one 1, and one 8, and one 2. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. I have two 7s and two 0s, which are the highest counts for any digit in my hand. Bidding on a digit I have more of seems safer. I'll start by bidding on 0s or 7s. Since 7 is higher than 0, I'll bid on 7s. A bid of 2 7s seems like a good starting point as it reflects the count in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7. The current bid is 2 7s, which is plausible since I hold one and the opponent likely has at least one as well. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the digit or the quantity. Since I don't see any 8s or 9s in my hand, increasing the digit at the same quantity is risky. Instead, I will bid 3 of a digit I have multiple of. I have two 3s, so bidding 3 3s is a reasonable progression, as it's likely there is at least one more 3 in the opponent's hand, making the total at least three.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one 3 in my hand (from 27709018), so it's possible there are 3 threes in total. However, I have two 7s and a 9, and no other high-frequency digits. I can bid higher than 3 3s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 3 7s is a reasonable move as it keeps the same quantity but increases the digit, and I have information about my own hand that supports the possibility of having more 7s.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, there is one 7. The current bid is 3 7s, which implies at least two 7s are in the other player's hand. Given the distribution, this is plausible but somewhat risky to challenge now. I have two 3s, so bidding 3 4s or 3 5s would not be a legal raise, but bidding 3 8s (higher digit with same quantity) is a minimal safe raise. I also have one 8, making this plausible. Alternatively, I could bid 4 of something, but without strong evidence, a minimal raise is safer.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (from 27709018), so it's possible there are three 8s in total. However, I also have two 7s and one 9 and other digits that could be relevant. Since I have a 9, I can bid higher than 8 by bidding the same quantity on a higher digit. Bidding 3 9s is a valid move as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This is a reasonable action given my hand and the current bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. Given there are 16 digits total, the current bid of 3 9s is plausible but somewhat aggressive. To outbid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, the only option is increasing quantity to 4 0s or any digit. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, so bidding 4 0s is risky. Alternatively, I have two 3s, so bidding 4 3s is reasonable, as it only requires two more 3s in the opponent's hand, which is plausible. Therefore, I will bid 4 3s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. My hand is 27709018, which contains one 3. So, the total count of 3s between our hands is at least one (mine) plus the count in Player 1's hand. Player 1 bid 4 3s, suggesting they have at least three 3s. It's possible but I should be cautious. I have two options: either challenge or make a higher bid. A higher bid could be 4 4s or 5 0s (or higher quantity with any digit). Since I have no information about Player 1's hand, I'll analyze my hand. My hand has a total of 2, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 1, 8. It has two 0s and two 7s. I can bid higher on 7s as I have two of them. Bidding 5 7s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and is based on my hand's information.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 58733264, I have one 7. The current bid is 5 7s, which means there would need to be at least four 7s in Player 0's hand. Given that the average expected count of any digit in 16 digits is about 1.6, having five or more 7s total is unlikely, especially since I only have one. The probability of the opponent having four or more 7s is quite low, making the current bid suspiciously high. Therefore, challenging seems the best move.
