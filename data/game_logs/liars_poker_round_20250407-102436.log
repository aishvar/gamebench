Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the likelihood that there is only one 0 across both hands is plausible. Since the current bid is minimal (1 0s), challenging it would be unwise because it's likely true or conservative. To continue the game strategically, I should raise the bid. I notice I have two 2s in my hand, so bidding 2 2s is a safe and strictly higher bid (higher quantity).

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 24127695, there is exactly one 3. The current bid is 2 3s, implying at least two 3s among both hands. Since I have one, the opponent needs to have at least one 3, which is quite plausible. Challenging now would be risky. To make a safe incremental raise, I can bid 2 4s, as I also have one 4, and the likelihood of the opponent having at least one 4 is similar. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 3 of a digit I have multiple of. I have two 2s, so bidding 3 2s is a reasonable and safe higher bid, leveraging my hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '24127695', I have zero 3s. The current bid is 3 3s, so for that to be true, the opponent must have all three 3s in their hand, which is unlikely given the distribution. Since there are only 16 digits total and I hold none of the bid digit, the probability of 3 or more 3s overall is low, making it a good opportunity to challenge.
