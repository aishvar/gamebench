Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 5, one 1, one 7, one 6, one 3, one 9, one 4, and one 3. With two 3s in my hand, that's a good starting point. Since there are no previous bids, I can make a conservative opening bid. Bidding '3 3s' is reasonable because I already have two 3s, and it's likely the opponent has at least one more 3 in their hand given the random distribution.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 42701569, containing a single '3'. The current bid is 3 '3's. Since I have one '3', only two additional '3's are needed in the opponent's hand of 8 digits to fulfill the bid. It's plausible that the opponent has at least two '3's. Therefore, challenging seems risky. To safely increase the bid, I can choose a digit I have multiple copies of or one that seems likely to appear frequently. However, I only have single copies of each digit. Still, digits like '4', '5', '6', or '9' might be common. I'll choose '4' as a digit to bid higher on, as it's a common digit and I already have one, making a total of 4 '4's plausible across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 4 (fourth digit). For the opponent's bid of '4 4s' to be true, they would need to have three 4s in their hand. While possible, this seems somewhat unlikely. Additionally, I can see all digits in play from 1-7 in my hand except for 2, plus a 9. Given the distribution and the early stage of the game, I think it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. Since I have one 5 in my hand, bidding '4 5s' is a reasonable next move - it maintains the same quantity but increases the digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. My hand is 42701569, which contains exactly one '5'. With 16 digits in total and only one '5' in my hand, Player 0 would need at least three '5s' for their bid to hold. Given they raised from 4 4s to 4 5s, it suggests they might have some '5s', but the jump is small. Still, since I have only one '5', it's plausible but risky. Rather than challenging, I can make a safer higher bid. My hand has two '4's, and the previous bid was 4 4s, indicating Player 0 likely has at least one '4'. Thus, bidding 5 4s seems safer and plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. For the opponent's bid of '5 4s' to be true, they would need to have four 4s in their hand. While possible, this seems unlikely given they waited to bid on 4s. Additionally, they raised the quantity rather than just bidding a higher digit. Based on the bidding pattern and my hand, I think they're bluffing.
