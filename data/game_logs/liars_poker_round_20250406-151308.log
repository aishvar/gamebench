Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid, I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (98870258), I have two 8s. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative yet informative. Bidding '2 8s' reflects my hand and is a relatively safe starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 8s. Since the current bid is only 2 8s, it's quite plausible the opponent has two 8s or there is one 8 in their hand and one in mine (which is not the case). Given the total of 16 digits, 2 occurrences of any digit is very reasonable. Therefore, challenging now is risky. The safest move is to make a minimal higher bid. I will increase the quantity to 2 but choose a higher digit, 9, since I have one 9 in my hand, making it plausible there are at least 2 9s in total.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, so the total count of 9s is at least 1. The bid of 2 9s is possible but seems a bit high given that I have only one 9. However, it's still within a reasonable range considering there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have multiple 8s, I can consider bidding on a higher quantity of 8s or the same quantity of a higher digit. Bidding 3 8s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (04716591), I have zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, which would require all three 8s to be in the opponent's hand, an unlikely scenario. Since I have zero 8s, and the total maximum is 16 digits, the probability Player 0 holds 3 or more 8s is low. Therefore, challenging is the best strategic move.
