Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s. Bidding 2 4s is a safe and reasonable starting point, as it's based on the actual count in my hand and sets a baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 5s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have two 5s, increasing the quantity to 3 5s is not possible without risking a challenge. Instead, I can increase the digit to 6, as I have one 6 in my hand, and bid 3 6s, which is a higher bid than the current 2 5s.
