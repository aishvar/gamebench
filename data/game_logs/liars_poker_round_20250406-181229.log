Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: With the current bid being 3 0s, I should aim to increase the quantity or digit. I have 0s in my hand, but not many, so I should focus on increasing the digit. Since 0s are already bid, I should consider the next lowest digit, which is 1. However, I don't have any 1s in my hand. The next lowest digit is 2, but I also don't have any 2s in my hand. Moving on, I have one 3 in my hand, but I should aim higher than 3 0s. Considering my hand, I should bid 3 4s, increasing the digit to 4, which is higher than 0.
