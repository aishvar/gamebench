--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 8s, and one each of 0, 1, 7, 5, and 6. Starting with a conservative but credible opening bid, I will choose 3 8s, as I already hold two 8s, making it likely there is at least one more between both hands.

Calculating action for Player 1 (Naive 50/50)
Player 1 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 9s
Player 1 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. Since the total digits are 16, for the current bid of 3 9s to be valid, there must be at least two more 9s in Player 1's hand. Given the rarity of 9s and that I only hold one, it's somewhat unlikely Player 1 has two or more 9s. Therefore, challenging here is strategically sound, as the probability of the bid being false is reasonably high.
