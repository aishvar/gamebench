Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 00012539, which has three 0s. A reasonable starting bid could be based on my own hand, considering the total number of digits across all players is 24. I have 3 zeros, so it's likely there's at least one more zero in the other players' hands. Bidding 4 0s seems like a conservative and reasonable start.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand. The current bid is 4 0s, which seems high given that I have none. However, there are two other players who could have 0s. Since the bid is relatively low (4), I'll make a conservative higher bid to keep the game going.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have zero 0s in my hand. It's unlikely that there are five 0s total across all three players. While I could bid higher, challenging seems like the most strategic move given my hand and the previous bids. Bidding would be risky without knowing the other players' hands, and the current bid already seems high.
