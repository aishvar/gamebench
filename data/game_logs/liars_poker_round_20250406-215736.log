Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, making it likely that there is at least one 0 in total. However, bidding 2 0s is not a significant increase. Instead, I should consider challenging if I think the bid is unlikely, or make a more substantial bid. I have one 8 in my hand, so bidding 3 8s is a reasonable move, increasing both the quantity and the digit.
