Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without worrying about being too high. I have multiple digits that could potentially be used for a low quantity bid. Noticing that I have three 9s, I can start with a low quantity bid to test the waters.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (07340880), I have no 9s. Since there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's, the total number of 9s is solely dependent on the opponent. The current bid is 3 9s, which would require the opponent to have all 3 or more 9s in their hand. Statistically, that's unlikely, as the expected count of any digit per hand is less than 1. Therefore, it's a good opportunity to challenge this bid.
