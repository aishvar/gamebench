Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. My hand contains the digits 9, 8, 9, 0, 9, 4, 7, 7. Counting my digits, I have three 9s, one 8, one 0, two 7s, and one 4. The strongest opening bid is usually based on the digit I have the most of, which is three 9s. It is reasonable to assume there could be at least four 9s total across both hands, but opening with a conservative bid of three 9s is safe and puts pressure on the opponent to raise or challenge. Therefore, I will start the bidding with 3 nines.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (36374112), I have 0 nines. The current bid is '3 9s', meaning the opponent claims there are at least 3 nines total between our hands. Since I have 0 nines, that means the opponent would need to have at least 3 nines in their hand of 8 digits. The probability of having exactly 3 nines in 8 random digits is about 10.7%, and the probability of having 4 or more is about 3.7%. So there's roughly a 14.4% chance they have 3 or more nines, which is relatively low. Given this is the first bid and they chose a relatively high quantity for a high digit, I think challenging is the better option.
