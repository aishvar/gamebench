Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid and I have two 8s in my hand, I can make a reasonable opening bid. Starting with 3 8s is a safe choice, as it accounts for the possibility of at least one more 8 in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. The current bid is 3 8s, which would require my opponent to have at least two 8s to make the bid truthful. Given that each player has 8 digits, it's plausible but not guaranteed. Statistically, since each digit has a 1/10 chance, the expected total number of 8s is about 3.2, making the bid reasonable. Since it's early in the bidding and the bid is not outrageous, I will raise conservatively by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, choosing 3 9s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. Looking at my hand, I have no 9s, which makes it unlikely for there to be 3 or more 9s across both hands unless Player 1 has a significant number of them. However, there is still room for doubt as Player 1 might have multiple 9s. Instead of challenging, I will raise the bid by increasing the quantity to 4 and choosing a digit that I have more of in my hand, such as 0. I have two 0s, so it's plausible that there are at least 4 0s in total between both hands.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 6, 1, 8, 5, 7, 7, 3, 4 with no zeroes at all. The current bid is 4 zeroes, which requires that the opponent holds at least 4 zeroes, since I have none. Given there are only 8 digits in their hand, having 4 or more zeroes is possible but unlikely (binomial probability of 4+ zeroes in 8 digits with 1/10 chance per digit is low). Therefore, the bid of 4 zeroes is risky and probably a bluff, so the best move is to challenge.
