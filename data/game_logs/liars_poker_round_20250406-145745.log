Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains the digits 6, 3, 3, 1, 8, 4, 0, 4. I see that I have two 6s and two 4s and one 8 and one 3 and one 1. A reasonable starting bid could be 2 6s or 2 4s given that I have two of these digits. However, I should also consider that higher digits and quantities are more risky but could be beneficial if others have lower digits. Given that I have two 6s and it's a high digit, I'll start with a conservative bid that could potentially be valid and not too high to scare others.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 6s, but several 2s and 3s. The current bid is 2 6s, which is plausible given 24 digits in total. Since I cannot challenge my own bid and it's the first bid, I should either challenge now or make a higher bid. It's early in the game, so challenging now is risky and unlikely to succeed. Instead, I will increase the bid to 2 7s, which is a minimal safe raise, advancing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s. Since I have two 9s, I can reasonably bid 3 9s, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that this bid can be beaten. My hand contains the digits 6, 3, 3, 1, 8, 4, 0, 4. I have no 9s, but I do have multiple high digits. The bid of 3 9s seems high but I have to consider if there's a possibility that the other players have multiple 9s. Given that I have no 9s and it's unlikely that between the other two players they have 3 or more 9s, I should consider a challenge or a strategic bid. However, I also need to think about the potential for other players to have multiple 9s. Since I don't have any 9s, my best course of action seems to be challenging, as I highly doubt there are 3 or more 9s in total.
