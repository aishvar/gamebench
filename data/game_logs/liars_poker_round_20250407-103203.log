Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (36056515), I have zero 0s. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, it's quite plausible that Player 0 has at least one 0, so challenging now would likely lose. To increase the bid, the minimal higher bid is 1 1s. I have three 1s in my hand, so bidding 3 1s is a safe and strong increase, leveraging my hand strength.
