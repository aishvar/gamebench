Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 93275856. I have two 5s, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. With 16 total digits in play (8 for me, 8 for the opponent), the expected average count for any digit is 1.6. Having two 5s gives me a good starting point. A bid of '3 5s' is a reasonable opening bid. It suggests I believe there's at least one 5 in the opponent's hand, which is statistically plausible, without being overly aggressive for the first bid.
