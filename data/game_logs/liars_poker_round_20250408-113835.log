Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have a 4 in my hand. Since my hand contains the digit 4, I should bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. I'll bid 4 6s, increasing the quantity and digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
