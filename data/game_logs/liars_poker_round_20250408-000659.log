Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. Since I'm the first to bid, starting with 1 9s is a safe move because even if the opponent has one, the total is 2, which still satisfies the bid. It's also the highest digit, making it harder for the opponent to raise on the same digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, and there are 16 total digits in play. It is highly likely that there is at least one more 9 in Player 0's hand, making a challenge too risky at this point. To increase the bid, I will choose the next logical step, which is 2 9s, as it is a reasonable progression based on my hand and the game state.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 9s. Since I don't have any 9s, the total can't exceed the number Player 1 has. Challenging is a good move because if Player 1 has only one 9, the bid is invalid, and I win. Given the uncertainty and my hand's composition, challenging is the optimal choice.
