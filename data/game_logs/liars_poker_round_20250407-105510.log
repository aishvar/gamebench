Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening bid and there is no current bid, I want to start with a reasonable, non-revealing bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s and two 1s, so bidding 2 6s is a safe and truthful opening bid that does not overcommit.
