Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 8s, one 1, one 3, one 7, and one 9. The best initial bid should be conservative yet based on my strongest digits. I have two 0s and two 8s, so starting with '2 8s' is reasonable, as it leverages my known digits and doesn't overcommit early.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 28517244, I have two 8s and other digits as well. I can see if I increase the quantity or the digit, I might have a chance. The current bid is 2 8s, so I should bid at least 3 or higher digit with a similar or higher quantity. I have two 8s, so challenging seems risky without calculating probabilities. I will increase the quantity and bid 3 8s or higher if possible.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, so for that to be valid, my opponent would need to have at least one 8. Given that, a bid of 3 8s is plausible. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or the digit. Since 8 is already a high digit, the next higher bid could be 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, so it's plausible my opponent has at least two 9s, but less likely than 8s. Alternatively, I can bid 4 8s, which assumes there are at least two 8s in my opponent's hand, which is possible but less likely. However, raising to 4 8s puts pressure on my opponent and is a reasonable strategic move given my two 8s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 4 8s in total. Given that I have no 8s in my hand (28517244), and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I should consider if it's plausible for the other player to have 4 or more 8s. Since I have no 8s, I will challenge the bid as it seems highly unlikely.
