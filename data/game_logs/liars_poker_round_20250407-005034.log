Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 78464528, I have one 8, one 7, one 6, one 5, two 4s, one 2, and no 0s, 1s, 3s, or 9s. Since this is the opening bid and I have two 4s in my hand, starting with a moderate bid of '3 4s' is reasonable. This leaves room for higher bids while being fairly likely given I already have two 4s and only need one more from the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 25231906, I have zero 4s. The current bid is 3 4s, meaning there must be at least three 4s across both hands. Since I have none, all three (or more) would have to be in Player 0's hand, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. The probability of them having 3 or more 4s is low, so challenging is the optimal move.
