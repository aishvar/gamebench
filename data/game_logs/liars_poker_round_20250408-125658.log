Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: With no bids yet, I can make a bid with any quantity and digit. I have a 7 in my hand. Bidding 1 7s seems like a reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is very low at '1 7s', and though my hand (82934534) does not contain any 7s, it is still highly probable that at least one 8 exists given I have one 8 myself. A modest increase in digit would be safe and reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 1 8s, which is the minimum quantity and digit. I can make a valid higher bid by increasing the quantity or digit. Since I have one 8, I can make a bid with a higher quantity of 8s or a higher digit. However, I don't have any digits higher than 8. Therefore, I will bid a higher quantity of 8s.

Player 0 bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '8' in my hand. The current bid is 2 '8s', meaning the other player claims there is at least one more '8'. With 16 digits total, it's entirely plausible that at least one additional '8' exists in the other player's hand. Therefore, challenging now would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have two '3s' and two '4s' in my hand, making these digits safer to bid on. I'll bid '3 3s', as I already have two, requiring only one from the opponent's hand, which is quite plausible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 3S'
Player 1 bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which is a high digit. The current bid is only 3 3s. I see an opportunity to increase the digit and quantity based on my hand, making a bid of 4 8s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 82934534, which contains only one '8'. The opponent jumped the bid from '2 8s' to '4 8s', indicating they likely have multiple '8s'. However, given that I only have one '8', for their bid of '4 8s' to be valid, they must have at least three '8s' themselves. While possible, this is somewhat risky. However, since each player has eight digits, it's not improbable for them to hold three '8s'. Given this uncertainty, challenging may be risky. Instead, I will make a safer incremental bid. My hand contains three '3s', making the digit '3' safer for me to bid on. The current bid is '4 8s'; I can bid '5 3s', relying on my three '3s' and hoping the opponent has at least two more.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 3S'
Player 1 bids: 5 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 5 3s. Bidding 5 8s is a reasonable move as it increases both quantity and digit based on my hand. However, I should challenge the current bid as it seems unlikely considering the maximum possible quantity of 16 for any digit.
