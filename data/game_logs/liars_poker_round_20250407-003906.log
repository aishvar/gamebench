Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 6s and two 8s, which are the highest frequency digits in my hand. Bidding 2 8s seems reasonable as it's a safe starting point, allowing room for higher bids while being likely to be true given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have the digits 5,7,3,1,7,1,8,3 in my hand. Looking at my hand, I have one 8. The current bid is '2 8s'. Since there are 16 total digits in the game (8 for each player), and I have one 8 in my hand, it's entirely possible that Player 0 has at least one 8 as well, making the current bid of '2 8s' valid. I could challenge, but it seems risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I notice I have two 7s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 7s. I could bid '3 7s', which would be higher than '2 8s' because of the increased quantity, even though the digit is lower. This seems like a reasonable bid that has a good chance of being true based on my hand.

Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, which means there are at least three 7s in total (including the opponent's hand). The current bid is 3 7s, so I can either bid higher or challenge. Since I know there are at least three 7s, challenging is not a good option. I can safely increase the bid to 4 7s, as it's a higher quantity with the same digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (57317183), I have only one 7. The current bid is '4 7s', claiming there are at least 4 sevens between both players' hands. Since I only have one 7, that means my opponent would need to have at least 3 sevens in their hand for this bid to be true. While it's possible they have 3 sevens, it seems somewhat unlikely given the distribution of digits. My opponent started with '2 8s' (I have two 8s, so this was a safe bid), then I bid '3 7s' (which was reasonable given I had one 7), but now they've pushed to '4 7s'. This suggests they might have multiple 7s, but having exactly 3 would be somewhat unusual. I think challenging is slightly better than making a higher bid with uncertain information.
