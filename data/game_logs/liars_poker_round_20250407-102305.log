Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 8s. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid that is guaranteed to be true. Bidding 2 8s ensures the total is at least 2 (my two 8s plus any from the opponent). This is a safe opening move, forcing the opponent to bid higher.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (62792328). For the bid to be true, Player 0 needs at least one 8 in their 8-digit hand, which is reasonably likely. Challenging is risky. I need to make a higher bid. Options are quantity 3+ or quantity 2 with digit 9. Looking at my hand, I have three 2s. Bidding '3 2s' is a safe and strong bid because it's true based on my hand alone (I have 3, so the total is at least 3). This forces Player 0 to make a significantly higher bid or challenge a likely true statement.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. My hand contains 0 2s, so the opponent must have all 3+ 2s in their 8-card hand. The probability of an opponent having â‰¥3 of a specific digit (2s) in 8 cards is very low (~3.8% assuming uniform distribution). Challenging is statistically favorable, as the bid is likely invalid.
