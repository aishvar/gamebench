Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand (42748998), I have two 9s, two 8s, one 7, one 4, one 2, and no 0s, 1s, 3s, 5s, or 6s. Since I have two 9s in my hand, and 9 is the highest digit, it's a good strategic opening to bid on 9s. The other player has 8 digits, and I have 2 nines, so there could be up to 10 nines total. A conservative first bid would be to claim there are 3 nines total, which is just one more than what I can see in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 nines. I have no nines in my hand. It's unlikely the opponent has enough nines to make this bid valid, given they also have 8 cards. Bidding higher would be risky as I have no information to support a higher count of any digit. A challenge seems like the best course of action.
