Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Starting the bid at 3 7s is reasonable, as there's a chance the opponent has at least one 7, making the total count valid. Choosing a higher digit (7) gives strategic flexibility for future bids.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 7s (digits are 4,5,9,4,2,3,0,4). The current bid is 3 7s, which would require at least 3 sevens across both hands. Since I have zero, that would mean my opponent must have all 3 or more 7s, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. The probability that opponent has 3 or more 7s is quite low, so challenging is a strong move here.
