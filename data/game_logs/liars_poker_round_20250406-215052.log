Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand 63857700, I have two 0s, two 7s, one 3, one 5, one 6, and one 8. Starting with a conservative yet reasonable opening bid, I can choose 3 of a digit I have multiple of. Since I have two 7s, it's likely there are at least three 7s in total. So, bidding 3 7s is a solid opening move.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7. The current bid is 3 7s, and I need to make a higher bid. I can bid 4 7s since it increases the quantity while keeping the same digit, which is a reasonable move given I have at least one 7.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, meaning there must be at least two more 7s in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. Since the average count of any specific digit across both hands is around 3.2 (16 digits / 10 digits), having 4 or more 7s is plausible but somewhat aggressive. However, challenging now might be premature because 4 7s is within a reasonable probability. To maintain pressure and avoid an early challenge, I will raise the bid conservatively to 4 8s, increasing the digit but keeping the quantity the same, as I hold one 8 myself.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, and the current bid of 4 8s seems quite high given that there are only 16 digits total. I should challenge this bid because it seems unlikely that there are 4 or more 8s in both hands combined.
