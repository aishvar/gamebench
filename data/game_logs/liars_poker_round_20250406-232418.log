--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand has two 8s and no 1s. The current bid is 2 1s. Bidding 2 8s is valid as it maintains the quantity but increases the digit. Since I have two 8s, the total count must be at least 2 regardless of the opponent's hand, making this a safe bid that forces the opponent to respond.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I don't have any 8s. I could bid 3 of any digit. I have two 1s and two 4s. I will bid 3 1s, which is a safe increase.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 1S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have 0 1s in my hand. The opponent bid 3 1s, meaning they must have all three in their 8-card hand. The probability of holding exactly three 1s in 8 random digits is low (~3%). Given the bid history started with 2 1s and they raised again, this could be a bluff. Challenging seems favorable as their required 1s concentration is unlikely.
