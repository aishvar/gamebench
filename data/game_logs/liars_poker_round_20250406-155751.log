Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits 2, 7, 6, 5, 7, 0, 9, 3. The counts are: two 7s, one 6, one 5, one 0, one 2, one 9, and one 3. A good opening bid is usually 2 of a digit I have multiple of. I have two 7s, so bidding 2 7s is a safe and reasonable opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the likelihood of the current bid '2 7s'. In my hand (19631228), I have zero 7s. The opponent has claimed there are at least 2 sevens between both our hands. Since I have none, all of those claimed 7s must be in the opponent's hand. This is entirely possible - they could have 2 or more 7s. Given that this is the first bid and it's quite conservative (only claiming 2 of a digit), I don't think this is worth challenging. I should make a higher bid based on what I know about my hand. Looking at my digits, I have: one 1, one 9, one 6, one 3, one 2, two 8s. My best digit is 8, with two occurrences. I could bid '2 8s', which is higher than '2 7s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity. This is a safe bid since I know for certain there are at least 2 eights in the game (both in my hand).

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 27657093, I have no 8s. Since the current bid is 2 8s and I hold none, all 8s must be in Player 1's hand to make the bid valid. This is possible but not highly probable. However, since the bid is quite conservative (only 2 of a digit across 16 digits total), challenging now is risky because it's plausible the opponent has two 8s. Instead, I will raise the bid modestly by increasing the quantity to 3 and choosing a digit where I have some presence to improve my position. I have two 7s, so bidding 3 7s is reasonable and safe.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The current bid is '3 7s', meaning Player 0 claims there are at least 3 sevens between our hands. Looking at my hand (19631228), I have 0 sevens. If Player 0 is telling the truth, they must have at least 3 sevens in their hand. This is possible but somewhat unlikely since they would need to have 3 or more of the same digit in an 8-digit hand. Given that I have no 7s to contribute to this count, I'm skeptical. I could challenge, but I also see I have two 8s in my hand. I could safely bid '3 8s', which is higher than '3 7s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity. This seems like a safer play than challenging, as I know for certain there are at least 2 eights (in my hand).

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 27657093, which contains zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, so all 3 would have to be in my opponent's hand. Since they have only 8 digits, it's quite unlikely they hold 3 or more 8s. The probability of that is low enough to justify a challenge rather than making a risky higher bid.
