Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. Since it's the first bid, I can start with a reasonable quantity. Bidding 4 4s is a moderate bid, assuming the other player has at least one 4. It's likely to be correct and gives me some room to outbid if needed.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. I could bid higher, but I don't have a strong indication that there are many 4s out there. I could bid 5 of some other digit, but I don't have enough information to make a confident bid. Since the current bid is relatively low, and I have no strong reason to believe it's accurate, I'll challenge.
