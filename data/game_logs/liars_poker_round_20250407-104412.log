Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 7, one 9, and two digits '3' and '5' appear once each. A safe opening bid is typically 2 of a digit I hold, but since I only have single occurrences, the most common opening bid is 2 of a mid-value digit. Choosing 2 3s is reasonable because I have one 3, and it's plausible the opponent has at least one as well.
