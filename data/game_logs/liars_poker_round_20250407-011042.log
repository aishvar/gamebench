Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 3 8s leverages the high digit value and assumes the opponent might have at least one 8, making the total count plausible.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 06991692, I have no 8s at all. For the bid of 3 8s to be valid, the opponent would need to have all 3 or more 8s, which is somewhat unlikely given the distribution of digits. Since I have zero 8s, and 3 is a relatively aggressive starting bid for 8s, challenging here is a reasonable strategic move.
