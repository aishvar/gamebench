Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 31814930, I have two 1s and two 3s, and one each of 8, 4, 9, and 0. A conservative opening bid is 2 1s, reflecting my own hand, as there are likely more 1s in the opponent's hand, but I don't want to overcommit early.
