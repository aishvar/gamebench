Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without worrying about being too high. I have two 7s in my hand. Starting with a low quantity and a moderate digit seems reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. I should bid a higher quantity or the same quantity but a higher digit to make a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 9, 3, 1, 2, 7, 0, 6, and 7, 3, and 1 appear twice but no 8s or higher quantity of any digit. The highest digit I have is 7 and 6 and 9 and 3 and 1 and 2 and 0. I can see that bidding 3 8s was made by Player 1. I have one 7 and one 6 and other digits that are lower than 8. I should bid higher than 3 if possible or with a higher digit if I don't have enough quantity. Since I have two 7s, I could bid 4 7s or 4 6s but not 4 8s or higher because I don't have enough 8s or higher digits to make that work. However, I could try 4 7s or 4 6s or 4 0s if that seems more believable given my hand.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have four 8s in my hand, and bidding 4 8s would be a valid higher bid, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains a 7 and a 6, but no 8s. Given that the last bid was 4 8s and I have no 8s, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 7s and the previous bid was 4 7s, I can confidently increase the quantity of 7s. The current bid is 4 8s, so I need to bid higher than 4. I can bid 5 7s or higher, or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. However, I have no 8s or higher digits in abundance, so I will increase the quantity of 7s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have 7 in my hand. I can increase the quantity or digit, but since 7 is in my hand, I should increase the quantity to 6 7s, making a higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is the better option. My hand contains the digits 9, 3, 1, 2, 7, 0, 7, 6. I have two 7s, which means there are at least 4 7s in total if I consider my own 7s and the possibility that Player 1 has at least two 7s as well (given their bid history). The bid of 6 7s seems plausible but I need to determine if I can safely make a higher bid or if challenging is more strategic. Given that I have two 7s and the bid is already at 6 7s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. I have two 7s, so bidding 7 7s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. I should bid a higher quantity or digit to increase my chances of winning. Bidding 8 7s is a reasonable move, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 8 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 7s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains a 7 and other digits, but I don't have enough information about Player 1's hand. However, I can see that bidding higher than 8 7s requires either a higher quantity or a higher digit. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider what digits I have and what would be a reasonable bid. I have two 6s and one 7, and other digits that could potentially add up if I knew their distribution. A safe bet would be to increase the quantity or digit slightly if possible. Given that I have two 6s and the current bid is 8 7s, I could bid 9 0s or increase the digit slightly. However, without exact counts of digits in Player 1's hand, I must make an educated guess. The bid of 8 7s seems high but I do not have enough 7s or higher digits to confidently challenge. I do have a 6 and could potentially use that information.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 9 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 0s. I have 4 1s and 1 0 in my hand. I can safely bid on a higher quantity or digit. Since 9 is already the highest quantity, I'll aim for a higher digit. I notice that the highest digit so far in the bid history is 8, so I'll bid on 9s, which is a reasonable assumption based on my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 0s. Given my hand has no 0s, I should bid a higher quantity or digit to make a valid bid. Since 9 is the highest quantity, I should increase the digit. The highest digit is 9, but it's already in the current bid. The next highest digit is 8, which I have in my hand. Bidding 1 8s seems reasonable.
