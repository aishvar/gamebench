Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s and two 8s, which are good candidates for the opening bid. Opening with a conservative bid of 2 8s is reasonable based on my hand, and it sets a baseline for the game.
