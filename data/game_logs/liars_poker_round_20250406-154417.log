Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 7, one 9, and one more 4. So, I have two 4s, and the rest are singletons. An opening bid of 2 4s is reasonable given my own hand, as there are likely more 4s in the opponent's hand, and it's a modest, safe opening bid.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. Given that I have a hand of 76851803, I can see I have one 4. Considering the total number of digits and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, bidding a higher quantity seems risky without more information. However, I can try to bid higher with a higher digit. Since my hand contains a 6 and a 7, and several other digits, I should consider if there's a possibility to have a higher quantity of a higher digit. The current bid is 2 4s, so I should at least try to bid higher with a digit I have. I have one 4 in my hand, so bidding 3 4s or higher seems reasonable if I think the other player might have more 4s or if I can reasonably guess they have few 4s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 59307414, I have one 5. The current bid is 3 5s, which would require at least two 5s in the opponent's hand to be valid. This is plausible but not guaranteed. Since I have two 4s, bidding 3 6s is not stronger, but bidding 3 6s would only increase the digit, not the quantity. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity with a digit I have more of. I have two 4s, so bidding 4 4s is a reasonable and stronger bid, increasing the quantity from 3 to 4, and leveraging my own hand strength.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 4S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I need to analyze my hand and the bid history. My hand contains the digits 7, 6, 8, 5, 1, 8, 0, and 3. I have a total of 2 8s and one 4. Given that the bid is 4 4s, I should consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since I have two 8s and the bid requires a higher quantity or digit, I should consider bidding higher or challenging if I think the bid is unlikely.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (59307414), I have zero 8s. The current bid is 5 8s, which means there must be at least five 8s across both hands. Since I have none, the opponent would need to have all five or more 8s in their hand of 8 digits. This is highly improbable given the distribution of digits. Therefore, challenging is the best strategic move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
