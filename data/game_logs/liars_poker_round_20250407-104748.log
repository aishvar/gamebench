Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must initiate the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 4s, one 5, one 3, one 8, and one 1. A conservative and reasonable opening bid is 2 4s, as I already hold two 4s and there is a good chance the opponent has at least one or more, making this a safe starting point.
