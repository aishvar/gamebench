Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 6s, and no bids have been made yet. Starting with a conservative bid based on digits I already have multiple copies of is a safe initial strategy. Therefore, bidding 2 6s is reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, which means Player 0 is relying on their own hand to support the bid of 2 6s. While it's possible they have 2 or more 6s, the bid is relatively low, and there is no strong reason to challenge yet. To keep the game going, I will make a higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, so I will bid 3 7s, increasing the quantity and choosing a digit I have more confidence in.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 66145352, containing no 7s. The opponent has bid 3 7s. I have none, so all three 7s would need to be in their hand alone. While possible, it's risky. However, I have two 6s, and previously bid 2 6s. Since I already know about two 6s in my hand, bidding 3 8s or higher would be risky without evidence. Given that I have no 7s and the opponent would need to hold all three 7s, this seems somewhat unlikely. Thus, challenging the current bid is the safer move.
