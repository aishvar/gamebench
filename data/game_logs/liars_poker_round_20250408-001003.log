Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand, which is the highest count among my digits. Starting with a bid of 2 2s is a safe and reasonable move since it's the first bid and I have confidence in the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 2s. Since I know there is at least one 2 in my hand, I can safely bid 3 2s. This is a valid higher bid that satisfies the rules of the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s, which means the total number of 2s must be at least 3 for the bid to be valid. Since I have two 2s, Player 1 must have at least one for the total to be three. Challenging now would likely result in losing if the total is exactly three. Instead, I will bid 4 2s, hoping that Player 1 has two 2s, making the total four and my bid valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand, which means there are at least 6 2s possible when considering my hand and the maximum possible digits from both players. However, since the current bid is 4 2s, I can raise the bid to 5 2s, which is a valid move without risking a challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 2s. Considering the maximum possible, if I have two, Player 1 could have up to three, making the total five. However, it's uncertain and risky. Challenging is a good move as the total might be less than five, making the bid invalid.
