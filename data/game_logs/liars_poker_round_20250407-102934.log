Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 35182228, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but not very strong. Statistically, zeros are less frequent, and since I see none, it's unlikely Player 0 has more than one zero. Instead of challenging such a low opening bid, it's better to raise with a safe, higher bid based on the digits I do hold. I have three 2s and two 8s. Bidding 3 2s is reasonable, as I already hold that many, and it's a strictly higher bid than 1 0s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 3, 5, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8. I see three 2s and no 3s. The current bid is 3 3s, which I cannot confidently support or raise on 3s. Since I hold three 2s myself, it's reasonable to assume there might be at least one more 2 in the opponent's hand, making a total of at least four 2s quite plausible. Therefore, I will raise the bid to 4 2s, which is strictly higher than 3 3s and well supported by my hand.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 35182228, I have zero 3s, but four 2s. The current bid is 4 3s, which I cannot improve upon with 3s since I have none. However, since I hold four 2s myself, it's quite plausible there is at least one more 2 in Player 0's hand, making a bid of 5 2s credible. This is a safe, valid higher bid by increasing the quantity and switching to a digit I hold many of.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 2S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 5 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 5 3s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 5 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 3s and three 2s. The current bid is 5 3s. Since I only have two 3s, for the bid to be valid there must be at least three 3s in Player 0's hand, which is unlikely given 8 digits. Statistically, expecting 5 of a specific digit across 16 cards is already on the higher end, and since I only have two 3s, this bid is quite aggressive. Challenging here is strategically sound because it's improbable there are 5 total 3s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (Naive 50/50) bid of 5 3s.
