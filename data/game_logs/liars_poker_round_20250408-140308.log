Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two 9s in my hand, starting with a bid of 2 9s is a safe initial move. It reflects the count in my hand and leaves room for the opponent to respond.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. Looking at my hand, I have no 9s, which means Player 0 would need at least two 9s in their hand to make this bid valid. This seems plausible but not guaranteed. However, instead of challenging, I can make a higher bid using digits I know I have. I have two 1s and two 4s in my hand, so bidding 3 1s increases the quantity slightly while staying within a digit I have more confidence in.

Player 1 bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. The current bid is 3 1s. Since I already have two, it's plausible that the opponent has at least one more 1, making the bid valid. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or the digit. Raising the digit to 2s, where I have three in my hand, seems like a strong move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 2S'
Player 0 bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 2s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 2s. Based on my hand, I have three 1s and two 6s, which gives me confidence to bid on digits I hold. A reasonable move is to increase the quantity to 4 and choose a digit I have, such as 1s, to maintain a safe but higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 1 bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. The current bid is 4 1s, which means the opponent is claiming there are at least two more 1s in their hand. Given that the total possible 1s in the game is 16, but with only 8 digits per player, it's plausible but risky. I could bid higher, but with my hand showing only two 1s, challenging seems like a safer option to avoid escalating the bid further.
