Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 2s, which is the highest frequency of any digit in my hand. Bidding 2 2s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that at least two 2s exist in total.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity to 3 and keeping the digit as 2, or keep the quantity at 2 and increase the digit to 3. I'll increase the quantity to 3 and keep the digit at 2.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 2s. Since I only have two 2s, it's unlikely there are three 2s in total. Instead of challenging, I can try to shift the focus to another digit. I have three 7s in my hand, so bidding 4 7s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, increasing the quantity and changing the digit to one I have. However, since the previous bids jumped from 2 2s to 3 2s to 4 7s, it seems like they might be bluffing. I will challenge.
