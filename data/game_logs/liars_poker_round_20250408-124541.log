Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: With my hand (79378482), I have two 7s, two 8s, and one each of digits 2, 3, 4, and 9. Given that no bids have been made yet, starting conservatively with digits I have multiple copies of is sensible. I will start by bidding a low quantity on one of these digits to minimize risk and gain more information. I'll choose '3 7s' since I already have two, making it likely there's at least one more across both hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 7s. This means at least two more 7s must be in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. This is plausible, but I can make a higher bid to maintain control of the game. I will bid 4 7s, increasing the quantity while keeping the same digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand (digits: 7, 7). Player 1 raised my initial bid of 3 7s to 4 7s, implying they likely have at least two 7s. Given that I already have two, it's plausible that there are at least four 7s in total. However, bidding higher (e.g., 5 of any digit) would be risky without additional information or confidence. Since 4 7s is plausible, challenging would be risky. Thus, I will cautiously increase the bid to 4 8s, as I have two 8s in my hand, making this a safer incremental bid.

Player 0 bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. In my hand, I have one 8. For the bid to be valid, there must be at least three more 8s in Player 0's hand. While this is possible, it is not guaranteed, and challenging might be a reasonable option. However, I also have two 7s in my hand, which makes a bid of 5 7s plausible since it only requires three additional 7s in Player 0's hand. This is a safer move than challenging at this point.

Player 1 bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand (79378482) contains two 7s. The current bid is 5 7s, meaning there must be at least three additional 7s in my opponent's eight digits. Given that my opponent previously bid 4 7s and then increased to 5 7s, it's likely they have multiple 7s. However, considering there are only 16 digits total, and I already hold two 7s, it's quite plausible my opponent has three or more 7s. Thus, challenging seems risky. Instead, I will make a safer bid by increasing the digit rather than the quantity. Since I already have three 8s, bidding 5 8s is reasonable and safer than challenging.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. In my hand, I have one 8. This means there need to be at least 4 more 8s in Player 0's hand to make the bid valid. While this is possible, it is becoming less likely as the bid quantity increases. However, challenging now seems risky because Player 0 may indeed have enough 8s. To maintain safety and pressure, I will increase the bid to 6 7s. I have two 7s in my hand, so this bid leverages my hand strength while also increasing the quantity, which is a valid move.

Player 1 bids: 6 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand (79378482) contains two 7s. The current bid is 6 7s, meaning my opponent is claiming at least four additional 7s in their eight-digit hand. While it's possible, it's somewhat unlikely they have four or more 7s themselves. However, given the aggressive bidding pattern specifically around digit 7, it's plausible they hold multiple 7s. With two in my hand, only four more are needed from the opponent's eight digits, which is risky but possible. Alternatively, raising the bid further (to 6 8s or 7 0s) seems even more risky, as I only have two 8s and no strong indication of additional 8s. Given the uncertainty and the high stakes, challenging now is the safer strategic choice.
