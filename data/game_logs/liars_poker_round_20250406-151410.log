Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (35772860), I see I have two 7s and one each of 3, 5, 2, 8, 6, and 0. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. Since I have two 7s, bidding on 7s seems like a good start. I'll bid 3 7s, slightly higher than my count to give some room for the other player's possible 7s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s ('29067693'). Since the current bid is 3 7s, and I hold two myself, it's plausible that at least one 7 exists in the opponent's hand, making the total 3 or more. Challenging now would be risky. The minimal safe higher bid would be 3 8s, increasing the digit while keeping quantity the same, which is safer than jumping to 4 of any digit. I have one 9 but no 8s, but statistically, 3 8s is plausible and keeps me in the game.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I see one 8, it's plausible there are more. Bidding 4 8s seems risky but is a possible move. However, bidding 3 9s is a safer option as it keeps the quantity the same and only increases the digit. Given that I don't have any 9s, I'm somewhat skeptical about the presence of many 9s, but it's still a valid bid. I'll choose to bid 3 9s.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s (digits: 2,9,0,6,7,6,9,3). The current bid is 3 9s, so for that bid to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least one more 9. Given the distribution of digits and the fact that 9s are relatively rare, it's unlikely the opponent has two or more 9s, which would make the total 4 or more. Since I have two and the bid is three, it's plausible but risky to raise. I don't have strong evidence to confidently bid 4 9s, but I can increase the quantity by bidding 4 of a lower digit where I have decent coverage. I also have two 6s, so bidding 4 6s is a reasonable and safer incremental bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I can see that I have one 6 in my hand. The total number of 6s across both hands must be at least 4 to justify the current bid. It's possible that the other player has 3 or more 6s. However, the bid history shows an escalating pattern, and bidding 4 7s or higher seems like a reasonable next step as it increases the digit. I will bid 4 7s, which is a valid higher bid than 4 6s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '29067693', I have two 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, which means there need to be at least two more 7s in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution of digits, it is somewhat unlikely Player 0 holds at least two 7s, especially since they previously bid 3 7s and now 4 7s, possibly bluffing. The probability of four or more 7s across both hands is low, so challenging is the best move.
