Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 8.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have no 8s in my hand (23967264). To challenge, I risk losing if the opponent has three 8s. Alternatively, raising to 3 9s (higher digit) is valid. I have one 9, so if the opponent has at least two 9s, the bid holds. This avoids challenging a potentially risky bid and shifts the pressure to the opponent.

Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand, but I have two 8s. Since the opponent bid 3 9s, it's likely they have at least one 9. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable move because it increases the digit while maintaining the quantity, and it's plausible given my hand and the bidding history.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand contains no 8s. The probability of the opponent having at least four 8s in their 8 digits is extremely low (less than 0.5%). Challenging is highly likely to win since the total count is probably â‰¤3.
