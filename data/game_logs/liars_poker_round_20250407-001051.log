--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 7s, one 1, one 9, one 4, and one 5. Opening with a conservative and reasonable bid, I will choose a digit I have multiple of to increase the likelihood of the bid being valid. I have two 7s, so starting with '2 7s' is a solid opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s, meaning the opponent must have at least one more 7 to meet the bid. However, there's a significant chance (~43%) the opponent has zero 7s (calculated via (9/10)^8), making the total 1. Challenging now offers a reasonable probability of success given the low bid quantity and potential bluffing.
