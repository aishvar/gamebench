Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to make the first bid. In my hand, I have two 6s and two 3s, which are my most frequent digits. A reasonable starting bid would be 3 6s, as it accounts for my two 6s and assumes at least one more 6 in the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I could bid 4 0s, which is a slightly higher bid, or I could challenge. Since the bid is relatively low and I don't have strong evidence to challenge, I will make a slightly higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand and the current bid is 4 0s. While I have no 0s, it is unlikely there are many 0s across both hands based on probability. Instead of challenging, I can safely raise the bid to 4 6s since I already hold two 6s, and it's reasonable to assume there are at least two more 6s in the other player's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 5 0s is a valid, safe bid as it increases the quantity and resets the digit. It doesn't rely on my hand and keeps me in the game.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, which makes it unlikely for there to be 5 or more 0s in total across both hands. The maximum possible number of 0s is 16, but given the distribution of my digits, it seems implausible that the other player has at least 5 0s. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
