Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand (23723650), I have: one 0, zero 1s, two 2s, two 3s, zero 4s, one 5, one 6, and one 7. Since I have two 2s and two 3s, these are my most common digits. I'll bid based on one of these. Since there are 16 total digits in the game (8 per player), and I know I have two 3s, there could be up to 6 more 3s in my opponent's hand. A conservative first bid would be '3 3s', suggesting there's at least one more 3 in my opponent's hand, which is reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 56048951, containing digits 5, 6, 0, 4, 8, 9, 5, and 1. I have no digit '3' in my hand. The opponent bid '3 3s', implying they have at least a few '3s' or are bluffing. With 16 digits total, it's plausible they hold three '3s', but I cannot confirm this. However, since I have two '5s' in my hand, bidding '3 5s' would not be higher than the current bid of '3 3s' (same quantity, digit must be higher than 3). Therefore, bidding '3 5s' would be valid and safer, as I already have two '5s', needing only one more from the opponent's hand, which is quite probable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (23723650), I have one 5. The current bid from Player 1 is '3 5s', suggesting there are at least 3 fives total between our hands. Since I only have 1 five, that means Player 1 would need to have at least 2 fives for this bid to be valid. This is certainly possible, but I can make a higher bid based on digits I have more confidence in. I have two 2s and two 3s in my hand. I could bid '3 6s' (higher digit than 5s) or '4 2s' or '4 3s' (higher quantity). Among these options, '4 3s' seems reasonable since I already have two 3s in my hand, meaning Player 1 would only need to have two more 3s for this to be valid. This feels like a safer bid than challenging the current '3 5s' bid, which could very well be valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. My hand is 56048951, containing digits 5, 6, 0, 4, 8, 9, 5, and 1, with no 3s. Since I have no 3s, all four 3s would have to be in Player 0's hand alone. Player 0 increased their own previous bid from 3 to 4, indicating confidence, but it still seems unlikely they alone have all four required 3s. Given the improbability and my lack of 3s, challenging is the safest move.
