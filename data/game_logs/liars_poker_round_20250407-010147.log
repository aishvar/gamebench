Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 75599035. I have three 5s, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. The total number of digits in play is 16 (2 players * 8 digits). The expected average count for any digit is 1.6. Having three 5s is significantly above average. An opening bid should establish a baseline. Bidding '3 5s' accurately reflects the number of 5s I hold. This seems like a strong and relatively safe opening bid, leveraging my hand's strength without overextending early.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 01614744, I have no 5s. The opponent bid '3 5s', claiming there are at least 3 fives total. Since I have zero 5s, this means all 3 would need to be in their hand. While possible, it's somewhat risky. However, rather than challenge immediately, I can make a safer bid. I see I have three 4s in my hand, so bidding '3 6s' is a very safe play - it's a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit) and leaves room for future maneuvering.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand (75599035). For the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 1) must have at least three 6s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is low (approximately 3.8%). Since I hold none of the required digit, the likelihood of the bid being true is significantly reduced. Therefore, challenging the bid is the statistically advantageous move.
