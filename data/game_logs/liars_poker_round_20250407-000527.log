Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid of two 7s is safe because even if the opponent has none, the total count (2) meets the bid. Choosing a higher digit (7) also makes it harder for the opponent to bid higher without increasing quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. Looking at my hand, 57035891, I have one 7. Since I don't have any information about Player 0's hand, I need to decide based on my own hand and the bid. Given that my hand contains one 7 and considering the total possible number of 7s could be up to 16 (8 from each player), bidding higher seems plausible. However, without knowing the exact distribution in the other player's hand, it's a bit risky. Since my hand does not contain a high number of any single digit that would comfortably allow me to bid higher with confidence, and considering the bid is relatively low, I should consider challenging if I think the bid is unlikely or try to make a strategic bid. Given the low quantity of the current bid, I can attempt to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 7, increasing the quantity of 7s might not be the best strategy without more information. However, I do have multiple other digits, and increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same could be a viable strategy if I had a digit that appears more frequently in my hand. My hand has two 5s and other digits that appear once. Given this, I could consider bidding on a different digit that appears at least as frequently as the 7 in my hand or try to challenge if I believe the current bid is unlikely.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand. The opponent's bid of 2 8s requires them to have at least two 8s in their 8-digit hand. Given the low probability of holding two 8s in a random 8-digit hand (approximately 15% chance), challenging is statistically favorable. The opponent might be bluffing after seeing my 2 7s bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) challenges Player 1's (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bid of 2 8s.
