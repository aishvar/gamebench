Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid of the game and no bids have been made yet, I should start with a conservative but reasonable opening bid. Looking at my hand '30927104', the digit '0' appears twice, which is relatively common. Opening with a bid on '2 0s' is safe, but to be slightly more aggressive and account for the opponent likely having at least 1 or 2 zeros as well, I will open with '3 0s'. This is a typical opening bid that reflects my hand and leaves room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have 2 zeros in my hand (16903138). The total number of zeros across both hands must be at least 2 (my zeros) and at most 10 (if Player 0 had all 8 zeros, which is unlikely). Since the bid is 3 0s, it's possible but I need to consider the probability. Given that I have 2 zeros, it's plausible that together we have at least 3 zeros if Player 0 has at least 1 zero. However, I can bid higher to try to get more information or put pressure on Player 0. I can bid '3 1s' as a valid higher bid is not possible with the quantity, so I'll bid on a different digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. Looking at my hand (3 0 9 2 7 1 0 4), I have only one '1'. For the opponent's 8 digits, the expected average number of '1's is roughly 0.8 (since each digit is equally likely), but it could be more or less. To reach 3 total '1's, the opponent would need at least 2 '1's, which is plausible but not very likely. Given I have only one '1', and considering the low probability that the opponent has 2 or more '1's, challenging is a reasonable move here. Bidding 4 1s would be risky based on my hand, so the best action is to challenge.
