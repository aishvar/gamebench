--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. My hand contains multiple 7s, and I can reasonably assume at least one more 7 exists in the other player's hand. Bidding 3 7s seems safe and strategic.

Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 7s (digits are 0, 4, 9, 5, 8, 6, 4, 5). Since I have zero 7s, for the bid of 3 7s to be true, my opponent must have at least 3 sevens out of their 8 digits, which is somewhat unlikely but still possible. However, rather than challenging immediately, a safer approach is to make a minimal higher bid. Since I have two 5s, I can safely bid 3 5s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, lower digit is invalid, so I must increase the digit or quantity). Alternatively, I can bid 3 8s since I have one 8, but that's riskier. The safest minimal raise is to bid 4 of a digit I have multiple of. I have two 4s and two 5s, so bidding 4 5s is reasonable, assuming the opponent might have two or more 5s, which is plausible. Therefore, I will raise to 4 5s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 5s. Since I already bid 3 7s earlier, I should increase both the quantity and the digit. Bidding 5 7s seems reasonable, as it's higher than the current bid and based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (04958645), I have zero 7s. The current bid is 5 7s, which requires there to be at least 5 sevens across both hands. Since I have none, the entire bid relies on the opponent having all 5 or more 7s, which is statistically very unlikely out of their 8 digits. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (cohere/command-a:floor) bid of 5 7s.
