Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 2 ones in my hand. It's likely the other player has at least 1 one, making 3 1s a reasonable opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 94493183. The current bid is 3 1s. I have one '1', so the bid requires the opponent to have at least two '1's out of their 8 digits. This is plausible, making a challenge risky at this stage. I need to make a higher bid. A higher bid must have a quantity greater than 3, or a quantity of 3 and a digit greater than 1. I have two '3's, two '4's, and two '9's in my hand. Bidding '3 3s', '3 4s', or '3 9s' are all valid and supported by my hand, requiring only one matching digit from the opponent. Bidding '3 9s' uses the highest digit among these options, making it a slightly stronger strategic move while still being relatively safe based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand, and it seems reasonable the other 8 digits could contain at least two more 1s, making 4 1s in total. This is a valid raise in quantity from 3 9s to 4 of a digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s made by Player 0. I have one '1' in my hand (94493183). For the bid to be true, Player 0 needs at least three '1's. Player 0 initially bid 3 1s and then raised to 4 1s after my bid of 3 9s. This suggests they might be strong in 1s (possibly holding 3), making a challenge risky. I previously bid 3 9s, and I hold two '9's. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). It is consistent with my previous bid, leverages the two '9's in my hand, and requires Player 0 to have only two '9's for the bid to be true, which is plausible. This seems safer than challenging the 4 1s or bidding on a digit where I hold fewer cards.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The opponent’s claim of 4 9s could be true since I have one 9, so they only need three more. Instead of challenging, I’ll push the bid higher. I hold two 1s, making a total of five 1s a plausible claim if the opponent has at least three. This both increases the quantity (from 4 to 5) and shifts to a digit I have multiple of in my hand.

Player 0 bids: 5 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have one 1 in my hand (94493183). For the bid to be true, the opponent needs at least four 1s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, the opponent's persistent bidding on 1s (3 1s, 4 1s, 5 1s) makes challenging risky, as they likely hold several 1s. A better option is to bid higher. I have two 9s, and previously bid 3 9s and 4 9s. Continuing this pattern by bidding 5 9s is a consistent move. This bid requires the opponent to have three 9s, which is plausible (3 out of 8 digits). This puts the pressure back on the opponent without the immediate risk of a challenge.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I only have one 9 in my hand. For there to be five 9s total, the other player would need at least four in their eight digits, which seems unlikely. I will challenge the bid.
