Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that there are no previous bids and I have a hand with multiple digits, I should start with a bid that reflects the presence of at least one digit in my hand. Since my hand contains two 7s and other digits, bidding on a digit I have the most of seems like a safe start. However, considering the nature of Liar's Poker, starting with a lower quantity and a digit that appears less frequently might be more strategic to avoid immediate challenges. My hand has two 7s, but starting with the highest digit I have multiple of might not be the best strategy. Instead, I'll choose a digit that appears and is not too high to avoid overbidding, considering the total possible count of any digit across both hands is 16. Given these considerations, bidding on one of my less frequent digits or a lower quantity of a more frequent digit could be wise. Since I have at least two of several digits, I could bid on one of those, but given the goal is to make a bid that is reasonable and not too high, starting with a lower quantity and a digit that is present but not overly abundant seems prudent.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 8s but no 7s. The current bid is 2 7s. Bidding 2 8s increases the digit while maintaining the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Since I have exactly two 8s, even if the opponent has none, the total would meet the bid requirement. This is safer than challenging, as the opponent might have two 7s in their 8-card hand.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '2 8s' and my hand '72007392', I notice I have no 8s. However, to make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have any 8s and the next higher digit is 9, which I also don't have, my best option is to increase the quantity of a digit I have. I have three 0s, which gives me a basis for a bid. Bidding on a digit I have more of seems safer than challenging without having any 8s to gauge the likelihood of the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand (58181696). The current bid is 3 0s, meaning Player 0 must have all three. With only 8 digits, the probability of them holding exactly 3 low-value 0s is statistically low given uniform distribution assumptions. Previous bids (2 7s -> 2 8s -> 3 0s) suggest possible bluffs. Challenging now has favorable odds given the unlikelihood of three 0s existing.
