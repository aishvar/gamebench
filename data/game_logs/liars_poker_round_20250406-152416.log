Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (01037113), I have 3 odd digits and the rest are even, with a notable presence of 1s and 3s. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative yet based on some information. I see I have two 1s and one 3, so bidding on 1s seems reasonable as it's a relatively high count. I'll bid 3 1s to start.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 1s, but I have three 8s and two 6s. The current bid is 3 1s, which is modest, but since I have no 1s, it's risky to raise on 1s. Given my strong count of 8s, a safe and natural higher bid is 3 8s, which matches the quantity but with a higher digit, thus legally increasing the bid while aligning with my hand's strength.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 1 and three 3s in my hand, but no 8s. The bid of 3 8s is not extremely high given the total count of digits is 16. However, I can bid higher by increasing the digit. Since I have a 3, I can make a reasonable guess that there might be more 3s or higher digits. I will bid 3 9s, increasing the digit to make a higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s and two 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, which already accounts for almost all the 9s I possess. Given that I hold two 9s, the opponent would only need to have one 9 to make the bid valid, which is quite plausible. Challenging now is risky. Alternatively, I can increase the bid to 4 8s, since I have two 8s myself, and it's reasonable to expect at least two more 8s across both hands. This bid increases the quantity and switches to a digit I have strong representation in.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 1 and no 8s in my hand. The bid history indicates that Player 1 initially bid 3 8s after my 3 1s and 3 9s. Since I have no 8s, there are at least four 8s in Player 1's hand. Given that I have seen 7 digits so far (my hand) and there are 8 digits per player, there are 9 remaining digits in Player 1's hand. It's possible they have four or more 8s. However, bidding more than 4 8s seems challenging because it would require more than half of the remaining unseen digits to be 8s. I can either challenge the bid or make a slightly higher bid. Since I don't have a strong digit to bid on (like multiple occurrences of a digit), I'll challenge the bid as it seems unlikely they have more than four 8s given the distribution.
