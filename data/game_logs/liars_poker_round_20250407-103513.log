Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 7s, two 3s, one 1, one 8, and one 9. Starting conservatively, the most promising digits to bid on are 0s or 7s since I have two of each. A safe opening bid is 2 7s, as it's likely there are more 7s across both hands, and it sets a reasonable baseline.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s. Since the current bid is 2 8s, and I already hold both, it's quite unlikely my opponent has any more 8s, making a challenge risky. A safe strategic move is to increase the bid slightly. I don't have many 9s (only one), but I can confidently raise the bid to 2 9s, which is a higher digit at the same quantity, keeping the pressure on without overcommitting.
