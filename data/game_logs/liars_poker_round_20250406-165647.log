Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, meaning this is the first bid. I have one 7, one 3, one 1, one 5, one 9, one 0, one 4, and one 1 in my hand. A safe starting bid would be to bid 1 of the digits I have. I'll start with 1 0s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s, which is extremely low. Since I have a 0 in my hand, I can safely assume there are at least 2 0s in total. I can bid 3 0s, increasing the quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 4 0s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I believe it's plausible given the total number of cards in play. Bidding a higher digit would require me to estimate the likelihood of more of that digit existing in the other player's hand, which is less certain than increasing the quantity of 0s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand and two other players, so at least 3 0s are in play. Given the current bid, it's likely that the other players have 0s as well. I'll bid 5 1s, which is a higher digit than the current bid, increasing my chances of winning.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Bidding 6 1s is a possibility, but feels risky. I could bid on another digit I have. I have one 3, one 4, one 5, one 7, one 9, and one 0. Bidding 2 3s is a reasonable increase from the previous bids. It's a safe bid given my hand and the history of bids on 0s.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Bidding 6 1s would be a reasonable increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 0, but the previous bids on 0 suggest it's risky. Increasing the quantity of 1s seems the most logical move.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have one 2 and one 4, but no 1s in my hand. However, I have a 6, which is a higher digit than the current bid. I can make a reasonable bid with a higher digit, increasing the quantity by 1 to 7, but I don't have a 7. Instead, I can increase the quantity and digit by 1, but I don't have a 7. A better option is to bid on the 6s, which I do have. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 7 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 7 6s

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have a 6 in my hand. To make a reasonable bid, I could increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 8 6s is possible but risky. Increasing the digit to 7 7s is also possible. Given the previous bids focused on low digits, and I have a 7 in my hand, bidding 7 7s seems like a good option. It's a slight increase in digit and maintains the quantity, making it plausible without being overly aggressive.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 8 7s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 9 7s would be a reasonable increase in quantity, and it's possible, though not guaranteed, given that there are 16 total digits. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have a 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 0. Bidding higher on any of these feels less strategically sound than trying to push the 7s, as the opponent has already shown a willingness to bid on 7s. Bidding 9 7s is the most logical next step.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 7S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 9 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 7s. I have 2 7s in my hand, and the bid is for 7s. I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity or the digit. However, I don't have any higher digits in my hand, so I'll increase the quantity to 10 and keep the digit as 7.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 10 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. It's unlikely there are 10 7s in total, given that there are only 16 digits in play and we've already established a pattern of escalating bids. Challenging seems like the best course of action, as a higher bid would be a significant risk with limited information.
