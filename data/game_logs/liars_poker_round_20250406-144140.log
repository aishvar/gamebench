Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 8s, and one each of 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9. Starting with a conservative yet reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 7s, reflecting my hand strength and leaving room for escalation.

Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. My hand has no 7s, so the total count depends on Player 0's hand. The probability of Player 0 having fewer than 2 7s is high (over 80%). Challenging is statistically favorable.
