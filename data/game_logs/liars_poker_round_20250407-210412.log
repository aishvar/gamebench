Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand has one '0' (from the digit '0' in 94036831). Since the current bid is '1 0s' and I know there is at least one '0' in my hand, it's likely that there could be one or more '0s' in Player 0's hand as well. However, since Player 0 is 'Naive 50/50', they may not be bluffing. To keep the game going and potentially force a higher bid, I will make a minimal increase by bidding on a higher digit ('1s' instead of '0s').

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 9, 4, 0, 3, 6, 8, 3, 1. There are no 2s in my hand. The current bid is '1 2s', which means Player 0 is claiming there is at least one '2' between both our hands. Since I have no 2s, it's possible Player 0 has one 2, making the bid valid. However, since Player 0 is labeled 'Naive 50/50', they might be making random bids. Given that, there's a 50% chance the bid is invalid. Since the bid is low (only 1), it's safer to raise the bid to a digit I know exists in my hand rather than challenge. I have two 3s, so bidding '2 3s' would be a safe increase.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one '4' (94036831). The current bid is '2 4s'. Given that there are 16 digits in total (8 per player), and I only have one '4', it's statistically unlikely that the opponent has another '4' to make the total count 2. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
