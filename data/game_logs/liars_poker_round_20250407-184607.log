Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning this is the first bid. I have two 2s, two 4s, and two 5s in my hand. A safe starting bid would be to bid a quantity of 2 for the digit 2. This is reasonable as I know I have at least two 2s, and it's unlikely the opponent has enough 2s to make a bid of 3 or more believable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Player 0 bid 2 2s, and I do not have any 2s in my hand. The current bid is low, and I have two 6s, making it safer to bid on a digit I hold. Bidding 2 6s is higher than 2 2s and leverages my known quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. My hand contains zero 6s. My opponent bid 2 6s after I bid 2 2s. It's unlikely they have two 6s given my hand and the previous bid. I will challenge the bid. If they are lying, I win. If they are not lying, I lose, but I assess the risk as worth taking.
