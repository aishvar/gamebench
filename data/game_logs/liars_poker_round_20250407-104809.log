Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 30788639, which contains three 3s, one 0, two 8s, two 6s, and one 9. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. I have multiple 8s, so bidding on 8s seems like a good start. I'll bid 3 8s as it's a moderate quantity and reflects my hand somewhat.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. To increase the bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I will increase the digit to 3 9s, which is a safe and valid move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (from 30788639). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since I see one 9, it's possible there are two more 9s in the other player's hand. Increasing the quantity to 4 with a lower or the same digit is a reasonable move. I will bid 4 8s as it is a higher quantity and I have seen three 8s in total (including mine), making it a relatively safer bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I don't have any 8s in my hand. Since there are 16 total digits, 4 8s is plausible, but not extremely likely. I could bid higher, but I'm not confident in any particular digit. Challenging is a reasonable option since the bid is not too high.
