Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I can make the first bid. I have the digits 8, 3, 3, 7, 8, 0, 8, 6 in my hand. The digit '8' appears three times, which is a relatively strong presence. I will start by bidding on the digit '8' with a quantity that reflects a reasonable estimate considering my hand and the possibility of the other player's hand. Bidding '4 8s' seems like a good starting point as it is a conservative estimate given that I have three '8s' and there's a possibility the other player might have at least one '8'.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 29706091, I have zero 8s. Since there are 16 digits total and I hold none, all 4 (or more) 8s would have to be in the opponent's 8 digits. The probability of that is very low, as the expected number of 8s per hand is roughly 1.6. Therefore, the bid of 4 8s is quite aggressive and unlikely to be true. It's better to challenge now.
