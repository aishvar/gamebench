Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, making it a safe choice to bid 2 5s. This ensures that even if the opponent has none, the total is exactly 2, which meets the bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s, which means the opponent must have at least one 5 to make the bid valid. Since the bid is still low and I have one 5, it's reasonable to increase the bid slightly. I'll bid 3 5s, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 5s. Considering the possibility that Player 1 has at least one 5, the total could be 3 or more. Bidding 4 5s is a strategic move to potentially increase the bid, as the total could be 4 if Player 1 has two 5s. This bid is higher than the current bid and leverages my hand's strength in 5s.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0, one 2, one 4, two 7s, one 8, one 9, and no 5s in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s. Since I have no 5s, the opponent must have at least 4 5s in their hand for the bid to be valid. Given that there are only 8 digits in their hand, having 4 of the same digit is possible but unlikely. Challenging seems like a reasonable move.
