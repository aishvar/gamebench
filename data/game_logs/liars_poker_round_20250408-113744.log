Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid and it's my turn, I need to make the first bid. My hand is 56454839, which contains two 4s, two 5s, and one each of 3, 6, 8, and 9. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and consider the total count across both players. I have a total of 8 digits, and there are 8 digits in the other player's hand as well, making 16 digits in total. I will bid on a digit that I have in my hand. Bidding 3 4s seems like a conservative start because it is a digit I have and it accounts for a reasonable distribution across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have a 4 in my hand, but I also have a 9. Given the current bid quantity is 3, I can safely increase the quantity to 4 and maintain the same digit, increasing the likelihood of having at least four 4s in total. This is a reasonable and safe bid based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 56454839, which contains three 4s and one 5. The current bid is 4 4s by Player 1. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. I have three 4s, so it's plausible that there are at least four 4s in total. However, bidding more than 4 4s with the information I have is uncertain. I can bid 4 5s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid. This seems reasonable given my hand and the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s. Bidding 5 5s is a reasonable increase in quantity, but since I have only two 5s, I should be cautious. However, without any other digits in my hand, I don't have a better option. I'll make a bid, but I'll need to be careful not to overbid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 56454839, which contains three 5s. The current bid is 5 5s. I need to make a higher bid than 5 5s. Since I have three 5s, it's possible that the total count of 5s is indeed 5 or more across both hands. I will increase the quantity to make a higher bid. Bidding 6 5s is a reasonable next step as it is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 7 5s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Player 1 bids: 7 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 5s. My hand is 56454839, which contains three 5s. The total count of 5s across both hands must be at least 6 (3 in my hand and at least 3 in the opponent's hand, as inferred from the bid history). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 8 5s seems plausible because it is still below the maximum possible quantity of 16. However, I can also consider bidding on a higher digit. Since I have visibility into my own hand, I see that I have two 8s and no 9s or higher digits are present in my hand in significant numbers. Bidding 7 6s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit and keeps the quantity the same, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Based on my hand, I have 9 and 0, which are not present in the current bid. The current bid is 7 6s, and I notice that Player 0 has been increasing the quantity and digit in their bids. I should bid higher than 7 6s, but I don't have a high digit in my hand. I'll increase the quantity to 8 and keep the digit as 6, as it's the highest digit I can bid on.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (56454839), so I know there are at least 2 6s. The total count of 6s across both hands must be at least 2 and could be up to 10 if the other player has 8 6s, which is plausible but unlikely. However, bidding more than 8 6s requires a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. I can bid 8 7s or 9 0s (or any other digit). Since my hand doesn't give me information about the other player's hand, I'll consider a conservative increase. Bidding 9 6s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 9 6s. Since I know I have only one 6, and the current bid is already high, I should challenge the current bid.
