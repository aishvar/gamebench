Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand '10324972', I notice I have two 2s, two 1s (digit '1' appears once), one 0, one 3, one 4, one 9, one 7. The most promising starting bid is usually on a digit I have at least one of, preferably more. I have two 2s, so a safe and strong opening bid is '2 2s', indicating I believe there are at least two 2s across both hands, which is guaranteed because I hold two myself. This is a standard and safe opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (75894254), I see I have two 2s. The current bid is '2 2s'. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have two 2s, bidding a higher quantity than 2 is not possible for me with this digit. I can bid on a higher digit if I have it. Looking at my hand, I have one 5, one 7, one 8, one 9, one 4, and one other digits (0, 1, 3, 6 are missing). I have one 5, one 7, one 8, one 9, and other digits. I see I have one 5. If I bid on 1 5, it would be a lower digit bid but with quantity 1 which does not beat '2 2s'. However, I can try to challenge if I think the bid of '2 2s' is unlikely to be beaten or higher. But first, let's see if bidding is an option.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 2s'. I need to either make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains two 2s. The maximum possible quantity for any digit across both hands is 16. I should consider bidding on a digit that I have a high count of or challenging if I think the bid is unlikely. Since I have two 2s and it's a low bid, I should consider making a bid on a higher digit or the same digit with a higher quantity if I have it.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 fives. Looking at my hand (10324972), I have zero 5s. Since I have none, the entire count of 5s relies on Player 1's hand. For the bid to be valid, Player 1 would need to have all 3 or more 5s, which is unlikely given the distribution of digits. Players typically have about 1-2 of any digit in their 8-digit hand on average. So, the probability that there are at least 3 fives total is low. Therefore, challenging is the best move here.
