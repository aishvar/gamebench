Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid. I will start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have three 5s and two 9s. A bid of 3 5s seems reasonable given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, which makes it less likely that there are 3 5s in total across both hands. However, it is still plausible that Player 0 has at least three 5s. Instead of challenging, I will make a higher bid based on the digits I do have. I have three 1s in my hand, so bidding 4 1s is a reasonable and safe move to increase the quantity while staying within what I know about my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 5s and other digits, but no 1s. Given that I have a 5 and the bid needs to be higher than 4 1s, I can bid a higher quantity or a higher digit. Since I have two 5s, bidding 5 5s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 5S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, making it less likely that there are at least 5 5s across both hands. Given the current bid of 5 5s and my lack of 5s, I find it reasonable to challenge this bid, as it seems unlikely that Player 0 has enough 5s to make the bid valid.
