Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative opening bid. I have one 4 in my hand, so I will bid 1 4s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 32386576. I note that I do not have any 4s, so the current bid of 1 4s isn’t backed by me. However, I do have one 5, which guarantees that there is at least one 5 among all 16 digits. Since a bid must be strictly higher than 1 4s, bidding 1 5s (same quantity, but with a higher digit) is a safe and minimal raise.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 32386576, and I have two 6s. The current bid is 2 5s, and since bidding with the same quantity but a higher digit is allowed, I can safely bid 2 6s because I am guaranteed two 6s in total. This bid is safe from my perspective and forces my opponent to either challenge or raise further.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 3 6s is a safe increase, and I know at least one 6 exists.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 32386576, which gives me two 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, meaning that besides my two 6s, the opponent must have at least one 6 for the bid to hold—a probability of roughly 57% given 8 unknown digits. Rather than calling that bid (which would give me only a 43% chance to win), I opt to escalate. By raising the bid to 4 6s, I lean on the strength of my two 6s and force the opponent to supply two additional 6s from their hand—a much less likely event. This tighter bid pressure is my best strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 5 6s seems like a reasonable increase, and it's not too high to be unbelievable.

Player 0 bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have only two 6s in my hand, and the current bid of 5 6s means that at least three 6s must come from the opponent's 8 unknown digits. Considering that each digit has a 10% chance of being a 6, the probability of the opponent having three or more 6s is extremely low. Thus, challenging the bid is the most prudent action.
