Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid. I have two 1s, one 2, two 5s, one 8, and one 9. A safe starting bid is to claim there are at least three 1s. This is reasonable given I have two, and my opponent could have some as well. It's unlikely they have zero 1s. The quantity of 3 is a good starting point as it's not overly aggressive.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 ones. Looking at my hand (7, 2, 4, 4, 3, 0, 8, 9), I have zero '1's. Since I have none, for the bid of 3 ones to be true, the opponent must have all 3 or more ones, which is unlikely given typical distribution. The probability that the opponent has 3 or more ones out of 8 digits is low (~10-15%), making the current bid risky to accept. Rather than raising to a higher or riskier bid, the best strategic move is to challenge, expecting the bid to be false.
