Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 5, 4, 6, 2, 5, 3, 9, 7, and there are no 0s. The current bid is only 1 zero, which is quite plausible since I have none, but the opponent may have one zero in their hand of eight digits. Challenging now is risky because 1 zero is very likely. To safely increase the bid, I should pick a digit I have multiple of. I have two 5s, so bidding 2 5s increases the quantity and is supported by my hand.
