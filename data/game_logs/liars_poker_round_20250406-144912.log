--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand '20371300', I have three 0s, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 7, and one 3. The most frequent digit in my hand is 0, appearing three times. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 3 0s, reflecting my strong holding of zeros while not overcommitting.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. To increase the bid, I can choose a higher digit. I have two 8s in my hand. The total number of 8s across all players is expected to be around 4.4 (my two plus others' expected 2.4). The bid of 3 8s is valid and likely true.

Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 4 8s would be a reasonable increase, as it's only a small increase in quantity. However, given that the previous bid was 3 0s, and 0s are generally more common than 8s, 3 8s already seems a bit high. I don't have any other digits that appear frequently in my hand to make a significantly higher bid. Therefore, challenging the bid is a good strategy, as it's likely inflated.
