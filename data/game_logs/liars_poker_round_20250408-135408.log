Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have the digits 8, 7, 9, 4, 2, 8, 0, and 1. Digit '8' appears twice in my hand, making it a relatively safer digit to bid initially. Since there are 16 total digits across both hands, starting with a conservative bid of '3 8s' seems reasonable, as it's likely at least one additional '8' exists in my opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which is plausible but not certain. I can either bid higher or challenge. Since I only have one 8, bidding 4 8s would be risky. However, I can bid 3 9s, increasing the digit while maintaining the same quantity, as I have one 9 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains one '8' and one '9'. Previously, I bid '3 8s', and my opponent raised to '3 9s'. I have only one '9', so to reach a total of three '9s', my opponent would need at least two '9s'. With 16 digits in total, it's plausible but uncertain. However, I cannot be confident enough to challenge yet. Instead, I can safely increase the quantity to '4 0s' since I have one '0', and zeros are common enough that four total zeros is plausible.

Player 0 bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, making a total of at least two 0s in play. The current bid is 4 0s, which seems plausible but not certain. I can increase the quantity to 5 or choose a higher digit. Since I have two 1s, bidding 5 1s is a reasonable increase, both in quantity and digit, based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand (87942801) contains only one '1'. The opponent bid 5 '1's, suggesting they likely have multiple '1's. However, given there are only 16 digits total and I have just one '1', the opponent would need to have at least four '1's to justify their bid. While possible, this seems somewhat risky. Still, challenging could be dangerous without strong evidence. Alternatively, I could consider bidding higher. My hand contains two '8's (digits 8 and 8), and the previous bidding history includes my initial bid of 3 '8's, which the opponent did not directly challenge but instead shifted digits. This suggests the opponent might hold at least one '8'. Therefore, bidding 5 '8's could be safer, leveraging the strength of my hand and previous bidding behavior.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 5 8s, which implies there are at least five 8s in total. Since I only have one 8, the only way this bid could be valid is if the other player has at least four 8s. This seems highly unlikely given the random distribution of digits. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
