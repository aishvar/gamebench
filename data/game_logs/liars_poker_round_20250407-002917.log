Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, which is the highest frequency of any digit. Bidding 2 5s is a safe starting point, as it's based on my actual hand and sets a baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s, which means there must be at least one more 6 in the other player's hand. Given that I only have one 6, I cannot safely increase the quantity of 6s. However, I can try to increase the digit. The next higher digit is 7, and I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable, as it increases both the quantity and the digit based on my hand.
