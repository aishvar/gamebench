Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand has two 8s. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid of 2 8s is safe because even if the opponent has no 8s, the total count (2) meets the bid. This also forces the opponent to bid higher quantities or digits, starting the game conservatively.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Given the low quantity and digit, I can safely bid a higher quantity or digit without revealing too much about my hand. I'll bid 3 9s, increasing both quantity and digit.

Player 1 bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. For the current bid of 3 9s to be valid, Player 1 must have at least two 9s in their 8-digit hand. Given the low probability of any specific digit appearing multiple times in randomly distributed hands, there's an approximately 81% chance Player 1 has fewer than two 9s. This makes challenging statistically favorable over making a higher bid with similar uncertainty.
