Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I see two 8s, two 0s, two 6s, one 5, and one 2. The current bid is only 1 0s, and since I already have two 0s myself, it's very likely there are more 0s overall. Therefore, I can safely increase the quantity for 0s to 2, making a higher but still reasonable bid.
