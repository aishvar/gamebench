--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I don't have any 6s. I could bid 4 of a low number, but that seems risky. I could also challenge, but 3 6s isn't an unreasonable bid given that there are 16 digits in total. I will bid slightly higher to try and force the other player to make a mistake. I will bid 4 0s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. I could bid 4 of another digit, but I have two 2s and two 7s. Bidding 5 2s seems like a reasonable increase, given my hand. It's slightly more aggressive than bidding 4 of a higher digit, but I want to test the waters.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have zero 3s in my hand. To bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. I could bid 6 of any digit, or 5 of a digit higher than 3. I'll bid 6 0s, as that increases the quantity and 0 is a safe digit to bid.
