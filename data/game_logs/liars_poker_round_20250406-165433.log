Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 3, one 4, two 8s, one 5, one 7, and one 9. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 8s, as I already have two 8s, making it quite likely there are at least two 8s across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I don't have any 8s in my hand. Since the bid is relatively low, I will increase the quantity and bid 3 9s.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 78305489, I have two 9s. For the current bid of 3 9s to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least one 9. Given that each player has 8 digits and I hold two of the 9s, it is somewhat unlikely but still plausible that the opponent has one or more 9s, making the total at least 3. Since the bid is not overly aggressive, I will make a higher but reasonable bid by increasing the quantity to 4 and choosing a digit I have strong representation of. I have two 8s as well, so bidding 4 8s is a sensible next move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. To bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. I could bid 4 9s, or 5 of any digit. Since I have no strong information, I'll bid 5 0s, hoping the other player doesn't have many 0s and is bluffing.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 78305489, I have exactly one 0. The opponent bid 5 0s, implying there are at least five zeros between both hands. Since I only have one 0, the opponent would need to have at least four zeros, which is quite unlikely given 8 digits. The expected average count of any digit across 16 digits is about 1.6, so five zeros is a high bid. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
