Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. The current bid is 1 0s. Since there are two players, the total number of 0s is likely to be at least 2. Bidding 2 0s is a safe and reasonable increase, as it is higher than the current bid and based on the digits I have.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 1s. Since I only have one 1, it's unlikely there are two 1s in total. However, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity to 3 for a lower digit, such as 0, which I have two of in my hand. This bid is higher than the current bid and seems reasonable based on my hand.
