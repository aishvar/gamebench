Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, two 5s, two 8s, one 7, and one 1. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 4s, reflecting my pair of 4s, which is likely to be supported by my opponent's hand as well. This sets a solid foundation without overcommitting early.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 5s (digits: 5, 4, 8, 8, 4, 7, 5, 1). Since the current bid is 2 5s, and I already hold exactly two 5s, it is quite likely that there may be additional 5s in Player 1's hand, making a challenge risky. To maintain a safe position, I will increase the quantity by one and choose a digit I have multiple of. I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s is a reasonable incremental bid that is believable and raises the quantity.
