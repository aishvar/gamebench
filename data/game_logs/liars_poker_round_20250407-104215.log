Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, making it unlikely that there are many 0s overall. The current bid is only 1 0s, which is quite plausible since the other player might have a single 0. To avoid an early challenge on a very safe bid, I will increase the bid minimally by raising the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving to 1 1s since I have one '1' in my hand.
