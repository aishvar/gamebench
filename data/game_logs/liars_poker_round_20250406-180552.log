Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. My hand is 75415674, which contains no 0s. Given that there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand, and my hand has no 0s, the total count of 0s cannot be more than 8. The bid of 1 0s is quite conservative and likely underestimating the total count of 0s if the opponent had a few. However, it's a valid starting point. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have no information about 0s in the opponent's hand and my hand doesn't contain 0s, I'll consider a reasonable increase. Bidding 1 1s is a valid higher bid because it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.
