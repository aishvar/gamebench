Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I must open with a bid. My hand has three 6s (6,6,6), making 3 6s a logical starting bid based on my own digits. Starting with an accurate count here minimizes risk while setting the initial challenge for the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 01729124, I have no 6s. Since the total number of digits is 16 and I have zero 6s, the opponent would need at least 3 6s in their hand to make their bid valid. The probability that they have 3 or more 6s in 8 digits is quite low. Therefore, it's a good opportunity to challenge the bid.
