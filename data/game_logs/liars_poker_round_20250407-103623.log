Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. My hand contains three 7s, two 2s, one 9, one 0, and one 3. A conservative and strategic opening bid is to select a digit I have multiple of, such as 7. Given I hold three 7s, it's plausible there are at least four 7s total across both hands. Therefore, I will start with a reasonable bid of 3 7s, reflecting my strong holding and leaving room to escalate.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 7s, zero 8s, and the current bid is 3 8s. Since I have no 8s, the other player would need to have at least all three 8s for the bid to be valid, which is unlikely. Given the low probability that my opponent holds three or more 8s, challenging is the best move.
