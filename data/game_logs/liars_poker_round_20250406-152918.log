Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 2, one 3, two 6s, one 5, one 7, and one 9. A safe opening bid is to bet on a digit I have multiple of. I have two 6s, so a conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 6s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 (from 40352407) in my hand, so it's plausible that there's at least one more 6 in Player 0's hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have some information about my hand and the current bid is not extremely high, I'll increase the quantity. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, which requires at least one more 6 in Player 1's hand. Given the distribution, it's quite plausible there is at least one 6 in the other hand, so challenging now would be risky. To maintain a strong position, I will increase the quantity by one and bid 4 6s, leveraging my two known 6s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 4 and no 6s in my hand, totaling 8 digits. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about the exact count of 6s, I'll consider the possibilities. The maximum quantity is 16, and bidding 5 6s is a relatively safe increase in quantity. Alternatively, bidding the same quantity with a higher digit is also an option. I'll choose to bid 4 7s, as it is a higher bid and seems plausible given that I don't have any 7s, implying the other player might have some.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (15623697), I have one 7 and one 6. The current bid is 4 7s, meaning there must be at least four 7s across both hands. Since I only have one, Player 1 would need at least three 7s for the bid to be valid. The probability of this is quite low given there are only eight digits in their hand. It's unlikely they have three or more 7s, so challenging is the best move.
