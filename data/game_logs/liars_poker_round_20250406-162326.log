Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can make the first bid. I have the digits 73484556, which gives me a count of 2 fives, 2 fours, 1 seven, 1 three, and 1 six. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative and based on my hand. I have a total of 2 fives, so bidding '2 5s' seems like a safe and reasonable start as it reflects the count of one of the digits in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 0, 7, 3, 1, 9, 3, 8, 6. I see that I have three 3s and two 9s, but no 5s or higher quantity of any single digit. A reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity or digit. Since I have two 3s, I could bid on 3 3s or higher. However, I should be cautious and not overbid. I will increase the quantity and choose a digit that I have in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one 3 in my hand (from 73484556). So, there are at least 4 threes in total. I can increase the quantity. I also have multiple 5s, so bidding 4 5s is a reasonable move as it increases both the quantity and the digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I need to analyze my hand and the bid history. My hand contains the digits: 0, 7, 3, 1, 9, 3, 8, 6. I have two 3s, which could be useful. The bid history shows that Player 0 bid 2 5s and then 4 5s. Given that my hand has two 3s and the last bid was 4 5s, I should consider bidding higher than 4 or bidding a different digit. Since I have two 3s and the current bid is 4 5s, I could bid 5 3s to increase the quantity while staying with a relatively high digit, considering my available digits.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have many 3s, I'll consider increasing the digit. I have multiple 5s, so bidding 5 5s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I need to analyze my hand and the bid history. My hand contains the digits 0, 7, 3, 1, 9, 3, 8, 6. I have two 3s. The last bid was 5 5s by Player 0. Given that I have two 3s and the previous bids, I should try to make a higher bid. The bid history shows that Player 0 bid 2 5s, then 4 5s, and now 5 5s. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. I have two 3s, and the current bid is 5 5s. I can try to bid higher than 5, or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. However, I should be cautious about overbidding. A reasonable next bid could be to increase the quantity or the digit. I can bid 6 3s as I have two 3s and it's a higher quantity than 5 5s but with a lower digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. I have the digits 73484556, which means I have one 3. The total count of 3s across both hands must be at least 6 (the current bid) or more for the bid to be valid. Given that I have one 3, my opponent must have at least 5 3s. While possible, it's a bit high. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I can bid 6 4s or 7 3s. Since I have two 5s and one 4, I can reasonably assume there might be more 5s or 4s. Bidding 6 4s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases the digit and is based on having some information about my own hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid can be beaten. My hand contains the digits 0, 7, 3, 1, 9, 3, 8, 6. I have two 3s, which could be useful. The bid history shows increasing quantities and digits. Given that I have two 3s and the last bid was 6 4s, I should consider if I can safely bid higher. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should look for a digit that appears multiple times in my hand or seems likely to appear in Player 0's hand. I have two 3s, and the current bid does not include 3s. A bid of 7 3s could be risky but seems plausible given my hand and the goal to outbid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have information about the exact count of 3s or higher digits in the other player's hand, I'll analyze my hand to decide. My hand is 73484556, which has one 3, two 4s, two 5s. I can bid higher than 7 3s by either bidding 7 4s or 8 3s/8 4s/8 5s. Bidding 7 4s is a reasonable choice because I have two 4s, making it plausible that there are at least 5 other 4s between us. However, bidding 8 3s is also plausible as it's a relatively small increase in quantity. I'll choose to bid 7 4s as it's a safer option given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 4s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 0, 7, 3, 1, 9, 3, 8, 6. I see two 3s in my hand. The last bid was 7 4s, so I need to bid higher than 7. I can bid 8 3s or higher quantity with a lower digit, but I don't see a clear higher digit than 4. I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 3s and the previous bids have included several 3s and 5 3s was bid previously, I think bidding 9 3s could be reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit compared to 7 4s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 9 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 3s. My hand is 73484556, which contains one 3. This means there are 15 digits left in both hands, and the remaining count of 3s could be up to 14 (if the other player has none) or as low as 8 (if the other player has 6 or more 3s). The bid of 9 3s is plausible because it's within the possible range. However, it's on the higher side. I have two 4s and two 5s, which gives me some confidence in those digits. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 9 4s or 9 5s would be a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit. Since I have more 5s than 4s in my hand, bidding 9 5s seems more likely to be true or at least harder to verify as false.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 5s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 0, 7, 3, 1, 9, 3, 8, 6. I see that I have two 3s, which could be useful. However, bidding requires a quantity and digit that must be higher than the current bid of 9 5s. Since I only have one digit that is a 5 or higher (none), and I have two 3s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. The current bid is quite high, and with only 8 digits in my hand, I don't have enough 5s or higher digits to confidently bid higher on 5 or higher digits. But I can try to bid higher on a lower digit. I have two 3s and the current highest bid on 3 is 7 3s, so I could try to bid higher on 3. However, I also see that I could challenge if I think it's unlikely. Given my hand and the bid history, I should consider if there's a likely chance the other player has more than 9 5s, which seems unlikely given the distribution of digits.
