--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, two 4s, two 0s, one 3, one 5, and one 9. A conservative but reasonable opening bid would be 2 6s, as I already hold two 6s myself, making it plausible that there could be more but not overcommitting early.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s and two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s. Since I have two 6s, it's likely that the other player has at least one 6, making a bid of 3 6s reasonable. This bid increases the quantity while keeping the same digit, which is a valid strategy in Liar's Poker.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, which is plausible assuming my opponent has at least one 6. Since I hold two 6s, it is risky to challenge now. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or bid the same quantity on a higher digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s but only one 9, one 5, one 3, and one 0. The best strategic move is to increase the quantity on a digit I have some presence in. I will bid 4 6s, leveraging my two 6s and hoping my opponent has at least two more combined.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. While I don't have enough information to confidently challenge, I can make a reasonable bid by increasing the quantity to 5 and the digit to 7, as I have one 7 in my hand. This bid is higher than the current bid in both quantity and digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (95643064), I have no 7s at all. Since there are 8 digits in each hand, the total maximum is 16. For there to be at least five 7s, my opponent would need to have all five or more 7s in their hand, which is highly improbable. Given the rarity of five 7s across both hands and my complete lack of 7s, challenging is the best strategic move.
