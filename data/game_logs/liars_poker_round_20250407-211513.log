Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have a '2' and a '7' in my hand. I'll bid on the digit '2' with a quantity of 3, assuming the other player might have at least one '2'. This bid is low enough to be safe but starts the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '23731145', I have two 3s. The current bid is 2 3s, which is fully covered by my own hand alone, meaning the total across both hands is at least 2, possibly more if the opponent has any 3s. Since the bid is very likely valid, challenging now would be unwise. The next strategic move is to increase the bid. I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same or higher quantity. A minimal safe raise is to bid 2 4s, since I have one 4, but that's risky. Alternatively, I can raise to 3 1s, because I have two 1s, and 1s are common, making it plausible there are at least three in total. This is a reasonable and safe raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is '3 1s'. To make a valid higher bid, I need to bid at least '4 1s' or any quantity of a higher digit. However, since I have no '1's in my hand, bidding '4 1s' is risky. Challenging the bid is also risky because the opponent might have the '1's. A safer move is to bid '2 2s' since I have two '2's in my hand, making it a more confident bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. The opponent could have up to 3 1s. It's unlikely they have 3 1s, so I will challenge the bid.
