Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s and one 6 in my hand. The current bid is None. I should start with a bid that's likely to be true based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '2 2s', I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Looking at my hand, 57030693, I see there are no 2s, but there are other digits that could potentially be bid upon. Since I have to bid higher, I could either increase the quantity or the digit. Noticing my hand contains a 3, and considering it's just one step above 2, bidding on 3s seems like a viable option. Given I have one 3 and it's possible the other player might have at least one, bidding '2 3s' seems reasonable and is a higher bid than '2 2s' because it increases the digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid is 2 3s, but I can increase the quantity to 3. I will make a bid with a higher quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 3 3s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Looking at my hand, 57030693, I have one 3, one 5, one 6, two 0s, one 9, and two 7s is not present but I do have other digits. Since I only have one 3, bidding higher on 3s is risky without knowing the other player's hand. However, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Noticing my hand, I have a couple of options to consider for bidding higher, either by increasing the quantity of a lower digit I have more of or moving to a higher digit. Given I don't have enough of any single digit to confidently increase the quantity significantly above 3 for digits like 0 or 9, my best bet is to consider moving to a higher digit that I have at least one of, like 5, 6, or 9. Among these, 5 and 6 are present once each, and 9 is also present once. Since I have to bid higher, moving to a higher digit seems like a safer strategy than trying to guess I have more of a lower digit than the other player. Thus, bidding on a digit I have, like 5, 6, or 9, with a quantity of 3 (since I don't have more than one of these and don't know the other player's hand) could be a good strategy, aiming for a digit that is higher than 3.

Player 1 bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s and two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s, I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit from 5 to 6, even with a lower quantity. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable.

Player 0 bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 3 6s, I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Looking at my hand, 57030693, I have one 6. Considering the bidding history, the bids have been increasing in digit or quantity. Since I only have one 6 and the bid is already at 3 6s, bidding higher on 6s seems risky without knowing the other player's hand. However, I can try to increase the quantity of a lower digit that I have more of, or match the quantity and increase the digit. I have two 3s and three 0s in my hand. Given this information, I could bid on a digit I have more of, but since the current bid is on 6s, I should either challenge or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity, which is not feasible with my hand. Challenging seems like a safer option given the uncertainty of the other player's hand and the fact that I only have one 6, which does not strongly support the current bid of 3 6s.
