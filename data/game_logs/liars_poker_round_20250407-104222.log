Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 9, 9, 1, 6, 0, 7, 3, 8, which includes one 0. Since the current bid is 1 0s, and I know I have one, the minimum total is 1, but there could be more in Player 0's hand. A safe and strategic move here is to increase the bid slightly to maintain pressure while not overcommitting. I will raise the bid to 2 0s, which is plausible given there are 16 digits in total and I already have one zero.
