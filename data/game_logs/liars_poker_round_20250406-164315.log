Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two 4s in my hand, I can start with a conservative bid that reflects my hand strength. Bidding 2 4s is a safe starting point as it matches the count in my hand and leaves room for the opponent to respond.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 4s in my hand. The opponent bid '2 4s', which means they believe there are at least 2 fours between our hands. Since I have zero 4s, they must have at least 2 in their hand for their bid to be valid. While this is possible, I have strong cards (two 5s, two 9s) that I can use to make a higher bid. Rather than challenging a relatively low and plausible bid, I'll bid '2 5s' - increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity. This is a safe bid since I can see two 5s in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s and one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s. Since I have one 5, there could be at least one more 5 in the opponent's hand, making the bid plausible. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or the digit. Given that I have two 4s, bidding 3 4s is a reasonable move, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I can see my entire hand (58179569) and there is no 4 in it. For the opponent's bid of '3 4s' to be true, they would need to have at least 3 fours in their hand since I have none. While possible, this seems unlikely given they started with a bid of '2 4s' and only raised it after I bid. They may be bluffing. The probability of having 3 or more of any specific digit in 8 random digits is relatively low. Given I know for certain there are 0 fours in my hand, I should challenge.
