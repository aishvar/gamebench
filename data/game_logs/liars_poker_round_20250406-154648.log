Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 2 9s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 9.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s. The current bid is 2 9s, which means the minimum number of 9s across both hands is claimed to be 2. Since I already hold two 9s myself, it's quite likely there are more in total, or at least the current bid is plausible. Challenging now would be risky. To make a safe higher bid, I can increase the quantity to 3 9s, which is likely since my two plus possibly one in the opponent's hand is reasonable.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are three 9s in total. Challenging seems like the best move.
