Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains 2 0s, 2 2s, 7 4s, 3 8s, and 4 9s. The current bid is None. I should start with a bid that is both a high quantity and a high digit, based on my hand's distribution.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my hand contains two 7s and a 9, and I know Player 0 has at least 7 9s (from their bid), I should consider the possibility of them having more 9s. However, given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and there are only 16 digits in total between both players, bidding 8 0s seems reasonable as it's a high digit and quantity that is hard for the opponent to beat, considering my hand and the possibility of Player 0 having more 9s but not necessarily more 0s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 8 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 0s. I have 2 0s in my hand. Bidding a higher quantity of 8 0s or the same quantity but a higher digit is not possible since 8 is the highest digit in the current bid. Therefore, I should bid a higher quantity of 9 0s, which is the next highest digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 9 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 0s. I have 3 zeros in my hand. Given that there are 16 digits in total and the bid history, I should consider if there's a high likelihood of the bid being true or not. Since I have 3 zeros and my opponent has already bid 7 9s and 9 0s, I should assess if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. The bid seems high but I do not have enough information about my opponent's hand. However, I can see that bidding a higher quantity with a higher digit might be risky without knowing the distribution. I will challenge the bid as it seems unlikely that there are 9 zeros in total, given that my hand and my opponent's previous bids do not suggest a high concentration of zeros.
