Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 30128917, which gives me two 1s. Bidding 2 1s seems safe because even if my opponent doesn't have any 1s, the total count will exactly meet my bid, and if they do, it only strengthens the bid. As the opening bid, it's modest and strategically solid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have a 1 in my hand, and I know there are 8 secret digits for each player, making 16 digits in total. Given that I have one 1 and assuming Player 0 might have one 1 as well (making at least 2 1s possible), bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. I will bid 3 1s to increase the quantity while targeting a low digit that could potentially exist in both hands.

Player 1 bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I know that in my hand I have two 1s, so the current bid of 3 1s is plausible since the opponent only needs one more 1 to reach 3. Challenging would only win if the opponent had no 1s (roughly a 43% chance), which isnâ€™t favorable. Instead, I want to continue the bidding with the minimal legal raise. The current bid is 3 1s, so the next bid in order is to keep the quantity at 3 while raising the digit from 1 to 2, even though I only hold one 2. This small step keeps me in the game while allowing room to maneuver in subsequent rounds.

Player 0 bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have a 2 in my hand, and I know there are 16 digits in total. Given that the bid is only 3 2s, and I have one 2, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. I can see if I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 2, if I bid higher on the same digit or switch to a higher digit, I might be able to make a valid higher bid. My hand contains a 6, which is higher than 2, and I can start with a low quantity to test the waters.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 2S'
Player 1 bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand (30128917) contains only one '2'. For the current bid of 4 2s to be valid, the opponent must have at least three 2s in their 8-digit hand, which is highly unlikely (roughly a 3-4% chance). Given this low probability, I believe challenging the bid is the safest option.
