Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, so I can safely bid at least 2 5s. Bidding 3 5s is a moderate risk since the opponent might have one, making the total three. This seems like a reasonable opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s, and it is plausible there are at least three 5s between both hands. However, I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity reasonable. I also have two 2s in my hand, so bidding 3 2s is a safe and strategic move to increase the digit while staying within realistic bounds.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand, which makes the current bid of 3 5s plausible but not overwhelmingly strong. To increase the bid, I can leverage the two 1s in my hand and bid 4 1s, as it is a higher quantity and shifts to a digit I have more of.
