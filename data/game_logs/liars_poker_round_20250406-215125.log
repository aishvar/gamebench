Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to start the bidding. I have a total of 8 digits in my hand, including a 4, 2, 3, and 9. To make a solid opening bid, I can choose a digit that I have multiple instances of. I have one 4, one 2, one 3, and one 9. I will bid 1 4, which is a reasonable starting point.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 9, 0, 6, 7, 9, 7, 7, 0. There are no 4s in my hand, making it less likely there are many 4s overall. The current bid is only 1 4s, which is quite conservative and very likely true since the opponent has 8 digits and it's probable they have at least one 4. Challenging now would likely lose. The best move is to increase the bid slightly with a digit I have multiple of, to keep the pressure on. I have three 7s, so a safe and strategic bid is 3 7s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4, one 2, and two 9s in my hand, but no 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, which seems high since I don't have any 7s and can't confirm their presence. Given that there are only 16 total digits, it's unlikely that there are 3 7s. Therefore, I should challenge the last bid.
