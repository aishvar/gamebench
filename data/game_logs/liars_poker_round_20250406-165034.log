--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 8, one 9, and one more 6. So, I have two 6s, and one of most other digits. Opening with a conservative but solid bid based on my hand would be 2 6s, reflecting the two 6s I hold. This is a safe opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. I could bid 3 of any digit. I'll bid 3 0s, as 0 is a less likely digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (46309682), I have two 0s. The current bid is 3 0s, so unless the opponent has at least one 0, the bid would be invalid. Since it's quite plausible the opponent has at least one 0 in their 8 digits, challenging now is risky. To continue safely, I can raise the bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have two 6s, so bidding 3 6s is reasonable, as it's likely there are at least three 6s across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. I could bid higher, but I don't want to overcommit. Since the bid is only 3, and there are 16 total digits, it's plausible the previous player is bluffing. I will challenge.
