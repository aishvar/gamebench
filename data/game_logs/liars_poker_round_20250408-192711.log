Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 52745171, which gives me two 7s. Knowing that I already have two 7s in play makes bidding 2 7s a safe and conservative opening move. This bid is credible because it’s guaranteed by my hand and leaves room for the possibility that my opponent might also have a 7.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, which already matches the current bid of 2 7s. It is likely that Player 0 also has at least one 7, making the total count at least 3 or higher. To stay in the game and escalate the bidding, I will bid 3 7s, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s, and I hold two 7s in my hand. This means that for the bid to be correct, the opponent must have at least one 7 among their 8 unknown digits – a probability of roughly 57% (since the chance of them having no 7 is about (0.9)^8 ≈ 43%). Bidding higher (for example, raising to 4 7s or bidding on another digit) would force the opponent to supply an even greater number of that digit, which is statistically even less likely given my hand. Therefore, challenging the current bid gives me a higher probability of catching a bluff.
