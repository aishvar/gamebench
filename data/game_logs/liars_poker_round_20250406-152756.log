Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (93748224), I count the occurrences of each digit: 9 (1), 3 (1), 7 (1), 4 (1), 8 (1), 2 (2), 4 (1). The most frequent digit in my hand is 2 (2 occurrences) and 4 (2 occurrences). A reasonable starting bid should be conservative and based on the information I have. Bidding 2 2s seems like a safe start as it reflects the frequency of one of the more common digits in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 56338656, I have no 2s, so the current bid of 2 2s relies entirely on the opponent's hand. Since they have 8 digits, it's plausible they might have two 2s, so challenging now is risky. To make a safe higher bid, I should consider a digit I have multiple of. I have three 6s, so bidding 3 6s is a natural and safe increase, both raising the quantity and switching to a digit I hold strongly.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 (from 93748224) in my hand, so I know that there is at least one 6 in my hand and potentially more in the opponent's hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I have no information about other digits in my opponent's hand, I'll increase the quantity. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it is a higher quantity than the current bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand (digits: 5,6,3,3,8,6,5,6). The current bid is 4 6s, which means there must be at least one 6 in Player 0's hand to make the bid valid. This is plausible, so challenging now is risky. The next valid bid would be either 5 6s or 4 7s. Since I only have three 6s, betting on 5 6s would require Player 0 to have at least two 6s, which is somewhat unlikely but possible. Alternatively, raising to 4 7s requires there to be four 7s total, but I have zero 7s, making that less likely. Therefore, the safer strategic move is to bid 5 6s, pushing the pressure back on Player 0.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I had previously bid 4 6s, so I know there are at least 4 sixes. My hand is 93748224, which contains one 2 and no 6s. Given that I have 8 digits and there are 16 total digits, my lack of 6s suggests that the other player might have a significant number of 6s. However, bidding higher than 5 6s requires a reasonable expectation. I can bid 6 6s, slightly increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could challenge if I think the bid is too high. Since I don't have any 6s, and my hand doesn't provide evidence for or against the bid, I'll cautiously increase the bid to 6 6s, as it's still below the maximum possible quantity of 16 and not an extreme bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have four 6s (digits: 5,6,3,3,8,6,5,6). The current bid is 6 6s, which means there must be at least two more 6s in my opponent's hand of 8 digits. While possible, it is somewhat unlikely that my opponent holds 2 or more 6s, as that would mean half their hand is 6s. Since the bid is already quite high and I have a strong count of 6s myself, challenging here is statistically favorable.
