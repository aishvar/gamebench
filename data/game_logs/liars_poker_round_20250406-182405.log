Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 25147524, I have: two 2s, two 5s, one each of 1,4,7. Since this is the opening bid and I have two 5s, bidding three 5s is a reasonable starting point - it suggests there's just one more 5 among the opponent's eight digits, which is quite possible. Starting with a moderate bid allows room for the bidding to develop.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 31690372, I have no 5s. Since there are 8 digits in my opponent's hand, and I hold zero 5s, the bid of 3 5s relies entirely on them having at least 3 out of 8 digits as 5s, which is unlikely. Statistically, the expected number of 5s per player is about 0.8 (since each digit 0-9 is equally likely). Therefore, 3 total 5s is a high estimate given my zero count. Challenging here is the best move.
