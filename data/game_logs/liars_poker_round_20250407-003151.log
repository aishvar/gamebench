--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 2 8s establishes a high digit early, making it difficult to challenge since my own count matches the bid. This forces the opponent to either raise the quantity or choose a higher digit (which I don't have), balancing risk and control.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, which means there must be at least one 8 in Player 0's hand. Since I have no 8s, the total count of 8s can only be 1 or 2. Bidding 3 8s would be a lie, so I should challenge the current bid.
