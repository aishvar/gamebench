Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (72340263), I have two 2s, one 3, two 0s, one 4, one 6, and one 7. Since this is the opening bid, I want to make a conservative bid based on what I know for certain. Two 2s in my hand makes '2 2s' a safe opening bid, as it's guaranteed to exist and leaves room for higher bids.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (67989281), I have no 2s. Since the current bid is only 2 2s, with 16 total digits, it's quite plausible my opponent has two 2s, or there might be one in their hand and a miscount. Challenging now is risky. To stay safe and increase pressure, I should make a minimal valid raise. I will bid 2 3s, which is a higher digit but same quantity, and since I have one 3 in my hand, it's a reasonable conservative bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand (72340263). The current bid of '2 3s' is relatively low given there are 16 total digits in play. Based on my hand, I know there's at least one 3, and it's quite likely the opponent has at least one more 3. I could challenge, but it's too risky this early in the game with such a low bid. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Since I have two 6s in my hand, I'll bid '2 6s', keeping the same quantity but using a higher digit that I'm confident about.

Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 67989281, I have one 6. Since the current bid is 2 6s, and I hold one, it's quite plausible that there is at least one 6 in the opponent's hand, making the bid reasonable. To increase, I can either bid 2 7s or 3 0s (or any digit). Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s is a safe and credible way to raise the quantity, leveraging my strong count of 8s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 72340263, I only see zero 8s. The opponent bid '3 8s', claiming there are at least 3 eights total. Since I have none, this means all 3 would need to be in their hand, which is possible but risky for them to claim. I could bid higher, but given I have no 8s to support their claim and it's relatively early in the game, challenging seems like the safer play.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
