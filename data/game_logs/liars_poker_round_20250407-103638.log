Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 0s, two 3s, one 2, one 4, and one 5 and one 7. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 9s, reflecting the two 9s I hold, which is conservative but credible.
