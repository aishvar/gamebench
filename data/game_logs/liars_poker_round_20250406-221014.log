Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so any bid is valid. I have two 6s and two 5s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 6.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. My hand has no 6s, so the opponent must have at least 3 to validate the bid. By bidding 3 9s, I raise the digit to a higher value (9 > 6) while maintaining the same quantity. I hold two 9s, requiring only one more from the opponent's hand, which is plausible.

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have two 6s in my hand, which means there are at least two 6s in play. Since the opponent bid 3 9s, it's likely they have at least one 9. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable next step, as it increases the digit and maintains the quantity, leveraging the 6s in my hand. Challenging seems risky because the opponent might have a 9.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s. Bidding 4 9s increases the digit while keeping the same quantity, which is valid. Since Player 0 didn't challenge my previous 3 9s bid, they might have at least one 9, making the total count of 9s potentially four or more.

Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have two 6s in my hand, which means there are at least 4 6s in play. Bidding 5 6s is a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity while keeping the same digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. My hand has zero 6s, so the opponent must have at least five. While possible (they could have five or more in their 8-digit hand), the bid progression suggests potential bluffing. Challenging is risky but statistically plausible since five 6s in a single hand is less likely than a lower count.
