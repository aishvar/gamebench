Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can make the first bid. My hand is 56152923. I see that I have one 5 and one 9. A reasonable starting bid could be to bid on a digit I have. Since I have two relatively high digits, I can start with a bid that reflects a conservative estimate. Bidding '2 5s' seems reasonable as it is a low quantity and I have one 5 in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand (49025698). The current bid is 2 5s, which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 2 fives across all players' hands. Since I have 1 five, this bid seems quite reasonable - we would only need 1 more five among the other 16 digits held by Players 0 and 2. I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, one 6, one 8, one 4, one 0, and one 2. I could bid on 9s since I have two of them, but I'll be conservative and increase the current bid slightly. I'll bid 3 5s, suggesting there are at least 3 fives total, which is certainly possible even though I only have 1.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have a 5 and a 6 in my hand, but no information about other players' hands. Given that I have one 5, I can reasonably assume that there might be more 5s or other digits in other players' hands. I will increase the quantity and digit slightly to 4 6s, as it's a reasonable assumption that there could be at least 4 sixes in total across all players' hands, considering the distribution of digits.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 with the same digit (6s) seems reasonable because I know that there are at least 3 other 6s out there (since Player 2 bid 4 6s). Bidding 5 6s is a relatively safe bet. Alternatively, bidding 4 7s is also a valid move, but given that I have no information about 7s in my hand or others, I will stick with increasing the quantity of 6s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (49025698). The current bid is 5 6s. So far, I know there's at least one 6 (mine), and Player 2 likely has some 6s since they bid 4 6s. Player 0 raised to 5 6s, which suggests they might have at least one 6 as well. Given that I have one 6, and the other players likely have some 6s based on their bidding, 5 6s seems reasonable. I could bid 6 6s, but I'm not confident enough. I could also switch to a different digit like 9s (I have one 9) or 8s (I have one 8), but I'd need to bid at least 5 of them. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, which is promising. I'll bid 5 7s, increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid can be beaten. My hand contains the digits 3, 6, 3, 4, 1, 6, 5, and 6. I have a total of 2 sixes and other digits that could potentially add up to make a higher bid. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and there are already 5 7s bid, I should consider if I can safely make a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, so I know there are at least 2 6s. The total count of 6s across all players is at least 2 (mine) + 1 (assumed from Player 1 or Player 2's previous bids, as Player 2 bid 4 6s and then 6 6s). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity and increase the digit. Bidding 7 6s is a reasonable increase in quantity. Alternatively, bidding 6 7s is also valid as it increases the digit. Given that Player 1 bid 5 7s previously, there are likely several 7s. I will bid 6 7s, matching the quantity and increasing the digit, as it seems more plausible given the previous bid by Player 1.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current state carefully. In my hand (49025698), I have only one 7. The current bid is '6 7s', meaning Player 0 claims there are at least 6 sevens among all players. For this to be true, there would need to be 5 more 7s between the other two players. While possible, this seems somewhat high given that each digit appears 2.4 times on average across all hands (24 total digits รท 10 possible values). I also notice that Player 0 has been aggressive in raising bids, going from '2 5s' to '5 6s' to '6 7s'. I could bid '6 8s' or '7 0s', but with only one 8 and one 0 in my hand, that's risky. Given that I have only one 7 and the bid of 6 seems high for this digit, challenging is the safer move.
