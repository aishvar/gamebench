Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s and two 2s in my hand. Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 2 3s is a reasonable starting point, as it reflects the count in my hand and leaves room for the opponent to bid higher.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 2 3s. Bidding 2 9s is a valid higher bid because 9 is a higher digit than 3. Since I already have two 9s, the total count is at least 2, making this a safe bid that forces the opponent to either challenge (which would fail) or bid a higher quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, but the current bid is only 2 9s. Given that the opponent has 8 digits, it's possible they have at least two 9s. However, since I have two 3s in my hand, I can make a safer bid by increasing the quantity and keeping the digit low.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s. Bidding 3 9s increases the digit while maintaining the quantity, leveraging my strong 9s. The opponent might have at least one 9 given the total 16 digits, making this a safer bid than challenging, which risks the opponent having exactly two 3s (total 3).

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 9s. Given that there are only 16 total digits in play, it's unlikely that Player 1 has three 9s unless they have all three in their hand. Since I have none, I think it's reasonable to challenge this bid.
