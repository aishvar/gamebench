Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains two 6s and two 5s. I should start with a conservative bid to gauge the game. Bidding 2 5s seems reasonable as it's a low quantity and a low digit, allowing me to test the waters without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s, which is possible but not guaranteed with my single 5. To make a higher bid, I can increase the quantity to 3 5s, assuming there might be another 5 in the other player's hand. This is a reasonable increase based on the current bid and my hand.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have two 5s in my hand, and I know that Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bid 3 5s. Given that I have two 5s and the opponent has at least 3 5s (from their bid), I should consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since my hand contains two 5s and I do not know the exact distribution of digits in the opponent's hand, I should think about making a valid higher bid or challenging if the bid seems unlikely. The bid of 3 5s seems plausible but I need to increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 5s and other digits that could potentially be higher. A bid of 4 6s seems reasonable as I have two 6s in my hand and it increases both the quantity and digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 6s. With only 16 total digits in play, it's unlikely there are 4 or more 6s. I should challenge the bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
