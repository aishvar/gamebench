Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding with a reasonable starting bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 5s, one 3, one 4, one 9, and one 0. A common opening bid is 2 of a digit I have multiples of. I'll open with '2 7s' because I hold two 7s myself, making it likely that there are at least two 7s in total and possibly more in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. It's possible there are at least two 7s in total. However, I can safely bid higher by increasing the quantity to 3 and choosing a low digit like 0, as I have one 0 in my hand. This makes it a slightly safer bid.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 7, 3, 4, 9, 0, 7, 5, 6. I have exactly one 0. The current bid is 3 zeros, so for that to be valid, my opponent would need at least two zeros. While possible, it's not overly likely. However, bidding 3 1s or 3 2s is a minimal raise, but I can also raise the quantity. Given that I have two 7s, a safe and stronger bid would be 3 7s, which is higher than 3 0s (same quantity, higher digit), and aligns with my hand strength. This keeps the pressure on without overcommitting.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. It's possible there are at least three 7s in total. I could bid higher, but with only one 7 in my hand, I'm not confident. I will challenge to see if the previous player was bluffing.
