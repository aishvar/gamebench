Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand. Since it's the first bid, I can choose any quantity and digit. Bidding 4 1s is reasonable, assuming the opponent might have one or two 1s, making the total count plausible.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand (49875233) contains no 1s, meaning any 1s must come solely from the opponent's 8 digits. The probability that the opponentâ€™s hand contains 4 or more 1s is extremely low (roughly around 0.5%). Given this information, the current bid of '4 1s' seems highly unlikely to be true, so I should challenge it.
