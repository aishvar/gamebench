Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 2 6s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 6 as well.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid than the current 2 6s, as it increases both quantity and digit. This is a confident move given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have a 7 in my hand, making it possible that there are 3 7s in total. However, I also have a 6 in my hand. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move because it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid, and it's likely that there are at least four 6s in total across both hands.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have four 7s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s. Bidding 4 7s is a valid higher bid since it increases the digit. Given I have four 7s, the total count is likely at least four.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are four 7s in total, as the other player would have had to have at least three 7s in their hand to make this bid. Therefore, I should challenge this bid.
