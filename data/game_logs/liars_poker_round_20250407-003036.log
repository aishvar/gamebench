--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 1s. Since I only have one 1, it's unlikely that there are three 1s in total. However, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity to 4 and choosing a digit I have more of, such as 4s or 6s. I have two 6s, so bidding 4 6s seems reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, which is a safe increase. However, since I have a 6, bidding 5 6s is also reasonable and slightly more strategic.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 6s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. Since I only have two 6s, bidding 6 6s would be risky. Instead, I can bid 5 7s, increasing the digit while maintaining the same quantity. This seems reasonable based on my hand and the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. It's possible there are at least five 7s in total, but it's also possible that the other player is bluffing. I could bid higher, but I'm not confident enough to bid a significantly higher quantity. I will challenge to see if they are bluffing.
