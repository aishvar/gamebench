Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. I have 8 digits: 27495431. This includes one 1, one 2, one 3, two 4s, one 5, one 7, and one 9. There are 16 total digits in play (2 players * 8 digits). The average number of any specific digit is 1.6. Since I have two 4s, it's statistically likely there are more 4s in the opponent's hand. Bidding '3 4s' is a reasonable opening bid, leveraging my strongest digit count (two 4s) and assuming the opponent has at least one 4, which is plausible.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 4s, so the current bid of 3 4s relies entirely on the opponent's hand, which is possible but uncertain. Looking at my digits, I have two 5s and one 9, which gives me a stronger basis to increase the bid. Since raising to 3 5s is a higher digit but same quantity, it's a valid higher bid. This keeps the pressure on the opponent while still being plausible given my hand.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand (27495431). This means the bid requires the opponent (Player 1) to have at least two 5s among their 8 digits. This is a plausible scenario for a low bid like 3. Challenging seems risky. My previous bid was 3 4s, and I have two 4s. Escalating to 4 4s is a reasonable next step. This bid requires at least two 4s from the opponent's hand, which is statistically similar in likelihood to the opponent having two 5s. It leverages my hand strength in 4s and forces the opponent to make a decision on a credible bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 4S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 4s at all. The current bid is 4 4s, which would require at least 4 of that digit across both hands. Since I hold zero, Player 0 would need to have all 4 or more 4s alone, which is quite unlikely given only 8 digits per player. Statistically, expecting 4 or more 4s in one hand is improbable. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
