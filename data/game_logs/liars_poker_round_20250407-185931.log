Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player, I need to make an opening bid. Analyzing my hand '02043128', I have two 0s, one 1, one 2, two 2s, one 3, one 4, and one 8. The most frequent digits in my hand are '0' and '2', each appearing twice. Since there is no prior bid, I will start with a conservative but reasonable opening bid on the digit I have multiple of. Choosing '2' with a quantity of 2 is a solid start, as I already hold two 2s, and it's likely that at least one more exists in the opponent's hand, making this a safe initial bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have the digits 7,6,5,9,9,5,2,6. The total number of 2s across both hands is 1 (from my hand) plus whatever Player 0 has. Since Player 0 bid 2 2s, they might have at least one 2. The maximum possible 2s is 16, but it's unlikely to have more than 2. I think the bid is valid and decide to challenge it.
