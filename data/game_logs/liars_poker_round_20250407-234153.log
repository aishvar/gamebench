Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid of 2 6s is safe because even if the opponent has no 6s, the total count (2) meets the bid. This establishes a baseline while leveraging my existing hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, but I do have three 8s. The current bid is only 2 6s, which is relatively low. To increase the bid strategically, I can bid 3 8s based on my hand, as I know I already have enough 8s to support this bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand. The opponent's bid of 3 8s requires them to have all three 8s in their own hand. Given the low probability of holding three 8s in an 8-card hand and the strategic tendency to bluff with high digits, challenging this bid is statistically favorable.
