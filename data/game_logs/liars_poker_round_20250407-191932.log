Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits: 2, 1, 0, 5, 6, 2, 4, 7. The counts are: two 2s, one 0, one 1, one 5, one 6, one 4, one 7. A good opening bid typically references a digit I have at least once, preferably more than once. I have two 2s, so bidding '2 2s' is a reasonable and safe opening bid, reflecting my hand strength and setting a baseline that is believable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (99615847), I see I have three 9s, two 1s are not present but I do have other digits. The current bid is '2 2s'. To make a valid higher bid, I must exceed the quantity of 2 or the digit 2. I have a total of 8 digits in my hand, and none of them are 2s, so bidding higher on 2 is not possible for me. However, I can bid on a digit that I know exists in my hand. I see I have three 9s, which is a higher quantity than the current bid of 2. Since the maximum possible quantity is 16 and my hand contains three 9s, I can confidently bid on 9s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 nines. Looking at my hand (21056247), I have zero 9s. Since I hold none, for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need to have all 3 or more 9s in their hand of 8 digits. The probability of having 3 or more of a specific digit in just 8 digits is quite low, especially since I have none. Therefore, it's unlikely that there are at least 3 nines combined. Challenging is the best strategic move here.
