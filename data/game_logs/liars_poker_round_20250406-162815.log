Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one of each digit from 2 to 9, with no zeros or ones. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 6s, as I have one 6 and it's likely the opponent has at least one 6 as well among their 8 digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s. Since I have one 6, it's possible that the other player has at least one 6, making the current bid valid. However, bidding higher than 2 6s seems risky without more information. Challenging the bid is also risky because there is a chance the other player has at least one 6. Therefore, I will bid 3 1s, increasing the quantity and using a digit I know I have.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains no 1s, making it unlikely that there are 3 or more 1s across both hands. Given that I have 8 digits and none are 1s, Player 1 would need to hold all 3 or more 1s themselves, which is improbable. Therefore, challenging the current bid is strategically sound.
