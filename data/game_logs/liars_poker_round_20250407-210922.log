Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, the most frequent digits are 9, 8, 7, 5, 2, 1, 0, and 4, each appearing exactly once. A common opening strategy is to bid on a digit you have, typically starting conservatively with a count of 2, since with 16 digits total, it's very likely at least 2 of any digit exist. I will select '2' of digit '9', which I hold, as it's a strong and safe opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. Looking at my hand (28910214), I have one '9'. For the bid to be valid, there must be at least two 9s across both hands. Since I hold one 9, the opponent needs to have at least one 9 for the bid to be valid. This is quite plausible, as the probability that the opponent has at least one 9 in their 8 digits is reasonably high. Therefore, challenging now is risky. A safe and minimal higher bid would be to increase the digit while keeping the count the same, for example, 2 of a digit higher than 9, but since 9 is the highest digit, I must increase the quantity instead. So, the next minimal valid bid is 3 of any digit. I will bid 3 1s, since I have two 1s in my hand, making it more likely that this bid is valid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 ones. Looking at my hand (98752104), I have only one '1'. For the bid of 3 ones to be valid, the opponent must have at least 2 more ones. Since each player has 8 digits, it's statistically unlikely that the opponent has 2 or more ones, especially since I only have 1 myself. The probability of the opponent having 2 or more ones is relatively low, making the bid suspicious. Therefore, the optimal move is to challenge the current bid.
