Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. The current bid is 1 0s, which is easily met by my own hand alone, so challenging would be unwise. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since I have three 3s and two 4s, a reasonable next bid is 2 3s, as it increases the quantity and is supported by my hand.
