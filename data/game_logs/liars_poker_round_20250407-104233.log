Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s, two 4s, two 0s, one 1, and one 3. Since the current bid is only 1 0s and I already hold two 0s, it's very safe to increase the bid. A natural higher bid would be 2 0s, which is strictly higher than 1 0s and well-supported by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 71437470, I have two 7s, two 4s, two 0s, one 1, and one 3. The current bid is 2 1s, and since I only have one 1, for that bid to be valid, the opponent would need at least one 1, which is plausible. Rather than challenge a modest bid, a better strategy is to raise on a digit I hold strongly. I have two 7s, so a reasonable next bid is 2 7s, which is strictly higher than 2 1s because the digit is higher with the same quantity. This keeps pressure on the opponent while leveraging my strong count of 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 2 8s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 7, 1, 4, 3, 7, 4, 7, 0. I have three 7s, zero 8s, and one 0. The current bid is 2 8s. Since I have no 8s, the opponent would need at least 2 8s alone for the bid to be valid. The probability that Player 0 holds two or more 8s in their 8 digits is relatively low (about 14% chance). Given this low likelihood, it's a good opportunity to challenge the bid.
