--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid of two 1s is safe because the minimum possible total (from my hand alone) meets the bid. This forces the opponent to either bid higher or challenge a guaranteed valid claim.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 4, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6, 1, 4, which includes one '1'. The current bid is 2 1s, so for that bid to be valid, there must be at least one more '1' in Player 0's hand. Since there's a reasonable chance they have at least one '1', challenging now is risky. The safest move is to make a minimal higher bid. I will raise to 2 2s, which is a strictly higher bid with the same quantity but a higher digit, and it's conservative without overcommitting.
