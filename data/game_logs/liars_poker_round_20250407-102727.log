--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 2 8s is safe since the total count must be at least 2 (my two 8s). This bid uses a high digit (8), limiting the opponent's ability to overbid with a higher digit at the same quantity. If challenged, the minimum count is already met, ensuring a win.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s (digits: 9, 6, 8, 0, 2, 7, 0, 1). Since the current bid is 2 8s and I already hold two, it's quite likely there could be more in the opponent's hand. Challenging now would be risky. To stay in the game, the minimal valid higher bid is 2 9s, which slightly increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 3 4s increases the quantity from the current bid (2 9s) while leveraging my existing 4s. Given the opponent's unknown hand, there's a reasonable probability they have at least one 4, making 3 total 4s achievable.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 4S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 96802701, I have one 4. The current bid is 3 4s, so at least two 4s would need to be in the opponent's hand to make that bid valid. This is plausible, but not guaranteed. However, since I have two 0s, bidding 3 5s or 3 6s wouldn't increase the quantity, just the digit, which is a minimal raise. Instead, I can make a stronger bid by increasing the quantity. I also have two 0s, so bidding 4 0s would be reasonable, as it only requires the opponent to have two 0s, which is likely. Therefore, I will bid 4 0s to increase the quantity and digit relevance based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, meaning the opponent's 8-digit hand must contain all 4 zeros claimed in their bid. Given the bid history escalation (Player 1 jumped from 2 9s to 4 0s after my 3 4s), this aggressive switch to a lower digit with higher quantity suggests a possible bluff. Holding zero 0s myself, it's statistically unlikely the opponent has exactly 4 zeros in their 8-card hand. Challenging here offers better odds than making a speculative bid requiring opponent cooperation.
