--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 3s, one 2, one 6, one 7, and one 4. The most frequent digit is 8 or 3 with two occurrences each. A conservative opening bid is to claim 2 of one of these digits, which is very likely to be true, but to increase pressure, I will start with 3 of a digit I have multiples of. Given that I have two 8s, it's plausible there are at least three 8s in total across both hands, so I will open with '3 8s'.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, requiring at least two more 8s in the opponent's hand. Statistically, the probability of the opponent having two or more 8s is low (~18.7%), making a challenge favorable. Challenging now has a high likelihood of success as the total 8s would likely be less than 3.
