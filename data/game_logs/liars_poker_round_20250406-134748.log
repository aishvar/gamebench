--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 3s, and bidding 2 3s seems like a reasonable starting point, as it's based on my actual digits and not too high to be unbelievable.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 3s, so the current bid of 2 3s relies entirely on Player 0 holding at least two 3s, which is plausible but not certain. However, since 2 is a conservative opening bid, challenging now is risky. Instead, I can comfortably raise the bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have two 6s, so bidding 2 6s is safe and strategically better.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains one 6, and I have a total of 8 digits. I can see if my digits can form a higher quantity or a higher digit. Since the current bid is 2 6s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I have a 6 in my hand, so I can try to bid higher on the same digit or a different one. A bid of 3 6s seems reasonable as I have one 6 and can try to increase the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand (digits: 56842660). The current bid is 3 6s, which matches exactly my count, so it's plausible but risky to assume there are more. Since the total number of 6s across both hands would need to be at least 3 for the current bid to be valid, and I hold all three, it's unlikely the opponent has any additional 6s. Therefore, raising the bid further would be risky, and challenging now is the best option.
