Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid is None, I can make any bid. I have a 3 in my hand, which is the highest digit I'm certain about. I'll start by bidding a reasonable quantity of 1 3s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 3s. Since the current bid is only 1 3s, I can confidently raise the bid to 2 3s, knowing that there are at least two 3s in total. This is a safe and strategic increase.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have a 3 in my hand. Given the bid history and my hand, I should increase the quantity and digit to make a more assertive claim. I'll bid 3 4s, increasing both quantity and digit, making it a more challenging bid for the other player to meet.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 4S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 3s and one 4. The current bid is 3 4s, meaning there must be at least three 4s across both hands. Since I only hold one 4, Player 0 would need to have at least two more 4s, which is somewhat unlikely but possible. However, I am confident there are at least three 3s total because I hold two myself, so a safe higher bid would be 3 5s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have 4 fives in my hand, which is more than the current bid. I can make a higher bid by increasing both the quantity and the digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 2, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0, 3, 3. I have zero 5s, which means the opponent would need to have all 4 or more 5s to make the current bid of 4 5s valid. This is unlikely given typical digit distribution. Since I have none, the probability that there are at least 4 total 5s is low, so challenging is the best move.
