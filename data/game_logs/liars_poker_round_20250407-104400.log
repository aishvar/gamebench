Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 7s, two 9s, one 2, and one 5. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 7s, reflecting my two 7s, which is likely safe and leaves room to maneuver in future rounds.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s (digits: 8,9,2,7,8,5,9,7). The current bid is 2 8s, which I already fully cover, making it plausible that there are more 8s in total. Given the total of 16 digits, it's quite reasonable to think there might be at least 3 8s. Therefore, I will increase the bid by quantity to 3 8s to apply pressure and maintain a safe position based on my hand.
