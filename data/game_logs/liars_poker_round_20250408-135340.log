Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. I have two 8s in my hand, which is a strong starting point. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable, as it increases both the quantity and the digit based on my hand, and it's a plausible count considering the total number of digits in play.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one '8'. The opponent's bid is '3 8s', meaning they likely have at least two '8s' themselves or are bluffing. With 16 total digits in play, having at least three '8s' is plausible. Without strong evidence against this bid, challenging seems risky. To continue safely, I can make a slightly higher bid. My hand has multiple '5s' (digits: 3,5,3,6,5,2,8,9), specifically two '5s'. It's reasonable to assume at least two more '5s' exist in the opponent's hand, totaling at least four '5s'. Therefore, bidding '4 5s' is a sensible and safe move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s, which means there must be at least three more 5s in the other player's hand to make the total four. Given that I only have one 5, it's unlikely the other player has three 5s. Bidding higher seems risky, so challenging is the safer option.
