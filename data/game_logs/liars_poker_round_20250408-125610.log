Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, making it likely that there are several 8s in total. Since there is no current bid, starting with a conservative bid of 3 8s seems safe and reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 67882345, which contains two 8s. Previously, I bid 3 8s, indicating confidence in the number of 8s. The opponent bid 3 9s, possibly without strong evidence. Given that I already have two 8s, bidding 4 8s seems reasonable, as it's more likely there are at least two more 8s in the opponent's hand or at least a safer increment than bidding higher digits without evidence.
