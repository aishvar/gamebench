Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s, which is very low. I have 8 digits in my hand, and 0 is one of them. I should make a bid that takes into account my hand and the current bid. I have 4 zeros in my hand, so bidding 5 0s seems reasonable.
