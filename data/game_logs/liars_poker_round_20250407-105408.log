Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without needing to challenge. I see I have two 7s and two 6s. A reasonable starting bid could be 2 6s or 2 7s, as these are the highest quantities I can confidently claim based on my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. I should increase the quantity but keep the digit the same to make a valid higher bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have a total of 8 digits in my hand: 2, 6, 4, 1, 6, 3, 7, 7. I can see that I have two 7s and two 6s. My goal is to make a bid that is higher than the current bid of 3 7s. Since I have two 7s, I can confidently say that there are at least 4 7s in total if I include Player 1's hand. However, I also need to consider that my bid must be strictly higher than the current bid. I can bid 4 7s or higher quantity with a lower digit, or same quantity with a higher digit. Given that I have two 6s and the current bid is 3 7s, I can try to bid higher with a different digit. I have two 6s and two 7s are already accounted for in the previous bids, so bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it's higher than 3 7s and I have the digits to support it.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have 3 digits in my hand that are greater than 6. However, I only have one 6. Bidding 5 6s seems like a safe bet, as it's only one more than the current bid and it's a digit I have.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more likely to succeed. My hand contains a 6 and several other digits. Given that the previous bid was also 5 6s and I have a 6 in my hand, I should consider if I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should look for a digit that appears multiple times in my hand or a higher digit than 6. My hand contains two 6s and other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have a 6 in my hand. Bidding 7 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 7 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, and I know there are 8 digits in total (4 from each player). Given that the previous bids have already established a significant number of 6s, I should consider if I can reasonably increase the bid or challenge it. Since I have two 6s and the bid history shows an increasing number of 6s, I should assess if there's a high likelihood that there are indeed 7 or more 6s in total. If not, I should challenge. However, my hand does not have enough 6s to guarantee a win if I challenge, but I do have other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. I notice I have two 7s, which could be a safer bet given the history of 6s being bid. I will increase the quantity and digit to make a valid higher bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 8 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 7s. I have a 7 in my hand. Bidding 9 7s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on the current bid and my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 9 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 7s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains a 7 and several other digits. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are 8 secret digits per player, I should assess the likelihood of there being 9 or more 7s in total. Given that I have one 7 and assuming Player 1 has a reasonable distribution, it's possible they have a few 7s but unlikely they have 9 or more. I will challenge the bid as it seems high.
