Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 68278409. I see that I have two 8s, one 7, one 6, one 4, one 2, and one 9. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and a conservative estimate of the total count of a digit. Since I have two 8s, bidding on 8s seems reasonable. I'll start with a bid of 3 8s, assuming that the other players might have at least one 8 between them.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. It's unlikely there are at least three 8s total. However, bidding 4 8s would be a very risky bluff, and I don't have enough 8s to reliably support it. Bidding a different digit seems safer. I have two 4s. Bidding 4 4s is a valid increase in quantity and could be plausible. A higher digit with the same quantity would also be valid, but I don't have enough of a higher digit to make a strong bid. Therefore, I will bid 4 4s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 4 4s, which means there would need to be at least three more 4s among the other two players' hands. Given that there are 16 other digits in play, this seems plausible but not certain. To be safe, I will make a higher bid based on my hand, which has two 2s. Bidding 4 6s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, so I know there are at least 2 6s. The bid of 4 6s is plausible because it's possible the other players have the remaining 2 6s needed to meet the bid. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 8 in my hand and previously Player 0 bid 3 8s, I can bid higher than 4 6s by bidding 4 7s or higher quantity with 6s or lower digits. Bidding 4 7s seems reasonable as it increases the digit.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 7s is necessary. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 7s is a possibility, but could be risky. Increasing the digit to 4 8s is also possible. Since I have a 8 in my hand, I'll bid 4 8s. This is a reasonable bid, increasing the digit while maintaining the quantity.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which seems high given that there are only 24 digits in total across all players. The probability of there being at least four 8s is low, especially since I don't have any. Challenging the bid is the best move.
