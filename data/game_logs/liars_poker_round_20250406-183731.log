--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 4s, one 5, one 1, one 8, and one 9. The most frequent digits in my hand are 0 and 4 with two occurrences each. A safe opening bid is usually 2 of a digit I have multiple of, so I'll start with '2 4s' to reflect that.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand, which allows me to make a higher bid than the current 2 4s. Bidding 3 7s increases the quantity, making it a valid and strategic move based on my known cards.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 0, 8, 4, 5, 1, 0, 4, 9, which contain zero 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, implying at least three 7s across both hands. Since I have none, the opponent would need all three or more, which is unlikely given only 8 digits in their hand. The probability of them holding three or more 7s is low, so challenging is the best move.
