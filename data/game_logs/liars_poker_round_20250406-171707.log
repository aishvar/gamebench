Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without worrying about being too high. I have one 6 in my hand. Starting with a low bid seems reasonable.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 2 6s is a safe increase and likely valid.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 6s, so I know there are at least 2 sixes in total. Given that the previous bid was also 2 6s and I have more than 2 sixes is unlikely, I should bid higher than 2 but not necessarily higher than 6 since there are only 16 digits in play. A reasonable next bid could be 3 6s or higher, considering I have two 6s and it's a valid higher quantity.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. It's plausible that there are at least three 6s in total. However, since I only have one, I don't want to bid too high. I will bid 4 6s, increasing the quantity by 1.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s, made by Player 1. I have two 6s in my hand, and the bid history shows an increasing quantity of 6s. Given that I have two 6s and the bid is already at 4 6s, I should consider if I can reasonably increase the bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge if unlikely, I should assess if there's a possibility that the total count of 6s is indeed 4 or more. With my two 6s, if Player 1 has two or more 6s, the total would be 4 or more. However, I have no information that they have more than two 6s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are 8 secret digits per player, I should consider increasing the bid slightly to test the validity of Player 1's claim or challenge if I think it's unlikely.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding higher than 5 6s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. I could bid 6 0s, but that seems weak. I could bid 6 6s, which is more reasonable given I have one 6. However, since the bidding has been going up by one 6 each time, it's possible my opponent is bluffing. Given I only have one 6, I'm not confident there are at least 6 total. I'll challenge.
