Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. Given there are 16 digits total, it's quite likely there is at least one more 0 in Player 0's hand, making the current bid of 1 0s reasonable. To make a strictly higher bid, I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 4s and two 9s, bidding 2 4s or 2 9s is safe and increases the quantity from 1 to 2, which is a valid higher bid. Choosing 2 9s leverages my strong holding in 9s.
