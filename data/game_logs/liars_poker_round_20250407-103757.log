Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 3s, two 9s, one 6, one 7, and one 8. The safest opening bid is usually two of a digit I have at least two of. I'll start conservatively with 2 0s, reflecting my hand and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 0, 6, 8, 9, 7, 1, 0, 3. I see two 0s and one 1. The current bid is 2 1s, and since I have only one 1, the likelihood that there are two or more 1s in total is plausible but not certain. Since I have two 0s, I know there are at least two 0s, but that bid has already been made. To increase the bid, I can bid 2 2s, but I have no 2s, making that risky. Alternatively, I can raise the quantity to 3 of a digit I have multiples of. I have two 0s, so bidding 3 0s is reasonable, expecting the opponent might have at least one 0. Therefore, the safest strategic move is to bid 3 0s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 1s in my hand, so all three 1s would have to be in Player 1's hand, which is unlikely but possible. Since I do have two 0s, I can confidently raise the bid to 3 2s, which is a strictly higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and more plausible given unknowns in Player 1's hand.
