Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. I have two 1s, one 2, one 5, one 6, one 9, and one 0. A conservative bid would be 1 0s, but I want to establish a reasonable starting point. Bidding 1 9s is a good option since I have one 9. It's not overly aggressive and provides a base for future bids.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (26719705), so I know there's at least one 9. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have a 7, which is higher than 9, and I see two 7s in my hand, I can bid on 7s. However, I should first check if bidding on 9s with a higher quantity is reasonable. Bidding 2 9s is a straightforward higher bid. I have one 9, and there are two other players, so it's plausible they have a 9 as well. Thus, bidding 2 9s seems like a reasonable and safe increase.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s, which matches my count. Since I need to make a strictly higher bid, I can either increase the quantity to 3 9s or keep the quantity at 2 and increase the digit to a higher number. Given that I have two 9s, it's reasonable to assume there might be at least one more 9 in the other players' hands, so increasing the quantity to 3 9s is a plausible move.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 4 9s is a reasonable increase, and I have a chance of it being true. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have two 1s, one 2, one 5, and one 6. Bidding 2 6s would be a lower bid and therefore not valid. Bidding 2 5s is also not valid. Bidding 4 0s is also valid, but since I have a 9, increasing the 9s seems more strategic. Bidding 4 9s is the most logical next step.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. My hand is 26719705, which contains two 9s. Given that there are 3 players and each has 8 digits, the total count of 9s could be reasonably higher than 4, considering the previous bids were all on 9s. However, bidding significantly higher might be risky. I can bid 5 9s, increasing the quantity, which seems like a reasonable next step given the history of bids on 9s.

Requesting action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. The current bid is 5 9s. Given that there are 24 digits in total, it's possible that there are at least two more 9s among the other players' hands. However, bidding higher would require me to go to 6 9s, which seems risky. Alternatively, I could bid the same quantity with a higher digit, but since 9 is the highest digit, this isn't possible. Challenging seems too risky given my own holdings, so the best move is to bid 6 9s.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Given the history, players are clearly holding 9s. Increasing the quantity seems like the most logical move. Bidding 7 9s is a reasonable step up, and I believe it's plausible given the previous bids. I am not confident enough to challenge.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since my hand is 26719705, I have one 9. The total count of 9s across all hands is being bid on as 7. Given the repeated bidding on 9s by all players and my own hand having one 9, it's plausible that there are at least 7 nines. However, increasing the quantity to 8 9s seems like a reasonable next step. Alternatively, bidding the same quantity on a higher digit is not possible since 9 is the highest digit. Thus, I will increase the quantity to make a higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 9s. I have two 9s in my hand (from 95973436). With three players each having 8 digits, the maximum possible 9s is 24, but the bid is already at 8, which is quite high. Given that the bid history shows a steady increase in the number of 9s, it's possible other players also have multiple 9s. However, bidding higher would require going to 9 9s or switching to a higher digit with at least 8. Since 9 is the highest digit, the only option is to bid 9 9s, which is risky. Alternatively, I can challenge, as 8 9s seems unlikely unless the other players collectively have 6 9s, which is possible but not highly probable. Given the risk, I choose to challenge.
