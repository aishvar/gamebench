Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid, I should make a reasonable starting bid. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding '8' with a quantity of '2' seems like a safe and plausible opening bid, as it's unlikely the opponent has a very high number of 8s. It's also not excessively high, making a challenge less likely later.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have 78965133, which includes two 8s. Since the bid is exactly matching my count, it's risky to challenge. I'll make a higher bid by increasing the quantity to 3.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. My opponent bid up from my 2 8s to 3 8s, suggesting they likely have at least one 8 themselves. If they have one 8, the total number of 8s is at least 3. If they have two 8s, the total is at least 4. If they have three 8s, the total is at least 5. It's reasonable they have one or two. Bidding 4 8s feels risky, as it requires my opponent to have at least two 8s, and it's possible they only have one. However, bidding 3 9s is a valid and safer bid, as I have one 9 in my hand. It changes the digit being counted, which could throw my opponent off. Therefore, I will bid 3 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s, and I have one 9 in my hand. Considering the previous bids, Player 0 might be bluffing, as the total number of 9s could be less than 3. Challenging is a strategic move to test the validity of their bid.
