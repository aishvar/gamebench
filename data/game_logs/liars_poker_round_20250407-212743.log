Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 32981334. This is the first bid of the game. I have three '3's, which is my most frequent digit. With 16 total digits across two players, the expected number of any digit is 1.6 per player, or 3.2 total. Since I hold three '3's myself, bidding '3 3s' is statistically very likely to be true (it only requires the opponent to have zero '3's or more). This bid leverages the strength of my hand and sets a reasonably high starting point, putting pressure on the opponent immediately.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. Looking at my hand (47105019), I have zero 3s. Since I have none, the entire count of 3s depends on Player 0's hand. For the bid of 3 3s to be valid, Player 0 must have all three or more 3s, which is unlikely given a random distribution (expected about 1.6 of any digit per hand). The probability they have 3 or more 3s is low, making the current bid suspicious. Therefore, challenging is the best strategic move.
