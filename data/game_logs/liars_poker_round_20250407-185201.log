Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid, I should make a reasonable opening bid. I have two 1s, one 2, one 5, one 6, one 8, and one 9 in my hand. A safe opening bid would be to claim two 1s. It's unlikely the opponent has more than two 1s, but it's not so low that it immediately invites a challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. My hand contains zero 1s. It is highly unlikely that Player 0 has two 1s, and even if they do, it's unlikely the total count of 1s across both hands is 2. Therefore, challenging the bid is the optimal move. A bid of '3 1s' would be a lie, and challenging forces Player 0 to reveal their hand.
