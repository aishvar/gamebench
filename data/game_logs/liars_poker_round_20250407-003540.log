Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can start with any valid bid. I have two 5s and one 6 in my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 5.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s and one 3, 8, 0, 4, 1, and 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. Since I don't have any 5s, the total count of 5s across both hands is likely to be low. Bidding 4 7s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have no 7s in my hand, but I do have two 5s and two 6s. Bidding 5 6s is a reasonable move as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid. This bid seems plausible given the information available.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which means there are at least 2 + 1 (opponent's possible 6) = 3 6s in total. The current bid is 5 6s, which seems plausible but not guaranteed. To make a higher bid, I can increase the quantity to 6, as I have two 6s and the opponent might have at least one more. This is a reasonable move to keep the game going.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 6S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. It is unlikely that there are 6 6s in total. I should challenge the bid.
