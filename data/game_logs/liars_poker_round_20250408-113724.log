Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a reasonable bid based on the digits in my hand. I have two 8s, which is a good starting point. Bidding 2 8s is a safe and valid first move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. The quantity is low, and I don't have any higher digits than 8. I should bid a higher quantity of the same digit.

Player 1 bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which matches my count. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I cannot increase the quantity of 8s, I will bid 3 9s, which increases the digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I can see that I have a 9 in my hand, but not enough to make a higher bid. I can also see that the previous bid was 3 8s, so a higher bid with the same quantity is not possible. I should challenge the current bid.
