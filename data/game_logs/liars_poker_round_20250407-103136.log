Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open with a starting bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 4s, two 5s, one 2, and one 6. A safe opening bid would be 2 of one of my more frequent digits. I'll choose 2 4s as my opening bid since I hold two 4s myself, making it likely true and a solid base bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 5s (digits: 15214564). Since the current bid is 2 5s, and I hold two myself, it's quite likely there are additional 5s in the opponent's hand. Therefore, challenging now is risky. A safe strategy is to increase the bid slightly, perhaps to 2 6s, which is a minimal legal raise and supported by the single 6 in my hand. This keeps pressure on the opponent while not overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 15214564, I have no 7s, so the likelihood that there are at least two 7s across both hands is plausible but not guaranteed. However, since the bid is only 2 7s, it's risky to challenge now. To increase the pressure strategically, I can make the next minimal valid bid, which is 2 8s, raising the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This keeps the game progressing without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 15214564, which contains no 9s at all. The current bid is 2 9s. Since there are 16 digits total and I have zero 9s, the opponent must have both 9s for the bid to be valid. Given the low probability of one player holding two 9s, it is unlikely this bid is true. Therefore, I should challenge.
