Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 0s, and one each of 9, 2, 5, and 7. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I will start with '2 3s' since I have two 3s myself, making it likely there are more in total.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 83614476, I have a total of 3 sixes, 2 fours, 2 eights, 1 seven, 1 three, 1 one, and 1 zero, and 1 nine. I can see that bidding 3 3s or higher would be reasonable if I think the total count of 3s is low, but I should also consider if there's a possibility that Player 0 has a high count of 3s. However, given that I have no 3s in my hand, I will bid on a digit that I have a higher count of. The highest digit I have is 6, and I have three of them. A reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity or the digit. I will bid 3 4s as I have two 4s and it seems like a reasonable and safe bet given my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 9, 0, 3, 3, 2, 5, 7, 1, which contains zero 4s. The current bid is 3 4s, so for that to be true, the opponent must have at least 3 or 4 4s, which is unlikely given their 8 digits. Since I have none, the probability that there are at least 3 total 4s is low. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
