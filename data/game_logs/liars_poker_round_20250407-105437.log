Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a low bid based on a digit I have in my hand. I have one 7, so I will bid 1 7s.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 1 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (15234602). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have one 7, bidding 2 7s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. However, I should also consider the possibility that the other player might have more 7s. Bidding 1 8s is also an option as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit. Given that I have no information about the other player's hand, I'll play it safe and bid 2 7s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 3 7s is a safe increment, as it's plausible given the total number of digits.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (from 15234602), so it's possible there are three 7s in total. However, I also have other digits that could be used to make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity and bid a higher digit. Since I don't have information about the other player's hand, I'll play cautiously. I can bid 3 8s, which is a higher digit than 7, or increase the quantity to 4 7s. Given that I have one 7, bidding 4 7s seems plausible as it increases the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. It's possible there are at least four 7s in total, but it's also possible there aren't. I will increase the bid to 5 7s. This is a small increase, and I'm not risking too much.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have seen the bids escalate on 7s, and I have two 7s and two other digits that could potentially be 7s across both players' hands, but I don't have any 7s other than the two. The quantity is already at 5, and the total count of 7s can't exceed 16. I can either bid higher in quantity or keep the same quantity with a higher digit. Bidding 5 8s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and doesn't excessively increase the quantity, making it a relatively safe bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 6 8s is a safe increase. Alternatively, I could bid 5 9s, but I have no 9s. I will stick with increasing the quantity of 8s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 8S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (from 15234602). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Increasing the quantity to 7 8s seems reasonable if I believe there's at least one more 8. However, given that I have one 8 and there are 8 digits per player, it's possible the other player also has an 8, making 7 8s plausible. Bidding 6 9s is also an option as it increases the digit. I'll choose to bid 7 8s as it directly increases the quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 7 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. It's plausible that there are at least 7 eights in total, but it's also possible that Player 1 is bluffing. I could bid 8 8s, but that would be risky. Given the bid history and the fact that I only have one 8, I'll challenge.
