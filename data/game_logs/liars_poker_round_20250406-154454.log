--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 6s, one 7, one 0, one 2, and one 1. A safe opening bid is usually 2 of a digit I have multiple of. I will start with 2 8s, as I hold two 8s myself, making this a solid and credible opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider my hand and the current bid. My hand contains the digits: 1, 9, 0, 9, 2, 3, 9, 8, 8. I see I have three 9s and two 8s and two other 8s are already bid. I should bid higher than 2 8s, considering the quantity and digit. A reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 8s and the bid is for 2 8s, so I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit seems reasonable since I have higher digits available and my hand does not strongly support a much higher quantity of 8s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 87062861, I have no 9s, so the current bid of 3 9s relies entirely on the opponent's hand, which seems unlikely since they would need all 3 or more 9s. However, I do have two 8s, making a bid of 3 8s plausible, but since 3 8s is lower than 3 9s, it's invalid. To outbid, I can bid 4 of any digit. I have two 8s, so a total of 4 8s across both hands is plausible. Given the distribution, 4 8s is a reasonable and safe incremental bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 4 8s in total. Given that I have no 8s in my hand (19092398), and assuming Player 0 has a reasonable distribution, it's unlikely they have more than 2 8s. With 16 digits in play (8 from each player), and my hand not contributing any 8s, I find it improbable that there are 4 or more 8s. Therefore, I should challenge this bid.
