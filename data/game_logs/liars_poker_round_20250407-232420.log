Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. As the first bidder, starting with a high digit like 9 forces the opponent to bid a higher quantity or challenge. Since my hand already guarantees at least two 9s, this bid is safe and strategic.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 34647538. This means I have two 3s, two 4s, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 8. I have zero 9s. The current bid is '2 9s' made by Player 0. Since I have no 9s, Player 0 must have at least two 9s in their 8-digit hand for the bid to be true. While not guaranteed, a count of 2 for a digit across 16 total digits is very low and quite plausible. Challenging this low bid seems risky. I should make a higher bid. My bid must be higher than '2 9s', meaning either quantity 3+ or quantity 2 with a digit higher than 9 (which is impossible). Therefore, I must bid at least quantity 3. I have two 3s and two 4s in my hand. Bidding '3 3s' or '3 4s' is well-supported by my hand, requiring only one matching digit from Player 0's hand of 8 digits, which is statistically likely. I will choose the lower of these options, '3 3s', as it is a safe increase from the current bid and leaves more bidding room.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 3/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s, meaning the opponent must have at least two 3s for the bid to be valid. Statistically, the probability of the opponent having two or more 3s in their 8-digit hand is relatively low (~18.75%), while the chance of them having fewer (making the bid invalid) is high (~81.25%). Challenging now offers a favorable probability of success compared to escalating the bid with uncertain outcomes like 3 5s or 3 9s.
