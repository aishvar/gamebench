Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7, two 6s, one 8, one 3, one 0, one 5, and one 9 in my hand. Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 2 6s is a safe starting point as I already have two 6s in my hand.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand and no 6s. The current bid is 2 6s. By bidding 2 8s, I maintain the quantity but increase the digit, which is a valid higher bid. Since I already hold two 8s, the total count of 8s across all players must be at least 2, making this a safe bid that forces the opponent to respond.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s. Since I only have one, it's possible the other player has one as well, making the bid valid. However, the probability is not high, so challenging seems reasonable. Alternatively, I could bid higher, but with only one 8 in my hand, it's risky to increase the bid on 8s. I could switch to a higher digit like 9, but I don't have any 9s in my hand. Challenging seems like the safer option.
