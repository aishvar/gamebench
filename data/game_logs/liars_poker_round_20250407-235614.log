Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand has two 4s. Since the current bid is None, starting with a truthful bid of 2 4s is safe. This forces the opponent to bid higher, either in quantity or digit, while minimizing risk of an immediate challenge loss.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I can bid a higher digit with the same quantity. I have a 5 in my hand, so bidding 2 5s is valid and increases the digit from 4 to 5, making it a higher bid.
