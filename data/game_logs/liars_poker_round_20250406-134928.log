Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I have to make the opening bid. Looking at my hand 60570226, I have two 0s, two 2s, two 6s, one 5, and one 7. The most common digits are 0, 2, and 6, each appearing twice. Statistically, there should be about 1-2 of each digit in the opponent's hand as well. Starting conservatively, bidding 3 of one of my strong digits is reasonable. I'll choose 3 2s to open.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 89170367, I have a total of 2 twos, which could potentially make the bid 5 2s if I include the possibility of Player 0 having more twos. However, I don't want to overestimate. I see that I have one 3 and several higher digits. A reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity or the digit. Given that I have one 3 and several higher digits, I can try to bid higher with a digit I have. I have one 2, so I can safely assume there are at least 3 2s if Player 0 only has 2 twos. However, I will increase the digit and keep the quantity the same or increase it slightly. I have two 6s and two 7s and one 8 and one 9, but no more 2s or 3s or 4s or 5s. My best bet seems to increase the digit. I have 2 sixes, 1 seven, 1 eight, 1 nine, and 1 six and 1 seven and 1 nine and 1 eight and 1 six. I should try to make a higher bid with a digit I have. I will bid 4 3s because I do not have 3s but I do have higher digits.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (60570226), I have no 3s, so the opponent's bid of 4 3s relies entirely on their own hand. Since each player has 8 digits, for the bid to be valid, there must be at least 4 total 3s, meaning the opponent would need to hold all 4 or more. This is statistically unlikely, as having half of one's digits being 3s is rare. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move.
