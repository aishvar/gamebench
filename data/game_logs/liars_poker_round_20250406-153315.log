Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game, and I have two 7s, two 0s, two 8s, one 2, and one 4 in my hand. A conservative yet reasonable opening bid would be 3 of a digit I have multiple of, such as 3 7s, since I hold two myself and it's likely there is at least one more in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 and no 9s in my hand (05516993). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I don't have information about the exact count of 7s or higher digits in the opponent's hand, I'll analyze my hand. I have one 9, which is the highest digit. I can bid 3 9s, matching the quantity but increasing the digit, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 7s, one 9, two 0s, two 8s, and one 4. The current bid is 3 9s. Since I only have one 9, for the bid to be valid, my opponent would need to have at least two 9s. While not impossible, it is somewhat unlikely given that three out of sixteen digits would all be 9s. Additionally, I have strong holdings in 7s (two) and 0s (two), making it safer to increase the bid in those digits. Therefore, a reasonable next bid is 4 7s, increasing the quantity and focusing on a digit I hold two of.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (05516993), so the total count of 7s must be at least 1 (mine) plus the count in Player 0's hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't know Player 0's hand, I'll analyze the likelihood based on my hand. I have one 7, and there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in Player 0's hand. The probability of having more than four 7s is low if we assume a uniform distribution, but Player 0 might have a reason to bid 4 7s. I will bid 4 8s, increasing the digit as my next move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. The current bid is 4 8s, which requires there to be at least three 8s in my opponent's hand. Given that each player has only 8 digits, it's unlikely that my opponent holds three or more 8s. The probability of four or more 8s in total is quite low with me holding only one. Therefore, challenging is a strong move here.
