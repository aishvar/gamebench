Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 5.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (41968253), I have one 5. The current bid is 3 5s, meaning there must be at least 3 fives across both hands. Since I only have one, that would require my opponent to have at least two 5s. This is plausible but not guaranteed. Instead of challenging now, a safer move is to increase the bid modestly. I notice I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s (same quantity, higher digit) is a valid next bid, leveraging my hand strength.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s. Since I have one 8, it is possible that the other player has two 8s, making the bid valid. However, bidding higher on 8s is risky because the other player might challenge. Instead, I should bid on a digit I know I have more of. I have two 5s, so bidding 4 5s is a reasonable move, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 41968253, I have no 5s at all, which casts doubt on the current bid of 4 5s. Since there are 16 digits total and I hold 8, the opponent would need to have at least 4 or more 5s alone, which is unlikely. Given this, the bid of 4 5s is probably an overstatement, so challenging is the best move.
