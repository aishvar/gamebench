Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 25701795. I count 2 fives, 2 sevens, and other digits appearing once or not at all. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and a common digit. I have two 7s and two 5s. Bidding on 7s or 5s seems reasonable. I'll start with bidding on a digit that is relatively high and has a decent count in my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a conservative start, considering the total count across all players.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 3 fives in total and consider my own hand. I have one 5 in my hand. Given that there are 32 digits in total and only one player has made a bid so far, I can make an educated guess. Since I only have one 5, I will increase the quantity slightly and choose a higher digit to make the bid more believable. I will bid 4 6s because I have two 6s in my hand, and it seems reasonable that other players might have some 6s as well.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s, which is already accounting for at least four 6s across all players. Since I have three, it's possible that other players have one more 6 to meet the bid. However, bidding higher would require either increasing the quantity to 5 or keeping the quantity at 4 and increasing the digit to 7 or higher. Given that I don't have any 7s in my hand, increasing the digit seems risky. Challenging might be premature since the bid is plausible. A safer move is to increase the quantity to 5 6s, as it's still within reasonable limits given my hand.

Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand (22419387), I have zero 6s. The current bid is 5 6s, which requires at least five 6s among all 32 digits. Since I hold none, the remaining 24 digits must contain all five or more 6s, which is statistically unlikely (average per digit is about 3.2). Given this, I believe the current bid is an overestimate and challenging is the optimal move.
