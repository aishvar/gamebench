Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits 0, 6, 7, 4, 2, 1, 9, and 8, all unique with no duplicates. The safest opening bid is typically 2 of a common digit, but since I have one of almost every digit, I can reasonably open with '2 0s', as zeros tend to be common and I have one zero myself.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. I can safely increase the bid. I have two 5s, so bidding 3 5s is a reasonable option. Alternatively, I could bid 3 1s, 3 2s, 3 3s, 3 7s, 3 8s, or 3 9s, but 3 5s seems like a good balance of increasing the quantity and the digit, considering my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 0, 6, 7, 4, 2, 1, 9, and 8, so I have zero 5s. The opponent has bid 3 5s, which suggests they may hold multiple 5s, but since I have none, it's unlikely they have all 3 or more. Given the total digits are 16, and I have none, the chance there are at least 3 is plausible but not certain. However, making a higher bid without any 5s in my hand is risky. It's better to challenge now, as the current bid may be an overstatement.
