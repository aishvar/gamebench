Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0, which already satisfies the current bid of 1 0s. Since the minimum raise must be either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit, and I have multiple 2s and 6s (two 2s and two 6s), a safe and strategic next bid would be 2 2s, as I already hold two of them. This increases the quantity and is a valid, safe increment.
