Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid and the current bid is 'None', I should start with a bid on a digit that is likely to be common in both players' hands. Given the current state of the game, I'll take a conservative approach and bid on a digit that is likely to be high in quantity. After analyzing the possible digits, I'll choose to bid on the digit '0' which is a common digit in many numbers.
