Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start safely by bidding 2 6s. This bid is guaranteed to be valid because even if the opponent has zero 6s, my own two 6s meet the bid quantity. Starting with this establishes a base while maintaining flexibility for future bids.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (67820880). The current bid is 2 6s, which means the opponent is claiming there are at least 2 sixes total between our hands. Since I have 1 six, this means they're claiming they have at least 1 six as well. This is entirely possible and even likely. I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s and one 7, one 6, one 2, and one 0. I could bid 3 6s, but that would be risky since I only have one 6. Instead, I'll bid 2 7s, which keeps the same quantity but increases the digit. This is safer because I already have one 7 in my hand, so I only need the opponent to have one 7 for this to be true.

Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 7s in my hand. The opponent's bid of 2 7s requires at least two 7s across both hands. Given the probabilities, there's approximately an 84% chance the opponent has fewer than two 7s (calculated via binomial distribution). Challenging now offers better odds than making a risky bid with similar uncertainty.
