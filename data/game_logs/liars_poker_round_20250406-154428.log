Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s and two 8s. A bid of '2 8s' seems reasonable as it is based on my own digits and does not overestimate the total count.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. The current bid is 2 8s, which is plausible because I have one and the opponent likely has at least one more. Moving forward, a minimal safe raise is to 2 9s, but since I have no 9s, that's riskier. I do have two 3s and two 7s, so a better strategy is to switch digits and increase quantity, bidding 3 3s, which is a valid higher bid and supported by my hand.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 8, 0, 9, 4, 6, 5, 6, and 1. I have two 6s and two 8s are not present but I do have an 8 and other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. Since I have two 6s and the current bid is 3 3s, I can increase the quantity or the digit. A reasonable bid would be to increase the digit and use my available numbers. I will bid 4 6s as it's a higher quantity and I have two 6s in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 73935780, I see zero 6s. Since the current bid is 4 6s, for it to be valid, the opponent would need to have all 4 or more 6s in their hand, which is quite unlikely given the distribution of digits. The probability of 4 or more 6s in one hand is low, and since I have none, challenging is the best move.
