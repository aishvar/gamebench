Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Since I'm the first to bid, I can choose any quantity and digit. Bidding 3 8s is a strategic choice to set a higher bar, assuming the opponent might have at least one 8. This bid increases the quantity from my hand and uses a high digit, making it a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I don't have any 8s in my hand. To make a valid bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. I could bid 3 9s or 4 of any digit. Bidding 4 0s seems like a safe, slightly higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. With only one 0 in my hand, it's unlikely Player 1 has three 0s. Challenging this bid could be advantageous.
