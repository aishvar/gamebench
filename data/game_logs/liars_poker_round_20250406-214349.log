Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 1 0s and looking at my hand (63876502), I notice I have one 0. Since the bid is very low and my hand contains one of the digits bid, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. However, given that I only have one 0 and do not have enough information about the other player's hand, bidding higher on 0s might not be the best strategy. Instead, I can look for a digit in my hand that appears more frequently or is higher than 0, to make a reasonable bid. I have two 6s, which could be a good starting point for a bid, considering it's higher than 0 and I have a decent quantity of it.
