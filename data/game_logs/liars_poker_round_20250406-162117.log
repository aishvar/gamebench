Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s and two 0s, which are the most frequent digits. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I'll start with 2 8s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, which means there needs to be at least one more 8 in the opponent's hand. Since 8s are relatively rare and the bid is low, it's plausible. However, I can make a safe higher bid by increasing the digit. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 2 9s is a reasonable move.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 2 9s, which means the opponent is claiming there are at least two 9s in total. Since I only have one, the opponent likely has at least one 9, making the current bid plausible. To increase the bid, the minimal valid higher bid would be 3 0s or 3 9s. I have one 0, so bidding 3 9s or 3 0s is somewhat risky but reasonable, as it's plausible there are three total 9s or 0s across both hands. Given that I have one 9 and one 0, and since the opponent might hold additional 9s or 0s, I will increase the quantity and choose 3 9s to maintain pressure.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s. Since there are only 16 digits in total, it's possible the opponent has two 9s, making the total three 9s. However, bidding higher is safer than challenging. I can bid 4 0s, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit low.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (90381845), I have one 0. The current bid is 4 0s, implying there are at least 4 zeros among 16 digits. Since I only hold one zero, the opponent would need to have at least three zeros, which is unlikely given the distribution. Typically, the expected count per digit is around 1.6 (16/10), so four zeros is on the high side. Given the improbability and my low count of zeros, challenging is the best move.
