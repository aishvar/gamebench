Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s. The current bid is only 1 0s, so I know for certain there are at least two 0s in total. Therefore, a safe and strictly higher bid is 2 0s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s and one 1. The current bid is 2 1s. Since I only have one 1, for the bid to be valid, Player 0 would need to have at least one or more 1s. Given the naive nature of Player 0, it's plausible but not certain. However, since the total number of 1s needed is only 2, and I have 1 myself, it's quite reasonable that there could be another 1 in Player 0's hand. Therefore, challenging now is risky. Instead, I will raise the bid slightly by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving from 2 1s to 2 2s, which is a minimal but valid increase.
