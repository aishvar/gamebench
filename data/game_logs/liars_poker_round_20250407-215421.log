Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I have the opportunity to make the first bid. I will choose a digit that I have in my hand and start with a reasonable quantity. I have the digits 3, 5, 7, 0, 9, and 1 in my hand. I will bid on the digit '3' with a quantity of 2, which is a solid opening bid without being overly aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. Looking at my hand (62594459), I have zero 3s. Since I have no 3s, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least 2 of them. The probability of the opponent holding 2 or more 3s out of 8 digits is relatively low (roughly 15-20%). Given this low likelihood, it's strategically sound to challenge, as the bid is probably an overstatement.
