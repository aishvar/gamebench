Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 8, and two 9s. The most frequent digit in my hand is 9, appearing twice. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand would be 2 9s, reflecting the two 9s I hold. This is a safe starting bid that leverages my known digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have two 8s in my hand. I could bid higher on 9s, but I don't have any. Since I have two 8s, bidding 3 8s seems like a reasonable and safe move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8 and two 9s. The current bid is 3 8s. Since I hold only one 8, for their bid to be valid, my opponent would need at least two 8s. Statistically, that's plausible, but not guaranteed. Rather than challenge now, I can increase the bid conservatively. I hold two 9s, so a safe next bid is 3 9s, which matches the quantity but raises the digit, making it a valid higher bid while relying on my strong count of 9s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 8 in my hand. I can bid 4 0s which is a valid bid, increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 4 1s, 4 3s, 4 4s, 4 6s, 4 7s or 4 8s. I could also bid 3 of any digit higher than 9, but since the digits are 0-9, this is not possible. I will bid 4 0s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have only one 0 in my hand, so for the current bid of 4 0s to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least 3 zeros, which is somewhat unlikely given the distribution of digits. Since zeros are generally less common and I only hold one, I suspect the opponent is bluffing or overestimating. Therefore, challenging is the best strategic move here.
