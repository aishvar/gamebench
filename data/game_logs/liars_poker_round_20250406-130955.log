Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning this is the first bid. I have two 7s, one 4, one 6, one 2, and one 0 in my hand. Bidding 1 7s is a safe and reasonable opening bid, as I know there are at least one or two 7s in play. It's a low risk way to start.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 7s. I should consider my hand and the possibility of higher bids. My hand contains 3 sevens, which immediately makes the bid of 1 7s likely to be false. However, my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge. Since I have multiple 7s, bidding higher on 7s or another digit seems reasonable. I have 3 sevens, so bidding 4 7s seems very likely to be higher, given that Player 0 only bid 1 7s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have three 7s in my hand. Bidding 5 7s is a reasonable increase, as it's a higher quantity and I have enough 7s to support the possibility. Alternatively, I could bid on another digit, but 7s seems like the most promising option given my hand and the existing bid history.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains 2 sevens. Given that the current bid is 5 7s, I should consider if I can make a reasonable bid that is higher. A bid of 6 7s or higher quantity with a higher digit could be valid. However, I should also consider the possibility of challenging if the bid seems unlikely. Since my hand has two 7s, and assuming Player 0 has at least 3 sevens to make the bid of 5 7s, bidding 6 7s seems reasonable but risky. I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I have no 8s or 9s, so bidding a higher digit isn't an option with certainty. I will increase the quantity slightly considering my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free) bids: 6 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have three 7s in my hand. I can safely bid higher by increasing the quantity. Bidding 7 7s is a logical next step, as it's a valid bid and leverages my hand. I don't want to challenge yet, as 6 7s is plausible, and I have enough 7s to support a higher bid.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) bids: 7 7s

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than this. I have a few 7s in my hand, which makes me think there could be a good number of 7s in total. However, bidding higher than 7 7s requires careful consideration of my hand and the possibility of Player 0 having a high number of 7s. Since my hand contains two 7s and I aim to increase the quantity, I can bid 8 7s or higher. But considering the risk and potential for Player 0 to have a significant number of 7s, I should think about bidding on a different digit or challenging. My hand has two 7s, and I also have other digits that could potentially be bid on. Given that I have one 8 in my hand and the total count of 8s could potentially be lower than 7s, I could consider bidding on 8s. However, I only have one 8, so bidding more than 1 8 seems risky without more information.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 7s. I have three 7s in my hand (72647407). This means there are at least three 7s in my hand, and potentially more in my opponent's. Bidding 9 7s is a plausible next step, as it's a small increment and still within the realm of possibility. Bidding a different digit would be risky as 7s have already been established as present. I could challenge, but given my hand, 9 7s feels like a reasonable bid, and challenging feels premature.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) bids: 9 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 7s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. I have a total of 8 digits in my hand: 99113660. I can see there are two 7s in my hand. Given that the current bid is 9 7s, I should consider if I can make a reasonable bid that is higher. Since my hand contains two 7s, I know there are at least 2 sevens in total (including Player 0's hand). The bid needs to be higher in quantity or digit. I can bid higher on the 7s or switch to a higher digit. Bidding 10 7s seems unlikely since I only have 2 sevens in my hand and Player 0 could have at most 8 (assuming they have no other 7s besides what's necessary to make 9 7s). However, I can try to bid on a higher digit or increase the quantity slightly if I think it's feasible.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free) bids: 10 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. The previous bids were all about 7s, and then Player 1 switched to 8s. A bid of 10 8s is quite high, given that there are only 16 total digits. It's very likely an overestimation. I will challenge the bid.
