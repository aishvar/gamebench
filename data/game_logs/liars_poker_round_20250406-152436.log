Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 4s, two 3s, one 2, one 7, one 9, and one 6. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, reflecting the two 5s in my hand and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have the hand 81290811, which contains one 8, two 1s, one 0, and the rest are other digits. There's no 5 in my hand. The bid of 2 5s implies there are at least two 5s in total. Since I don't have any 5s, it means the other player must have at least two 5s. I'm not confident to challenge this bid as it's possible the other player has the 5s. I need to make a higher bid. The next possible bid can be either increasing the quantity or keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit. I can bid 2 6s as my hand doesn't have a 5 but has other digits, and it doesn't seem too aggressive to start with a same quantity but higher digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6. Since the bid is 2 6s, it's plausible my opponent has at least one 6 as well, making the current bid reasonable. To raise, I can either increase the count or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. I don't have many high digits clustered, but I do have two 5s, which suggests a safe incremental bid is 2 7s, raising the digit while keeping the quantity unchanged and maintaining a conservative approach.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have the hand 81290811, which contains two 1s and one 8. I don't have any 7s. The bid of 2 7s is already quite high given that it's likely the other player also doesn't have many 7s. However, I can bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 3 7s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity, making it a valid higher bid. I should bid 3 7s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 47259536, I have the digits: 4, 7, 2, 5, 9, 5, 3, 6. Counting 7s, I have only one. The current bid is 3 7s, meaning there must be at least three 7s across all 16 digits. Since I hold only one 7, the opponent would need at least two 7s, which is plausible but not guaranteed. Bidding 3 8s is riskier due to the rarity of 8s, and 4 7s would require me to assume there are at least three 7s in their hand, which is unlikely. Given this, challenging the bid of 3 7s is the best move, as it's somewhat unlikely they have two 7s.
