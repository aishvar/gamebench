Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have a hand with digits 7, 0, 3, 1, 8, 5, 6, 2, I can start with a conservative bid based on the most frequent digit in my hand. The digit 1 appears once, so I'll bid 1 1s to start the game with a low-risk bid.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 1 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 1s in my hand, so the current bid of 1 1s is plausible but minimal. Since I don't want to challenge such a low bid with high likelihood of being true, the best move is to make a safe, strictly higher bid. I have two 7s, so I can confidently bid 2 7s, increasing the quantity and choosing a digit I hold multiples of.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 7S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s, which means there needs to be at least one more 7 in the opponent's hand. Given that the opponent bid 2 7s, they likely have at least one 7. However, increasing the bid to 3 7s might be risky since I don't know their hand. Instead, I can bid a higher digit that I have, such as 8, which is in my hand. Bidding 2 8s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, making it a valid higher bid.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 81943727, I have one 8 and two 7s. The current bid is 2 8s. Since I hold one 8, it's plausible my opponent has at least one, making the current bid reasonable. To raise, the next valid bids are 2 9s or 3 of any digit. I don't have any 9s, so bidding 2 9s is risky. However, I have two 7s, and since I already bid 2 7s earlier, I can now increase the quantity to 3 7s. Given I hold two 7s, it's likely there is at least one more 7 in the opponent's hand, making 3 7s a reasonable and safe raise.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which means Player 1 is implying there are at least two more 7s in their hand. Given that, it's plausible there are 3 or more 7s in total. However, I can make a safer bid by increasing the digit to 8, since I have an 8 in my hand and the current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 3 8s is a higher bid and is based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one 8 and two 7s. The current bid is 3 8s. Since I only have one 8, for Player 0's bid to be valid, they would need to have at least two 8s, which is somewhat unlikely but possible. However, since I have two 7s and the previous highest 7s bid was 3 7s, I can safely increase the quantity for 7s to 4, which is a natural and safer progression based on my hand strength.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total (8 per player), and the bid history shows a steady increase in the count of 7s, it's unlikely that there are 4 or more 7s across both hands. I should challenge this bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
