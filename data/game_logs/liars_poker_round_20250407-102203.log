Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, so the likelihood of at least one 0 among the combined 16 digits is still reasonable. Since the opening bid is very low, it is better to raise rather than challenge such a conservative bid. I notice I have two 4s in my hand, making a bid of 2 4s a safe and strictly higher bid (same quantity but higher digit).
