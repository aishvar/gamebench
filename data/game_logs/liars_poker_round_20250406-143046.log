--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there has been no bid yet, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, two 1s, one 2, one 7, one 9, one 5, and one 8. The most frequent digits in my hand are 4 and 1, each appearing twice. A conservative yet reasonable opening bid is 3 of either 4s or 1s, as there are likely to be at least one or two more of these digits among the other players' hands. I'll choose 4s for my initial bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand (from 54961688). The current bid is 3 4s, which is already close to my count. Since I don't have any higher digits in significant quantities, it's risky to bid higher on 4s or other digits. I should challenge the bid as it's unlikely that other players have enough 4s to make the total reach 3.
