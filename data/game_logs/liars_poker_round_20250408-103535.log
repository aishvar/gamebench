Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid, I need to make the first bid. My hand is 24257069. I count two 2s, one 5, and one 7, and one 9, and one 6, and one 0. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the most frequent digit in my hand. I have two 2s, so bidding on 2s seems like a good start. I'll bid 3 2s, assuming that the other player might also have at least one 2.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 2s but I do have three 1s (digits: 1, 9, 9, 1, 6, 6, 0, 0). Since the current bid is 3 2s, a minimal safe overbid would be 3 3s or 4 0s, but I have two 0s and three 1s. Bidding 3 1s is a lateral move with the same quantity but a lower digit, which is invalid. Therefore, the smallest valid bid is 3 3s or 4 0s. I have two 0s, and it's plausible the opponent has at least two more zeros or ones combined, but less likely for 2s given I have none. So, a safe incremental bid is 3 3s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity, and it doesn't overcommit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have the digits 24257069, which means I have 2, 4, 2, 5, 7, 0, 6, 9. There are no 3s in my hand. The total count of 3s across both hands must be at least the count in the other player's hand. Since I have no 3s, the bid of 3 3s implies the other player has at least three 3s. This seems plausible but I can bid higher. I can see that I have two 2s. Bidding 3 2s was my previous bid, so I need to go higher than 3 3s. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 4 2s is a valid move as it increases the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 2s (digits are 1, 9, 9, 1, 6, 6, 0, 0). The opponent's bid of 4 2s implies there are at least four 2s across both hands. Since I have zero, that would require the opponent to hold all four 2s, which is unlikely given only 8 digits per hand. The probability favors that there are fewer than four 2s in total, so challenging is the best move.
