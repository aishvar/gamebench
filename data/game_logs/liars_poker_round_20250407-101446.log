Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 5s, and two 7s. Starting with a conservative yet reasonable opening bid, I will select one of the digits with two occurrences in my hand. Bidding 2 5s is a safe opening bid that reflects my hand strength and leaves room for escalation.
