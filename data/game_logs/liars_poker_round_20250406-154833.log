Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I need to make the first bid. I have two 2s, one 3, one 4, two 6s, one 7. A conservative bid would be 1 0s, but I want to make a slightly more aggressive bid based on my hand. I'll bid 1 7s, as I have one 7 in my hand. This is a safe starting bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7, which already matches the current bid of 1 7s. Since there are 8 unknown digits in Player 0's hand, it is quite likely there could be more 7s. The minimum safe move is to increase the bid slightly. I don't see a reason to challenge such a low initial bid. I will raise to 1 8s, which is a higher digit at the same quantity, keeping the bid conservative.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 1 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. Bidding 2 8s would be risky as it's unlikely there's another 8 in my hand. I can bid 2 7s, since I have one 7 in my hand, or I can challenge the current bid of 1 8s. Given that I have no 8s, and the previous bid was 1 7s, it seems unlikely the opponent has an 8. Therefore, challenging seems like the best option.
