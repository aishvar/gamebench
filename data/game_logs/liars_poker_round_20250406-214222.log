Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '1 0s', I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have one '0' in my hand and considering the opponent could have at most one '0' for the bid to be plausible, bidding on a higher digit or increasing the quantity of '0s' could be risky without more information. However, noticing I have two '3's in my hand, I can make a bid that increases both the quantity and the digit, making '2 3s' a reasonable and higher bid compared to '1 0s'.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 2 4s and looking at my hand (34737609), I notice I have one 4. Since the goal is to make a strictly higher bid or challenge, and considering the distribution of digits, bidding a higher quantity of the same digit or the same quantity of a higher digit is necessary. Given that I only have one 4, increasing the quantity of 4s might not be the best strategy without more information. However, I can consider bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity, as this is a valid move. My hand contains a 7, which is higher than 4. Thus, bidding on 2 7s seems like a reasonable strategy, as it increases the digit value while keeping the quantity the same, making it a higher bid than 2 4s.
