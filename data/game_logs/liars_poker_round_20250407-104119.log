Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 7, 2, 8, 9, 8, 0, 8, 4. I see that I have one 0, which already meets the current bid of 1 0s without considering Player 0's hand. Since the minimum bid increase is either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit, I can safely increase the digit while keeping the quantity at 1. The lowest strictly higher bid would be 1 1s. This is a conservative yet valid move early in the game.
