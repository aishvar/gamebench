Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 9, 9, 5, 3, 1, 8, 1, 5. There are no 0s in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s depends entirely on Player 0's hand. Since there are 8 digits in Player 0's hand, it is quite plausible that there is at least one 0 overall, so challenging now would be premature. Instead, I will make a minimal legal raise by bidding 1 1s, since I have two 1s in my hand, making this a safe and natural incremental bid.
