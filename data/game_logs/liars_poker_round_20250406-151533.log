--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 8s, one 5, one 9, one 7, and one 1. The most frequent digits in my hand are 2s and 8s, each appearing twice. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I will start with 2 8s, as I have exactly two 8s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (since my hand is 30819945 and it contains one 8). This means there are at least two 8s in total. I can bid higher than 2 8s. The next higher bid can be either 3 8s or 2 9s. Since I have one 8, bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. I will bid 3 8s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. The current bid is 3 8s, which means there must be at least two 8s in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution of digits, it's unlikely the opponent has two or more 8s, as that would mean at least three total. Since I only have one, the probability of the opponent having two or more is low, so challenging is a strong move.
