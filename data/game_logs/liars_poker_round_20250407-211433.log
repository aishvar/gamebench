Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. The digit '0' appears once in my hand. Assuming the other player also has a similar distribution, bidding 'Q D' (quantity 10 of digit 0) is a reasonable starting point. This bid is likely to be challenged if the other player does not have a '0' in their hand, but it sets a baseline for further bidding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 3/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. The digit '0' appears once in my hand. Assuming the opponent has a similar distribution, a bid of 'Q D' (7 of the digit 0) is a reasonable starting point. This bid is high enough to put pressure on the opponent but not so high that it's easily challenged.
