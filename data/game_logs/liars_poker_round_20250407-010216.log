Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 7.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have my hand of 88619704 which contains zero 7s. The opponent bid '3 7s', claiming there are at least 3 sevens total. Since I have zero 7s in my hand, this means the opponent would need to have at least 3 sevens in their hand of 8 digits for their bid to be true. While possible, having 3 or more of the same digit in an 8-digit hand is somewhat unlikely. Given I have two 8s in my hand, I could bid '3 8s' which would be a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and one I know is true. This seems safer than challenging.

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 7s in my hand, which makes a bid of 4 7s a reasonable increase in quantity while maintaining a high digit. This bid is higher than the current bid because it has a higher quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I can see my entire hand of 88619704, which contains only one 7. For the opponent's bid of '4 7s' to be true, they would need to have at least three 7s in their hand since I only have one. While possible, this seems unlikely given they started with a bid of '3 7s' and raised it after I bid '3 8s'. They might be bluffing by raising to '4 7s'. Additionally, I have strong evidence of other digits in my hand (two 8s), which makes it less likely for multiple 7s to exist in their hand. The probability of them having exactly three 7s when I can see only one is relatively low.
