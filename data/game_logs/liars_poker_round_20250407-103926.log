Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, and the current bid is 1 0s. Since I know I have at least one 0, the bid is likely valid, so challenging is unwise. To continue the game, I can safely increase the bid by either raising the quantity or the digit. The minimal strictly higher bid is 1 1s, which is safe and conservative.
