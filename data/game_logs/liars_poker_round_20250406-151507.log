Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 06181603, which contains two 6s and one 0, one 1, one 8, and one 3. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. Since I have two 6s, bidding on 6s seems like a good start. I'll bid 2 6s as it's a conservative start and reflects some information from my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 74691543, I have zero 6s. The current bid is 2 6s, meaning the opponent claims there are at least two 6s in total. Since I have none, all two would have to be in their hand, which is possible but not very likely. However, since 2 is a relatively low quantity and it's early in the bidding, it's safer to raise the bid slightly rather than challenge immediately on a plausible bid. I will increase the digit at the same quantity to keep the bid conservative.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (from 06181603). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I see one 7, bidding 3 7s is plausible because it suggests there are at least two more 7s across both hands, which is possible. I will increase the quantity to make a higher bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one 7 (the first digit). The current bid is 3 7s, so for that to be valid, the opponent must have at least two 7s, which is plausible but not certain. Since I only have one 7, raising the bid on 7s is risky. Looking at other digits, I have two 4s and two 9s. A safe way to increase the bid is to use the same quantity (3) but a higher digit. Since 9 is higher than 7 and I hold two 9s, bidding 3 9s is a reasonable strategic move, as the chance of at least one 9 on opponent's side is decent, and it puts pressure back on them.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 6 and one 8, and no 9s in my hand. The bid of 3 9s implies there are at least three 9s across both hands. Given I have no 9s, the other player must have at least three 9s. This is possible but seems unlikely as it would mean the other player has a high concentration of 9s. However, bidding 4 0s increases the quantity and changes the digit to the lowest possible, making it a relatively safe bid. I will bid 4 0s, as it is a higher quantity than the current bid and seems plausible given the distribution could be spread across various digits.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 74691543, I have no 0s. Since there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in my opponent's, the total digits are 16. The current bid is 4 0s. Given I have zero 0s, my opponent would need to be holding all 4 or more 0s for the bid to be valid. This is quite unlikely statistically, as 4 zeros in a single hand is rare. Therefore, I believe the bid is an overstatement and the best move is to challenge.
