Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable bid. I have a '2' and a '7' in my hand. Bidding 3 2s is a safe starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one '2'.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand, which means there are at least 3 2s in total (my two plus the one in the opponent's hand). The current bid is 3 2s, so I can either bid higher or challenge. Since I know there are at least 3 2s, challenging would be risky. Instead, I can bid 4 0s, as I have two 0s in my hand, and this increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 0s

Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are 4 0s in total, so I should challenge this bid.
