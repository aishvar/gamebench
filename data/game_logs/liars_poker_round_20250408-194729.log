Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 6, making the bid valid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I examined my hand (28662302) and found I have three 2s, which is my strongest count. While the current bid of 3 6s is marginal—with me holding two 6s a challenge would win only if the opponent has no additional 6s (roughly a 43% chance)—I can leverage my strength in 2s. By raising the bid to 4 2s, I increase the quantity (which is allowed regardless of digit) and rely on my three 2s plus the chance (about 57%) that the opponent has at least one 2. This makes BID: 4 2s a more favorable move than challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have two 6s in my hand, which is a higher digit than 2. Bidding 5 6s is a reasonable move as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid, and it's plausible given my hand and the bid history.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I only have two 6s in my hand, which makes the current bid of 5 6s very unlikely since it requires at least three more 6s from the opponent’s 8 hidden digits. Statistically, the probability that the opponent has three or more 6s is extremely low, so challenging the bid is the most prudent move.
