Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 3 0s as the opening bid is strategic because it leverages my existing 0s while leaving room for the opponent to either raise the quantity or bid a higher digit. The bid is plausible given there are 16 total digits, and it sets a baseline challenge.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (41524329), I have zero 0s. Since I hold half the digits and have no 0s, the opponent must have at least 3 zeros for the bid to be true. That is unlikely given the typical distribution (each digit expected about 1.6 times per hand). Therefore, I suspect the bid is an overstatement and should challenge.
