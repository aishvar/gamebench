Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 06799318. I have two 9s, which is the digit I hold the most of. With 16 total digits in play (8 for me, 8 for the opponent), the expected total count for any digit is 1.6. Having two 9s myself makes it statistically plausible that there are at least three 9s in total across both hands (expecting the opponent to have at least one 9 on average). Bidding '3 9s' is a reasonable opening bid that leverages my hand's strength without being overly aggressive.
