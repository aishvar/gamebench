Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 2 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '4' in my hand. The current bid is 2 4s, which means there needs to be at least one more '4' in the opponent's hand. Since the bid is low and I have one '4', it's reasonable to assume the opponent might have at least one '4' as well. To stay safe, I'll increase the bid slightly by raising the digit to '5', which I also have one of in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 5S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 5s. Challenging is a good move because if Player 1 has fewer than 2 fives, I win. Given that I have none, it's possible they have only one or none, making the challenge worthwhile.
