Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so any valid bid is acceptable. I have two 1s, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 8, one 9, and two 0s in my hand. Starting with a low bid to gather information seems prudent. I will bid 2 0s, as I have two 0s in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s, which is a very low bid. I have two 8s in my hand, so I can safely bid a higher quantity or digit. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 4 8s would be a reasonable increase, but it's risky. I could also bid on a different digit. I have two 1s, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 9 and two 0s. Bidding 4 9s is a plausible option, as it increases both the quantity and digit. Bidding 4 0s is also an option, but the previous bid was 2 0s, so it's more likely the opponent has some 0s. Given I only have two 0s, 4 0s seems too aggressive. Therefore, I will bid 4 9s.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. With my hand having 2 9s, I should aim to increase both quantity and digit. However, since I only have 2 9s, I should keep the quantity the same but increase the digit. My hand has one 6, so I should bid 4 6s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have 2 9s in my hand. Bidding 5 9s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. While I could bid higher on 9s (e.g., 6 9s), it's risky given I only have one. A safer approach is to bid on a digit I have multiple of, or a digit where I suspect the opponent might have some. I have two 1s. Bidding 6 1s is a reasonable increase in quantity and avoids relying heavily on the opponent not having 9s. It's also plausible given the total number of cards.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 6 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have 2 ones in my hand, which is more than the current quantity. I should bid a higher quantity or digit to increase my chances.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 1S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 7 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. Given the history, the opponent seems willing to bid aggressively on digits they may or may not have. Bidding 8 1s is a reasonable increase, as it's a higher quantity. It's a risky bid, but the opponent has already bid high on 9s and 1s, suggesting they're comfortable bluffing. I want to test their resolve.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 1S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 8 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s. With two 1s in my hand, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity or digit. I see that Player 0 has made several bids with 1s, so I'll increase the digit to 2s. Bidding 9 2s seems reasonable.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 2S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 9 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. Given the history, the bids have been escalating. While challenging is tempting, it's possible the other player has a significant number of 2s. I have a 3, 4, 5 and 9 in my hand. Bidding 10 3s would be a reasonable increase in quantity. Since the maximum possible quantity is 16, this seems plausible. Alternatively, I could bid 9 3s which would increase the digit. I will choose to bid 10 3s.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 10 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 3s. I have a 3 in my hand. Bidding 10 3s is not possible since the bid must be strictly higher, so I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. I can increase the digit to 4 since it's higher than 3.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 4S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 10 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. It's unlikely there are 10 4s total. While I could bid higher, the risk of being caught in a bluff is high. Challenging seems like the best option, as the bid seems inflated given my hand and the limited number of cards.
