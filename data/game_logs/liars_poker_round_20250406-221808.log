Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 3 3s is reasonable since there's a chance the opponent has at least one 3. Choosing a higher digit (3 over 2) gives future bids more flexibility to increase the digit if they keep the same quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 6s and two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s. Bidding 4 5s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. To meet the bid, the opponent's 8 digits would need at least three 5s, which is statistically unlikely. Challenging this bid is advantageous given the low probability of the total exceeding three 5s.
