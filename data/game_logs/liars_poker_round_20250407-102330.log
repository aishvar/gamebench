Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have three 0s, two 2s, two 4s, and one 9. The most frequent digit in my hand is 0, with three occurrences. Opening with '3 0s' leverages my strong count of zeros and sets a solid but reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 0s (digits: 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 1, 2, 2). The current bid is 3 1s, and I only see one 1, making it less likely that there are three or more 1s total. Given my strong count of 0s, a safer and strategic move is to raise the bid to 4 0s, leveraging my known hand strength and increasing the bid.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 1 (Naive 50/50)
Player 1 (Naive) chose to BID: 4 1s
Player 1 (Naive 50/50) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 0s and zero 1s. The current bid is 4 1s. Since I have no 1s, for the bid to be true, the opponent must have at least 4 1s in their hand of 8 digits, which is unlikely given the distribution. The probability that the opponent has 4 or more 1s is low, so challenging here is strategically sound.
