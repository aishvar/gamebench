Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 3s, one 4, one 5, two 7s, and two 8s. Starting with a bid of 2 3s is reasonable as it's based on my actual hand and leaves room for the opponent to respond.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, which guarantees at least two 9s total. Bidding '2 9s' is a safe outbid over '2 3s'.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s, which is possible if the opponent has at least one 9. Since I have one 9, it's plausible that there are at least two 9s in total. To make a higher bid, I can increase the quantity to 3 9s, which is still within the possible range given the total digits in play.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, so 3 total 9s is quite plausible, making a challenge risky. I also have two 6s, so I'll raise the bid by switching to 4 6s, which is a valid outbid and could be believable.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (from 37381845). The current bid is 4 6s, which means Player 1 is implying there are at least 4 sixes in total. Since I only have one, it's unlikely Player 1 has three sixes to make the total four. Challenging seems like the best move.
