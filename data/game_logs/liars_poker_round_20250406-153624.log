Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 3s, and one each of 1, 2, 6, and 8. A conservative but reasonable opening bid would be 2 3s, as I hold two 3s myself, making it likely that the total count is at least two or more.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have one 7 in my hand and no 3s. The quantity is relatively low, so I can make a reasonable guess. I will bid 3 3s, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same. This is a conservative move, as I don't have information about the other player's hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 6, 3, 0, 3, 0, 8, 2, 1. I count two 3s. The current bid is 3 3s, so the opponent is claiming there are at least three 3s total. Since I have two myself, it's quite plausible the opponent has at least one 3, making the bid reasonable. Challenging now would be risky. To outbid, I can either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity on a higher digit. I have two 0s and one 6 and one 8. Bidding 3 6s or 3 8s would be risky as I only have one of those. However, I have two 0s, so bidding 3 0s is a safe minimal raise. Alternatively, I can raise the quantity to 4 for any digit. Since I have two 3s, bidding 4 3s is a reasonable next bid, assuming the opponent might have at least two 3s as well. This is a conservative but valid raise.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have a lot of high digits, I'll first check if increasing the digit is feasible. Bidding 4 4s is a possibility. However, I should also consider the likelihood of the bid being true. Given that I have one 3 and there are 8 digits in my hand, it's plausible that there are at least 4 3s in total. I'll take a cautious approach by bidding 4 4s, which is a higher bid than 4 3s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 63030821, I have the digits: 6, 3, 0, 3, 0, 8, 2, 1. Counting 4s, I see zero 4s in my hand. The opponent must have at least 4 4s to make their bid true, which is unlikely given I have none. The total number of digits is 16, so for there to be 4 or more 4s, all would need to be in their hand. Since the probability of having 4 or more 4s solely in their hand is low, challenging is the best move.
