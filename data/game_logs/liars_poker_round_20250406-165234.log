Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '87093283', I have zero 0s. Since the total number of digits is 16 and I have none, all 0s must be in Player 0's hand. The current bid is 2 0s, which implies Player 0 is claiming there are at least two 0s total. Given I have none, it's plausible they have two 0s themselves. This makes challenging risky. To avoid that, I will make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving to 2 1s, which is a standard safe incremental bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity to 3 and keeping the digit as 1. That is a safe increase.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 1S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 87093283, I have zero 1s. The current bid is 3 1s, which requires at least three 1s across both hands. Since I have none, all three would need to be in Player 0's hand, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. The probability of them having 3 or more 1s is quite low, so challenging is the best move.
