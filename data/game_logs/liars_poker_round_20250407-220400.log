--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. My hand contains two 3s, two 5s, two 1s, one 0, two 4s, and one 2. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I can safely start with '2 3s' or '2 5s'. Choosing '2 5s' as it's a common digit and I have two of them, making it a solid opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s. Bidding 2 6s is a valid higher bid as it has the same quantity but a higher digit. This is a safer move since I can confirm at least two 6s exist.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '30512534', I have no 6s. The current bid is 2 6s, which is plausible given 16 total digits, but since I have zero 6s, I rely entirely on the opponent having at least two 6s. This is possible but not certain. Rather than challenge a relatively low and plausible bid, it's safer to increase the bid with a digit I have more of. I have two 5s, so bidding 3 5s is reasonable and strictly higher than 2 6s.

Player 0 bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s, and I have no 5s in my hand. Since I don't have any, Player 0 must have all the 5s. Bidding higher would require assuming Player 0 has more 5s, which seems unlikely. Challenging is a calculated risk to test the validity of their bid.
