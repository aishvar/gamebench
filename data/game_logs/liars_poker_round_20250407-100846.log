Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with a safe bid that guarantees at least two 9s across all players (as I already hold two) ensures I won't lose if challenged. This also sets a high digit (9), forcing the opponent to increase quantity on any future bids.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (79851761). For the bid to be true, the opponent needs at least one 9 out of their 8 digits, which is quite likely. Challenging a low bid like 2 9s is risky. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 1s and two 7s. The lowest possible higher bid is 3 0s. Bidding based on my hand, 3 1s seems like a safe and plausible next bid, as it only requires the opponent to have one 1, and I already possess two. This is a minimal increase over the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 1s in my hand. The opponent bid 3 1s, meaning they must have all three. Given the low probability of holding three 1s in an 8-digit hand (â‰ˆ8% assuming uniform distribution), challenging is statistically favorable. Even if they have two 1s, the bid fails. This outweighs the risk of them having exactly three.
