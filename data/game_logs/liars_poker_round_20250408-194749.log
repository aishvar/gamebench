Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 3 digits in my hand that are greater than 5 (0, 6, 7). The current bid is None, so I can start with a low quantity and high digit. Bidding 1 6s seems reasonable, as it's a low-risk bid with a high digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 17280943, and I hold a 7. The current bid is 1 6s, and I need to bid something strictly higher. By bidding 1 7s, I use the fact that I have a 7, ensuring at least one exists. Since bidding 1 7s is a minimal and safe increment over 1 6s, and challenging 1 6s would be risky given the opponent may hold a 6, I'll raise the bid with confidence.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 7s, which is a low digit. I have two 6s in my hand, so I should make a bid that increases both quantity and digit. Bidding 2 8s or higher seems reasonable, but I'll start with a low-digit bid to see if I can get a cheap win.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, so bidding '2 9s' leverages my own card while only marginally increasing the current bid from '2 8s'. Since a bid with the same quantity but a higher digit is valid, and challenging now would risk losing if the opponent holds an 8, raising the bid to '2 9s' is a cautious yet strategic move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s, which is relatively low. I have a 9 in my hand, so I should bid a higher quantity or the same quantity but a higher digit to make my bid more believable. Considering my hand, I can bid 3 9s.

Player 0 bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I only have one 9 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 9s. This bid requires that the opponent hold at least two additional 9s in their 8 digitsâ€”a probability of roughly 18-19% under uniform randomness. Bidding further (which would require raising to 4 of some digit) would be even riskier given my hand. Therefore, challenging the bid seems the most prudent action.
