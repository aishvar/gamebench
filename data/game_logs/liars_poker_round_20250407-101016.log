Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 4, 1, 0, 6, 4, 7, 8, 3, which includes exactly one 0. Since the current bid is 1 0s, it is likely valid, but I cannot challenge it anyway. To make a strictly higher bid, I can either increase the quantity to 2 (for any digit), or keep the quantity at 1 and increase the digit. Given my hand has two 4s, a reasonable next bid is 2 4s, as my own hand already accounts for both. This is a safe incremental increase.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 4, 1, 0, 6, 4, 7, 8, 3. There are no 5s, so the current bid of 2 5s relies entirely on Player 0's hand. Since Player 0 made the bid, it's plausible they have both 5s, but unlikely they would risk bidding on just their own digits without some bluffing. Given no 5s on my side, the chance of at least 2 total 5s is moderate but not certain. Rather than risk raising on a digit I have none of, a better strategy is to bid on a digit I have multiple of. I have two 4s, and the current bid is 2 5s. I can outbid by bidding 3 4s, which is a higher quantity and on a digit I hold two of, making it a safer and stronger bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 41064783, I have one 5 and one 4. The current bid is 3 5s, which means there must be at least three 5s across both hands. Since I have only one 5, Player 0 would need to have at least two 5s for their bid to be valid. Given the naive opponent's previous incremental bids, it's plausible but not guaranteed. Bidding 3 6s is risky since I only have one 6, but increasing the quantity to 4 with a digit I have some of (like 4) is safer. I have one 4, so assuming Player 0 might have two or more 4s, bidding 4 4s is a reasonable, slightly aggressive but defensible move that raises the quantity.
