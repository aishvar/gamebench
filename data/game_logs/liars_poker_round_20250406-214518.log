Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 3, 8, 7, 1, 7, 0, 1, 7, which includes one 0. Since the current bid is 1 0s, and I have one myself, the bid is plausible. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Looking at my hand, I notice I have three 7s, which suggests a strong basis for a higher bid on 7s. Given that, a conservative but higher bid would be 1 7s (same quantity, higher digit), but to be strategic and aggressive, I will bid 3 7s, leveraging my strong count of 7s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 38717017, I have two 7s and one 8. The current bid is 3 8s. Since I only have one 8, for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least two 8s. Statistically, with 8 digits, it's unlikely the opponent has two or more 8s, especially since I already hold one. The probability of three or more 8s total is low, so challenging is the best move here.
