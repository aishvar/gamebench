Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 7s, two 0s (again), one 8, and one 1. The digit 0 appears three times, making it a strong candidate for the opening bid. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 0s, reflecting my own hand and keeping the bid conservative.
