Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 3, one 4, two 5s, two 7s, one 6, and one 9. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, as I already hold two 5s myself, making it highly probable that there are at least two 5s in total.
