Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start with an opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 3s, one 5, one 6, one 2, and one 0. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 8s, as I hold exactly two 8s myself, making it likely that the total count is at least two or possibly more. This is a safe and strategic opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s, so for the current bid of 2 9s to be valid, the opponent must have both 9s, which is unlikely but possible. Since there are 16 digits total, and low bids like 3 of common digits are quite reasonable, the safest strategic move is to raise conservatively. I have two 8s in my hand, and the previous bid was 2 8s, so bidding 3 8s is a safe incremental increase supported by my hand, increasing the quantity beyond the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 1 (Naive 50/50)
Player 1 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 9s
Player 1 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9 (none), so zero 9s. Since the total digits are 16, and I have zero 9s, for the opponent's bid of 3 9s to be true, the opponent must have all three or more 9s in their hand, which is unlikely given the distribution. The probability of the opponent having three or more 9s is low, so challenging here is a strong move.
