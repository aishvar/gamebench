Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. Since the current bid is 1 0s, I can confidently increase the bid to 2 0s, which is a strictly higher bid and well-supported by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one '0' and one '1'. The current bid is 2 1s, which is plausible since I personally have one '1', so the opponent only needs to have at least one '1' to satisfy the bid. Challenging now would be risky. The minimal safe raise is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity, so I will bid 2 2s, which is a strictly higher bid and strategically conservative.

Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 8, and one 9. The current bid is 2 3s, and I hold exactly one 3. Since the opponent likely has at most one 3 (expected distribution), the bid of 2 3s is plausible, but raising to 3 3s would be risky. However, I notice I have two 0s in my hand, making a bid of 3 0s a safer and higher bid, since I can reasonably expect at least one 0 in the opponent's hand. Therefore, I will increase the quantity and revert to a digit I have strong holdings in.
