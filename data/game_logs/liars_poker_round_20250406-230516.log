Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand. Since there are 16 total digits across both players, starting with a bid of three 3s is safe because even if the opponent has zero 3s, my own three ensure the total meets the bid. This establishes a foundation while minimizing early risk.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 6, 7, 6, 5, 6, 1, 9, 0. I have zero 3s, so to satisfy the current bid of 3 3s, the opponent must have at least 3 of them, which is plausible but somewhat unlikely. However, since this is the opening bid and relatively conservative, challenging now is risky. Instead, I notice I have three 6s, so a reasonable and safe way to overbid is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Therefore, I will bid 3 6s, which is strictly higher and supported by my hand.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 6s in my hand. For the current bid of 3 6s to be valid, Player 1 must have all three 6s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of having â‰¥3 of a specific digit in 8 random digits is very low (~4%). Given this unlikelihood and my lack of 6s, challenging is statistically favorable.
