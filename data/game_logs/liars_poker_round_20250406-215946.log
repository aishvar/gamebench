Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand, making it a strong foundation for a bid. Starting with 3 6s is a reasonable and safe opening bid, as it's likely to be valid given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (from my hand 33142712). The current bid is 3 6s, which means the opponent is claiming there are at least two more 6s in their hand. Since the total possible 6s in the game is 16, but given the randomness, it's plausible but not certain. I can either bid higher or challenge. Since I have a 7 and a 2, which are higher digits, I can make a bid of 3 7s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 7s. Player 1 would need at least two more 7s for the bid to be valid. Considering the uncertainty and the potential that Player 1 might be bluffing, challenging the bid seems like a reasonable move.
