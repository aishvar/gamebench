Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s and two 2s, which are the most frequent digits. A safe and strategic opening bid is 2 3s, reflecting my hand strength and leaving room to increase later.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 2, 6, 4, 3, 0, 3, 5, 2. I can see exactly one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 2 4s, so I expect my opponent to have at least one 4, which is plausible. To raise, I can either bid 2 5s (same quantity, higher digit) or increase the quantity. I have one 5, so bidding 2 5s is reasonable, as it requires only one more 5 across both hands, which is likely. Therefore, I will bid 2 5s to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same.
