Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 0s (digits: 1, 4, 0, 1, 7, 3, 0, 7). Since the current bid is only 1 0s, it is very safe to increase the bid. Given I already hold three 0s, bidding 3 0s is a conservative and strong move, as it's highly probable there are even more 0s in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '14017307', I have two 0s and two 1s. The current bid is 3 1s. Since I hold two 1s, the bid requires only one more 1 in Player 0's hand to be valid, which is quite plausible. Rather than challenging, it's safer to raise the bid. I will increase the digit from 1 to 2 while keeping the quantity at 3, which is a strictly higher bid and reasonable based on the likelihood of some 2s in both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '14017307', I have two 0s, two 1s, two 3s, one 4, and one 7. The current bid is 3 3s, and I already hold two 3s. It is quite plausible there is at least one more 3 in the opponent's hand, making the current bid reasonable or even conservative. Challenging now is risky. A safe and strategic move is to raise the bid slightly by increasing the digit to 3 4s, as I have one 4, and it's a minimal increment. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity on a digit I have multiples of. However, bidding 4 0s is more aggressive and justified since I hold two 0s, so it's likely there are at least two more across both hands. Therefore, I will bid 4 0s to increase the quantity confidently.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 14017307, which contains two 1s. The current bid is 4 1s. Since I have two, the opponent would need at least two 1s in their hand for the bid to be valid. The probability of the opponent having two or more 1s in their 8 digits is moderate but not high. Given the naive nature of Player 0 and the escalation of bids, it's plausible they are bluffing or overestimating. Challenging now is a good strategic move as the bid likely overstates the true count.
