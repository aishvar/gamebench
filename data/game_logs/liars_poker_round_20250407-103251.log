Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 3s, two 5s, one 1, and one 8. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be 2 of a digit I have multiple of, such as 2 3s or 2 5s. I'll choose 2 5s because 5 is a middle digit, making it a balanced opening bid.
