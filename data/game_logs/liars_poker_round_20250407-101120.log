Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open. My hand contains two 0s, one 1, one 5, one 7, and two 9s. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 9s, reflecting my own hand and leaving room to escalate later.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I see two 0s and two 9s. The current bid is 3 0s. Since I already hold two 0s myself, it's quite plausible there is at least one more zero in Player 1's hand, making the bid believable. Challenging now would be risky. To make a higher bid, I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, so bidding 3 9s is reasonable because I have two 9s, and it's likely Player 1 has at least one more 9. Alternatively, I could bid 4 0s, but that might be pushing the quantity too high given I only hold two 0s. Therefore, the safest strategic move is to bid 3 9s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Calculating action for Player 1 (Naive 50/50)
Player 1 (Naive) chose to BID: 4 0s
Player 1 (Naive 50/50) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s. The current bid is 4 0s, meaning there must be at least two more 0s in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. Given that having four or more 0s across both hands is somewhat unlikely, and Player 1 has already escalated the bid on 0s twice, it seems probable they are bluffing or overestimating. Therefore, I should challenge this bid.
