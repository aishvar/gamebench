Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, and the current bid is only 1 0s. Since there are two players, the total number of 0s could be at least 2 (if the other player also has one 0). Bidding 2 0s is a safe and logical next step, increasing the quantity based on the possibility of the other player having at least one 0.
