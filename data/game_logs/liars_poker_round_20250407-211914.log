Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, the counts of digits are: 0 appears twice, 1 appears twice, 3 appears once, 4 appears once, 7 appears once, and 8 appears once. The most frequent digits in my hand are 0 and 1, each appearing twice. Statistically, starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid is best. A bid of 3 for digit 1 is a common safe opener, since I hold two 1s and it's likely the opponent has at least one. However, bidding 3 for digit 0 is equally valid, but I'll select 3 for 1s as my opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s, meaning Player 0 claims there are at least three '1's across both players' hands. In my hand, I have only one '1'. To reach the total of three '1's, Player 0 would need to have at least two '1's in their hand. This is plausible, as it is not an overly high bid at this stage of the game. Challenging this bid would be risky because it is reasonable for Player 0 to have two or more '1's. Instead, I will raise the bid to 4 1s, as this is a natural progression and keeps the game moving while putting pressure on Player 0.

Player 1 bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 ones. In my hand, I have digits: 4,1,1,0,3,0,8,7. I see two 1s in my hand. For the total to be at least 4, the opponent would need to have at least two more 1s. Since each player has 8 digits, it's plausible but somewhat aggressive. However, it's still within reason and not highly unlikely. Instead of challenging now, a safer approach is to increase the bid to a higher digit count that's supported by my hand. I have two 0s, so bidding 4 zeros is an equal quantity bid but on a higher digit, which is valid and strategic. Alternatively, I can bid 5 of any digit, but that might be risky. So, I'll bid 4 zeros.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 1s. For the current bid of 4 1s to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least two more 1s, which is plausible but somewhat unlikely. However, since 4 is not an excessive number overall (it's only a quarter of all digits), it's still within a reasonable range. Challenging now carries risk. A safer strategy is to increase the bid slightly, perhaps to 4 3s, since I hold two 3s, which gives me a solid foundation for that bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s, meaning Player 0 claims that there are at least four '3s' across both players' hands. In my hand (35916285), I have exactly one '3'. This means Player 0 would need at least three '3s' in their hand to make their bid valid. Statistically, it is possible for Player 0 to have three or more '3s', but it is not guaranteed. Since the bid is not overly high and there is room to increase the bid strategically, I will raise the bid to 5 3s. This puts pressure on Player 0 to either challenge or raise further, giving me more information about their confidence in their hand.

Player 1 bids: 5 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. Looking at my hand (41103087), I have two 3s. For the opponent's hand to make the total reach 5, they would need at least three 3s. While it's possible, having three or more of the same digit in eight digits is somewhat unlikely. Given the bid history, Player 1 increased from 4 3s to 5 3s, which could be aggressive bluffing or confidence based on their hand. Since I hold two 3s, and requiring the opponent to have three is a stretch, challenging here is a reasonable strategic move rather than risking a higher bid.
