--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand (8 2 4 3 4 6 1 5), the digit '4' appears twice, which is the highest count of any digit in my hand. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 of 4s, as I know there are at least 2 in total, and likely more in the opponent's hand. This bid is conservative and puts pressure on the opponent to either raise or challenge early.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I don't have any 4s in my hand, so the total number of 4s can't exceed 2. Since Player 0 bid 2 4s, it's possible they are lying, especially because I have no 4s. Challenging is a strategic move to test their bid.
