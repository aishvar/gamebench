Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (25966382), I have: one 2, one 3, one 5, two 6s, one 8, and one 9. Since I have two 6s in my hand, that's a good digit to bid on. The other player might have some 6s as well. A conservative first bid would be '3 6s', suggesting there's at least one more 6 in the other player's hand, which is reasonable. I could bid higher, but starting with a moderate bid gives me room to maneuver later.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6 (digit string: 34073459). The current bid is 3 6s, meaning at least three 6s across both hands. Since I only have one, Player 0 would need to hold at least two 6s for their bid to be valid. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely given average digit distribution (each digit expected about 1.6 times per hand). A higher bid would require either 3 7s or 4 of any digit, but I lack strong holdings in any other digit to safely increase. Therefore, I will challenge, suspecting Player 0 may be bluffing or overestimating.
