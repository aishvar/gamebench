Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 5s and one 6 in my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 5.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s, and I have zero 5s in my hand. For the bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least three 5s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, this requires a relatively high concentration of 5s (3/8 of their hand). Given the low likelihood and my absence of 5s, challenging presents a favorable risk-reward scenario.
