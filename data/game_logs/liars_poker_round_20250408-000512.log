Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable move since I have two 6s and there's a possibility the opponent has one, making the total three. Challenging is risky as the opponent might have two 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, so the total number of 7s depends entirely on Player 0's hand. The current bid is 3 7s, and challenging it could be risky if Player 0 actually has three 7s. However, considering Player 0 is a Naive 50/50 player, they might have overbid. Challenging gives me a chance to win if the total is less than 3.
