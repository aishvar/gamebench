Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, the digit '2' appears three times, which is the most frequent digit I hold. Given there are 16 digits total, starting with a conservative but solid opening bid on '2's makes sense, as it's likely there are additional '2's in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s, meaning Player 0 is claiming there are at least three '2's across both hands. Looking at my hand (34890597), I have zero '2's. This means that Player 0 would need to have all three or more '2's in their hand for the bid to be valid. With 8 random digits in their hand, the probability of having three or more of a specific digit is relatively low. Therefore, it is unlikely that there are three or more '2's across both hands. Given this, I will challenge the bid as I believe it to be too high.
