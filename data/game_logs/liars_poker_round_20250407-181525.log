Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player, I need to make an initial bid. My hand contains two 9s, which is a strong starting point. Bidding two 9s is a reasonable move, considering the high value of the digit and the quantity I hold.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s. The current bid is 2 9s, which I already fully cover. Since my opponent made the bid, they likely have at least one 9, making the total likely at least 3. Therefore, challenging now would be risky. The next valid bid must be either 3 of any digit or 2 of a higher digit (which is impossible since 9 is the highest). The safest strategic move is to increase the quantity to 3 9s, which is plausible given my two 9s and the likelihood that my opponent has at least one.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. Since I have two 9s in my hand, the total could be 3 if Player 1 has one 9, or higher if they have more. However, I'm uncertain about Player 1's hand. Challenging the bid is a reasonable move, as it could reveal whether the total number of 9s is less than 3.
