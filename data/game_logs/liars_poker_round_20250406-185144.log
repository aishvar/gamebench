Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 2 8s is a safe and strategic move, as it's likely to be valid and provides a good foundation for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 5,7,6,5,1,6,1,7. I have zero 8s, so the current bid of 2 8s relies entirely on Player 0 holding at least two 8s. Given the total of 16 digits and the rarity of having two 8s in a single hand, this is somewhat unlikely. Since I have none, and the bid is relatively low but still suspicious, I believe challenging is the best move rather than risk bidding on a digit I have none of.
