Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a strong hand with multiple digits, including 5, 4, 7, and 2. Given the current bid is None, I should make a reasonable bid to start the game. I'll bid on a digit that is common but not too high, like 4 or 5. I'll choose 5 since it's present in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Bidding higher seems reasonable. I have two 6s, so I can bid 4 6s, increasing the quantity. This is a plausible bid given my hand and the lack of information about the opponentâ€™s hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 5 and two 6s in my hand. I can make a valid higher bid by increasing the quantity or digit. Since I have two 6s, I can safely bid 4 6s, which is the same quantity but a higher digit based on my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. I can increase both quantity and digit based on my hand. Bidding 5 6s is a reasonable move.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 6 6s is a reasonable increase in quantity. While I don't have many other high-value digits, increasing the quantity of 6s seems like the most logical play given my hand and the current bid. It's a slightly risky bid, but not excessively so.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have 6 in my hand, which makes a bid of 7 6s reasonable. It's an increase in quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 7 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding higher than 7 6s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit to 7 would require bidding 7 7s, which is possible but risky. Increasing the quantity to 8 6s is also possible. However, given the history, Player 0 seems confident in 6s. I will bid 8 6s to test their confidence, as I have two 6s and it's a reasonable increase. A challenge seems too risky at this point without more information.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 6s in my hand, specifically the digits 2, 5, and 6. The current bid is 8 6s, which seems plausible. However, I can improve this bid by increasing the quantity to 9, even though I only have three 6s. This is a strategic move to make a stronger bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 9 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding higher on 6s is risky as it's already a high quantity. I can bid 10 6s which would be a valid bid, or I can try a different digit. Given my hand, I have a 9, 8, 4, 3 (twice), 0. Bidding on 7s seems reasonable as I don't have any, and it's a higher digit than 6. I will bid 10 7s. This is a reasonable risk given the previous bids on 6s.
