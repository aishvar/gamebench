Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I can make an opening bid. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding a low quantity of 6s seems like a reasonable starting point. I will bid 3 6s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. I have two 6s in my hand, so if I bid '4 6s', I would be increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid '3 7s' or higher as it would be a higher digit. However, without knowing the exact distribution of digits in the other player's hand, I should make a conservative but higher bid. I will bid '4 6s' as it seems reasonable and increases the quantity.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 5 6s seems like a reasonable increase, and it's likely there are at least 5 sixes between both hands.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 8 digits per player, I should consider the likelihood of there being 5 or more 6s in total. Since I only have one 6, I need to be cautious. The bid seems potentially valid but I should consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. With my digits, I don't have enough information to confidently make a higher bid. However, I can challenge the bid if I think it's unlikely.
