Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid in the game. Looking at my hand (69230403), I have: one 6, one 9, one 2, one 3, two 0s, and two 4s. Since I have two 0s and two 4s, these are my strongest digits. I'll bid on 4s since they're a higher digit than 0s. I know for certain there are at least 2 fours in the game (in my hand), but I should bid higher to account for possible 4s in my opponent's hand. A conservative estimate would be to add 1-2 more, so I'll bid 3 4s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. I could bid 3 5s, which is a slightly higher bid. However, since I only have one 4, it's possible the other player is bluffing. I will make a slightly higher bid of 4 0s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze my hand and the current bid. In my hand (69230403), I have one 0. The current bid is '4 0s', meaning the claim is that there are at least 4 zeros between both players' hands. Since I have 1 zero, that would mean Player 1 needs to have at least 3 zeros for this bid to be valid. While possible, that's a significant number of zeros for one player. Each player has 8 digits, so the maximum possible quantity of any digit is 16. I could challenge, but there's a reasonable chance Player 1 has 3 zeros. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 3s and one 4 in my hand, but I'll bid on 4s since I already established some presence of 4s with my previous bid. I'll bid '4 4s', which is higher than '4 0s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, which is a valid higher bid than 4 4s. However, I also have two 8s. I could bid 5 0s or 5 8s. I think bidding 5 0s is a safer play since I don't want to overcommit to the number of 8s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand (the 4th digit). The current bid is 5 0s, which means there would need to be at least 4 more 0s in my opponent's hand for this bid to be valid. Since each player has 8 digits, it's certainly possible that my opponent has 4 or more 0s. I have two 4s in my hand, which I already bid on. Looking at my other digits, I have one 6, one 9, one 2, one 3, and one more 0. I could bid on 5 3s, but that would require my opponent to have at least 4 3s, which seems unlikely. I think a safer bid would be 5 4s, as I already know I have 2 of them, so my opponent would only need 3 more. Alternatively, I could bid 6 0s, but that would require my opponent to have 5 0s, which is quite high. Given the bidding history and my hand, I'll go with 5 4s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. Bidding 6 0s is a valid increase and doesn't rely on me having a lot of 4s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (69230403), I have 2 zeros. The current bid is 6 0s, meaning Player 1 is claiming there are at least 6 zeros total between our hands. For this to be true, Player 1 would need to have at least 4 zeros in their hand (since I have 2). While possible, having 4 of the same digit in an 8-digit hand is somewhat uncommon (probability around 14%). Given our bidding history, Player 1 has consistently bid on zeros, suggesting they might have several in their hand. However, 4 zeros seems like a stretch. I could challenge, but I'll play it safe and bid higher. I have 2 fours in my hand, so I'll bid 6 4s, keeping the same quantity but using a higher digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. It is possible that there are at least six 4s in total, but it is also possible that Player 0 is bluffing. Since I don't have any 4s, I'm less inclined to bid higher. I will bid 7 0s, increasing the quantity and using a digit I have one of.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 7 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (69230403), I have 2 zeros. The current bid is 7 0s, meaning Player 1 believes there are at least 7 zeros between our hands. Since I have 2 zeros, that would mean Player 1 needs to have at least 5 zeros in their hand for this bid to be valid. With 8 digits per player, having 5 of the same digit is possible but somewhat unlikely. Player 1 has consistently bid on zeros, increasing from 4 to 5 to 6 and now 7, which suggests they might have several zeros. However, 7 zeros total seems high. I could bid 7 1s or higher, but given the pattern of bidding, I think it's better to challenge this bid as it's reaching an improbable quantity.
