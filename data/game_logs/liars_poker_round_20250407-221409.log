--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 3 2s is reasonable because it uses my highest individual count, and even if the opponent has none, the total is exactly 3, making a challenge risky for them.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 7, 7, 4, 9, 8, 9, 8, 7. There are no 2s at all, which suggests the current bid of 3 2s relies entirely on Player 0's hand. Since each player only has 8 digits, for the bid to be true, Player 0 must have all 3 or more 2s, which is unlikely. Therefore, the probability that there are at least 3 total 2s is low, making this a good opportunity to challenge.
