Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have one '7' and one '9' in my hand. Starting with a bid of 2 7s is reasonable as it's a low quantity and a middle digit, allowing room for future bids.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 9s. The current bid is 2 7s, and since I have zero 7s, challenging is risky. Instead, bidding 2 9s is a safe move as the total will be at least 2, meeting the bid requirement.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s and one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s, which is a higher digit than my previous bid of 2 7s. Given that I have only one 9, it's possible that the total number of 9s is exactly 2 (since the other player might have one 9). Bidding higher would require either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since increasing the quantity to 3 9s seems risky (as the total might not be that high), and increasing the digit to 2 10s is invalid (digits must be 0-9), the best option is to challenge the current bid.
