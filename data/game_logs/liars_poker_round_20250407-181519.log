--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, the digit '3' appears twice, and '0', '1', '4', '5', '8', and '9' all appear once. To start conservatively, I should bid on a digit I have multiple of, increasing the chance that the total count across both hands is higher. Bidding '2 3s' is a safe opening because I already have two 3s, and there's a good chance the opponent has at least one more.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. Since my hand contains no 3s, the total count of 3s depends solely on the opponent's hand. Challenging risks losing if they have 2 or more 3s. Instead, bidding 2 8s is safer because I have two 8s, ensuring the total is at least 2. This bid is valid (higher digit than 3 at the same quantity) and forces the opponent to either challenge or escalate further.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 eights. Looking at my hand (14305983), I have one 8. For the bid to be valid, Player 1 must have at least one 8, or more than one combined. Since I have one 8, it's quite plausible that there is at least one more 8 in Player 1's hand, making the total two or more. Therefore, challenging now is risky. The safest move is to increase the bid. I can do this by either increasing the quantity to 3 of any digit, or bidding 2 of a higher digit than 8, which is 9. Since 9s tend to be rarer, a safer incremental bid is 3 of a digit I have multiple of. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s. So bidding 3 3s is plausible, as with two in my hand, only one more is needed from Player 1, which is likely. Thus, I will bid 3 3s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. My hand has no 3s (0 in my digits), so the total count of 3s depends entirely on Player 0's hand. Bidding higher (e.g., 3 of a higher digit like 8) is risky because my hand only has 2 8s, and challenging assumes Player 0 might not have enough 3s. Since the bid of 3 3s exceeds the likely average count (each player has 8 digits, so total possible 3s are 0-16, but realistically low), challenging is a calculated risk to test if Player 0 is bluffing.
