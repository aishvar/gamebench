--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits 8, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 1, 4. The most frequent digits in my hand are 5 and 0, each appearing twice. To make a safe and strategic opening bid, I will choose the digit with the highest count in my hand, which is 0 or 5. Bidding '2 0s' or '2 5s' is a reasonable opening move that reflects my hand strength without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 fives. Looking at my hand (96311867), I have zero fives. Since I hold no fives, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have both fives in their hand. While it's possible, it's somewhat unlikely given the distribution of digits. Given the risk of increasing the bid without any fives in my hand, and the reasonable chance the opponent does not have two fives, challenging is the optimal move.
