Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid of 2 5s is safe because even if the opponent has none, the total count (2) meets the bid requirement. This allows me to establish a baseline while maintaining flexibility for future moves.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: With my hand, I have 2 3s, 1 8 and 1 1. The current bid is 2 5s, which is relatively low. I should try to increase the bid by bidding a higher quantity or digit, considering my hand's strengths.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, meaning the opponent would need at least two 8s in their hand for the bid to be valid. Given the uncertainty of their hand and the risk that they might be bluffing, challenging the bid is a calculated risk. If the opponent has fewer than two 8s, the challenge succeeds. If they have exactly two, the bid stands. Considering the previous bid escalation from 2 5s to 3 8s, there's a reasonable chance the opponent is overbidding.
