Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. I should start with a conservative bid to gauge the game. My hand contains two 6s and two 4s. I can start with a low quantity and digit to test the waters.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 50290141, which contains one 4. The total count of 4s must be at least 1 (from my hand) plus at least one more from other players' hands, so it's plausible that there are at least 2 4s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. I have one 5 in my hand, so bidding 2 5s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit.

--- Turn: Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, which means there are at least 2 fives total. Since Player 1 has bid '2 5s', this is exactly what I know to exist. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity but increase the digit. Looking at my hand, I have one 6, one 9, two 5s, two 2s, one 1, and one 3. Since I already know there are at least 2 fives, I could safely bid '2 6s' (same quantity, higher digit). I only have one 6 in my hand, but there's a reasonable chance other players have at least one more 6 between them. Alternatively, I could bid '3 2s' since I have two 2s in my hand, and it's likely at least one more exists among the other players. I'll go with '3 2s' as it seems safer based on my hand composition.

Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 6, 7, 2, 9, 7, 4, 4, 0. I have a total of 2 fours, which can be useful. The bid of 3 2s seems low but I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid. Since I have two 4s, bidding 3 4s or higher seems reasonable if I think others might have a 4. However, I should also consider if challenging could be beneficial given the current bid and my knowledge of my own hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. My hand is 50290141, which contains one 4. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I see that I have two 5s, which is more than the current count of 4s in my hand. However, I need to consider the total count across all players. Bidding 5 4s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, bidding 4 5s is also valid as it keeps the same quantity but increases the digit. Given that I have two 5s, bidding 4 5s appears to be a safe and reasonable move.

--- Turn: Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s, which means Player 1 believes there are at least 4 fives total. Since I have 2 of them, this means Player 0 and Player 1 combined would need to have at least 2 more 5s between them for this bid to be valid. This is certainly possible. Looking at the bid history, Player 1 initially bid 2 5s, suggesting they have at least one 5. Player 0 never bid on 5s. I could bid 5 5s, but that would require 3 more 5s between the other players, which seems risky. I could bid 4 6s or higher, but I only have one 6 in my hand. I could also bid 4 7s or higher, but I don't have any 7s. Given that I have 2 fives and the bid is for 4 fives total, the current bid seems reasonable and I don't have strong evidence to challenge it. I'll increase to 4 6s since I do have one 6 in my hand, and this is the minimum valid raise.

Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains 67297440, which means I have 2 sixes. Given that the previous bids have been relatively conservative, I should consider if I can make a valid higher bid. A higher bid requires either a higher quantity or a higher digit with the same quantity. Since the current bid is 4 6s, I could bid 5 6s or change the digit to a higher one with a suitable quantity.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have the hand 50290141, which contains one 6. To determine the likelihood of the bid being correct, I need to consider the total count of 6s across all players. With one 6 in my hand, there are 7 other digits in my hand and 16 digits across the other two players' hands. The bid of 5 6s implies that there are at least 4 other 6s across the other two players' hands. While this is possible, it's a relatively high count. However, given the progression of the bidding, it seems the other players are being cautious and gradually increasing their bids. I can either challenge or bid higher. To bid higher, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 6 would be a significant jump, and I'm not confident in having that many 6s across the table. I can bid the same quantity with a higher digit, so bidding 5 7s is a reasonable move as it doesn't commit to a higher quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to evaluate whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (61239525), I have zero 7s. The current bid is 5 7s, meaning there would need to be 5 sevens between all players. Since I have none, the other two players would need to have all 5 between them. This is possible but not highly probable. Looking at the bid history, bids have been steadily increasing, and Player 1 has now bid on 7s, which I can't verify in my own hand. I have two 5s, one 2, one 3, one 9, one 6, and one 1 in my hand. I could bid 6 7s, but that's risky since I have no 7s. I could also bid 5 8s or 5 9s, but I only have one 9 and no 8s. Since the bid of 5 7s seems somewhat unlikely and I have no 7s to support it, I'll challenge.
