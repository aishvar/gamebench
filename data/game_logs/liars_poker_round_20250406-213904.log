--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 72884162, I have two 8s, two 2s, two 1s, one 4, one 7, and one 6. A conservative opening bid would be 2 8s, as I already hold two 8s myself, making it likely there are at least two in total. This is a safe and reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, which seems plausible given that there are two players and each has 8 digits. However, I do not have enough information to confidently make a higher bid. Since I only have one 8, I am inclined to challenge the current bid, as it is possible that the total count of 8s is less than 2, especially considering that I only have one 8 in my hand.
