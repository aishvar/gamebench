--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, which means Player 0 is claiming there is at least one more 8 in their hand. Given that, it's plausible they have at least one 8, making their bid valid. To increase the bid, I can bid a higher quantity or a higher digit. Since I don't have strong evidence to challenge, I'll make a conservative bid of 3 8s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 8s. If I challenge, the total must be at least 3, which would make the bid valid, and I would lose. Therefore, I will bid 4 8s, hoping the total is four or more.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which means the opponent must have at least three 8s. Given that the maximum possible 8s in the game is 16, but with only two players, it's unlikely the opponent has three 8s. Therefore, challenging the bid seems like the best move.
