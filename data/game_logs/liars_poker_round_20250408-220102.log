Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so any valid bid is acceptable. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 1 9s is a safe starting bid, as it's based on cards I know exist. It's a conservative approach to establish a baseline.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have exactly two 8s in my hand, so bidding 2 8s is guaranteed to be true from my perspective and validly outbids 1 9s by increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 3 8s would be a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have the potential to contribute to that count. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have two 9s, so bidding 2 9s would be a valid bid, but it doesn't leverage my 8. Bidding 3 9s would be a higher quantity bid, but might be risky. I think increasing the quantity of 8s is the safest option given my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I hold 2 eights in my hand, so it is likely the other player has at least 2 more, especially given they've been pushing the count of eights. Increasing the quantity from 3 to 4 seems reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. It's unlikely there are three more 8s in the other player's hand, but not impossible. However, bidding higher on 8s would be risky. I can bid 5 8s, but that's extremely aggressive. Instead, I will bid 1 9s, which is higher than the initial bid but doesn't commit me to a high number of a specific digit. This is a safer move than bidding higher on 8s, given my hand and the history of bids.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Given the bid history shows a clear escalation on 8s, and the maximum possible quantity is 16, bidding higher on 8s is risky. I could bid 5 8s, but that's very optimistic. Instead, I will bid 5 9s. I have two 9s in my hand, and it's a slightly higher digit than 8. This is a reasonable increase without being overly aggressive.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand, so for the total to be at least 5, the other player would need five 9s in their 8 digits. That seems very unlikely, so I will challenge this bid.
