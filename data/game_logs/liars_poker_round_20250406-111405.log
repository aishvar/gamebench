Player 0 response was not valid JSON after cleaning: 'To make my first bid, I need to analyze my hand and consider a reasonable starting point. My hand is 76631217. Let's count the digits:

- 7s: 2
- 6s: 2
- 3: 1
- 1: 2
- 2: 1

Since there are 3 players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 24 digits in play. My hand has 8 digits, so I have a direct view of 1/3 of the total digits.

Given that I have 2 sevens and 2 sixes, both of which are relatively high digits, I can start by considering a bid that reflects a digit I have. The current bid is 'None', so any bid I make will be considered valid as long as it's in the correct format.

A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but not too low. Since I have two 7s, bidding on 7s seems like a good strategy. A bid of '3 7s' or '4 7s' might be too aggressive without knowing the other players' hands, but it's a good starting point to consider.

Let's think about the total count of 7s. I have 2 sevens. Assuming the other two players might have a similar distribution (though this is a big assumption), there could be around 6 sevens in total. However, I should be cautious and not bid too high on the first round.

A bid of 'BID: 4 7s' seems reasonable because it's slightly above what I have, considering I have 2 sevens and there are two other players who might have some. It's a conservative increase and reflects a digit that I know is present in my hand.

Here's my JSON response:

Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid and I have the digits 76631217, I can see I have two 7s and one 1. A reasonable starting bid could be based on the most frequent digit in my hand or a digit I think might be common across other hands. I have two 7s, so bidding on 7s seems like a good start. I'll bid a quantity that is slightly higher than what I have, considering the total number of players.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (04475164). This means for the bid to be true, there must be at least five 7s among the remaining 16 digits held by the other two players. The expected number of 7s in those 16 digits is 16 * (1/10) = 1.6. Requiring 5 or more 7s is significantly above the expected value. Calculating the binomial probability P(X >= 5) for n=16 and p=0.1 suggests this is a very unlikely event (less than 2%). Therefore, challenging the bid is the statistically sound move. While I have three 4s, making a bid like '7 4s' would also be a significant bluff (requiring 4 more 4s from 16, probability ~7%) and challenging seems safer.
