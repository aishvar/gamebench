Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '38094263', I have no 0s. The current bid is only 1 0s, which is quite conservative since there are 16 digits total and 0s are fairly common. Given the low bid, it's very likely there is at least one 0 in Player 0's hand. Therefore, challenging now is risky. Instead, I can safely make a minimal higher bid. I notice I have two 3s, so bidding 2 3s is a safe and valid increase (quantity increases from 1 to 2).
