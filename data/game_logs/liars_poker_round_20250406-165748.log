--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 7s in my hand, which makes me think the current bid is reasonable. However, I also have a 6 and a 5, which could be useful for a higher bid. Considering the current bid, I should increase the quantity or the digit to make a valid higher bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. I could bid 4 7s, matching the quantity but increasing the digit, or bid 5 of any digit. Given that I have two 7s, bidding 5 0s is safer than bidding 4 7s, as the opponent might have several 7s. However, bidding 5 0s might be too risky. I will bid 4 7s.
