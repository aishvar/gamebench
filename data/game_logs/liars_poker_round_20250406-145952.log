Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 5s and two 4s in my hand. Bidding 3 5s seems like a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that other players have at least one 5.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I need to consider my own hand and the possibility of others' hands. My hand contains one 5 and other digits that could potentially be high. Since I have one 5, I know there are at least 2 5s in total (including mine). I also see a 7, a 9, and a 1, which could potentially be part of a higher bid if others have similar or higher digits. However, without knowing the distribution, I must make an educated guess. Given that I have one 5 and the bid is 3 5s, I should consider if I can reasonably increase the quantity or the digit. The current bid seems low, but I don't have enough information to accurately challenge without considering probabilities. A reasonable next bid could be to increase the quantity or the digit. I have a 7, a 9, and a 6, which could potentially be part of a higher bid. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. The bid of 3 5s seems potentially beatable with a higher digit, given that I have a 7 and a 9 in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 2, 1, 9, 8, 5, 9, 1, 8, which contains zero 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, meaning there must be at least three 6s among the combined 24 digits. Since I have none, the other two players would need to have all three or more 6s combined. Statistically, the average count per digit is about 2.4 (24 digits / 10 digits), so three 6s is plausible but not certain. Since this is an early bid and 3 6s is reasonable, I will increase the bid slightly by raising the digit to 7, maintaining the same quantity, which is a minimal but valid increase.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 7s in my hand, which makes this bid likely. However, I do not have any 8s or 9s, and I do not have enough digits to make a bid of 4 of any digit. Therefore, I should challenge the bid as it is unlikely that there are 3 7s across all hands.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
