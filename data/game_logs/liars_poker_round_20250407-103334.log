Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 75494653, which contains no 0s. Since the current bid is only 1 zero, it's quite plausible that Player 0 has a single zero in their hand. Challenging such a conservative opening bid is risky. Instead, I should increase the bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 4s, and two 9s. A safe and strategic move is to bid 2 of one of these digits, such as 2 5s, which is supported entirely by my hand and forces Player 0 to either challenge or raise.

Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 5s and one 6. The current bid is 2 6s, so I only have one of the required digit. Assuming a naive distribution, the opponent likely has about 1 or 2 sixes, making the total of 2 sixes plausible but not much higher. Since I cannot bid 2 7s (digit increase) without risking an immediate challenge, the next valid bid is 3 of any digit. Given I have two 5s, bidding 3 5s is a reasonable and safe incremental bid supported by my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 6s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s (digits: 75494653). The current bid is 3 6s, so with my two 6s, the opponent would need to have at least one more 6 for the bid to be valid. Given the naive opponent's random bidding style, it's plausible they have at least one 6, making the current bid reasonable. To raise, I can either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I have two 5s as well, bidding 3 7s would be riskier, but 3 9s (with one 9 in my hand) is less likely to be valid. The safer strategic move is to increase quantity to 4, choosing a digit I have some of. I have two 5s, so bidding 4 5s is a reasonable next bid, leveraging my hand strength.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 4 6s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 75494653, I have two 6s. The current bid is 4 6s, meaning there must be at least four 6s across both hands. Since I hold two, Player 0 would need to have at least two more 6s. Given the distribution, it's somewhat unlikely Player 0 has two or more 6s, as that would require them to hold at least 2 out of their 8 digits, which has a low probability. Therefore, challenging the bid is a strategically sound move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (Naive 50/50) bid of 4 6s.
