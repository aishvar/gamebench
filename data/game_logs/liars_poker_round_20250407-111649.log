Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand, which is the most frequent digit. The total number of digits is 16. The expected number of 3s across both hands is 1.6. Bidding slightly above my count (2) to 3 is a reasonable opening, assuming the opponent has at least one 3, which is statistically probable.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have one 4 in my hand (63347510). For the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 1) must have at least two 4s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of having two or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively low (approximately 18.7% using a binomial approximation). Given this low probability, the bid is likely false. Challenging is the statistically stronger move.
