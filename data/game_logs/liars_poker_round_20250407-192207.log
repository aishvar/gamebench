Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning we are starting the game. With my hand being '98075306', I can see I have 3 '0's, 1 '1' is not present, 1 '2' is not present, 1 '3' is not present, 1 '4' is not present, 1 '5' is not present, 1 '6' is not present, 1 '7' is not present, 1 '8' is not present, and 1 '9' is not present. Given that there are no bids yet and I need to make the first move, I should start with a low digit that I know appears in my hand to minimize risk and encourage further bidding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have a full knowledge of my hand, I should start with a conservative bid that is likely to be valid but not too high. My hand contains the digits: 9, 8, 0, 7, 5, 3, 0, 6. The highest count of any single digit in my hand is 2 (for the digit 0). I should bid on a digit that I have a reasonable count of and is high enough to be strategic but not so high that it's likely to be challenged immediately.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 3/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my first turn. I should start with a conservative bid to test the waters. I have a 3 in my hand, which is a relatively low digit. Given that there are 16 digits in total (8 from each player), bidding on a low digit with a low quantity seems reasonable.

Player 0 bids: 1 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 '3'. Looking at my hand (29268465), I have zero '3's. Since the total number of digits is 16 and the bid is only 1, it's very likely that Player 0 has at least one '3' in their hand, making the current bid quite plausible. Therefore, challenging now is risky. A safe approach is to increase the bid. The minimal valid raise would be either to 2 '3's or 1 of a higher digit (since digit increases take precedence after quantity ties). Given that I have three '6's in my hand, bidding 2 '6's is safer because I already hold the majority of that count. So, I will bid 2 '6's.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Analyzing the current bid of '2 6s' made by Player 1, I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is the best option. Given my hand is '98075306', I can count my digits to see if I can make a higher bid. I have one '6'. Since the current bid is '2 6s', to make a valid higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or the digit. I don't have enough '6's to increase the quantity (as I only have 1 '6'), so I need to bid on a higher digit. The highest digit I have is '9', '8', and there are no other '9's or '8's bid yet. However, I should check if bidding on a higher quantity of a lower digit or moving to a higher digit is strategic. Given that I only have one '6' and bidding higher on digit makes more sense than trying to out-quantity with what I have, I should consider if there's a strategic advantage in challenging or bidding higher on another digit.

Player 0 bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. Looking at my hand (29268465), I have one '8'. Therefore, for the bid of 2 8s to be valid, the opponent must have at least one '8'. Since it's quite common to have at least one '8' in 8 digits, the bid is plausible. Challenging now is risky. To raise, I can either increase the count to 3 of any digit or bid 2 of a higher digit (9). I have two '6's, so a safe incremental bid would be 3 6s, leveraging the two I hold and hoping the opponent has at least one. This is a reasonable and safe advance over the current bid.

Player 1 bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Analyzing the current bid of '3 6s' made by Player 1, I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is the best option. The current bid is 3 sixes. I have the hand: 98075306. I count 2 sixes in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and there are 2 players, the total count of 6s could be at most 16 if both players had all 6s, which is highly unlikely. Without exact information on Player 1's hand, I must decide based on probability and my own hand. Since I have 2 sixes, if Player 1 has at least 1 six (which is a given since they bid 2 sixes previously), the total count of sixes could reasonably be higher than 3 but not extremely high. However, I also need to consider if I can make a higher bid with another digit. I see I have 2 eights and 1 zero, 1 threes, 1 fives, 1 sevens, and 1 nines in my hand. A bid of '4 8s' seems plausible and higher than '3 6s'.

Player 0 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (98075306) and the current bid (3 6s), I see that I have one '6'. The bid of 3 6s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since I have one '6' and the maximum possible quantity is 16, I should consider if bidding higher is feasible or if challenging is more strategic.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s (digits: 29268465). The current bid is 4 6s, meaning there must be at least 4 sixes across both hands. Since I hold 2, Player 0 would need at least 2 sixes for the bid to be valid. The probability of Player 0 holding 2 or more sixes in 8 digits is moderate but not guaranteed. Bidding higher would require assuming at least 5 sixes total, which is unlikely given my hand. Therefore, the safer strategic move is to challenge the current bid, as it is more probable that Player 0 does not have 2 or more sixes.
