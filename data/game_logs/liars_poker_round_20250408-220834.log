Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand 71681702, I have two 1s, two 7s, two 8s, and two 0s. Starting with a conservative but solid opening bid, I will choose 3 8s, as I already hold two and there is a good chance there is at least one more between both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, so I only need the other player to have at least one 9 to meet a bid of three total 9s. This outbids 3 8s by keeping the same quantity and increasing the digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 71681702, I have no 9s, so the likelihood that there are 3 or more 9s across both hands is low since all 8 of my digits lack a 9. Given that, the opponent would need to have all 3 or more 9s in their 8 digits, which is improbable. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
