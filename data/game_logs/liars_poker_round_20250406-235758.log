Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there's no current bid, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 86095326, I notice I have two 6s and other digits. Since the goal is to make a bid that is reasonable and has a chance of being true, considering the total number of digits in play (16) and aiming for a digit that I have at least one of, bidding on a digit I have seems like a good strategy. Bidding on the 6s I have, increasing the quantity to at least match what I have plus one (to account for the possibility of the other player having some), seems like a cautious yet potentially winning strategy.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, meaning the opponent needs at least two 6s to make it valid. Since there's uncertainty about their hand, challenging tests their claim. Given the risk/reward balance and typical bluffing dynamics in early bidding, challenging is strategically sound here.
