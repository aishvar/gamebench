Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 9 in my hand and no 0s. The current bid is None. I should make a bid with a high digit to set the bar high.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 1 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since I have a few digits in my hand that could contribute to a higher bid, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. My hand contains a 6 and a 9, but not multiple 9s. I can start by bidding conservatively, increasing the quantity or the digit. A bid of 2 0s seems reasonable as a starting point, given that I have no 0s but have other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid in the future.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 2 in my hand. The current bid is only 2 0s. Bidding 3 2s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 2S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 6, 3, 9, 2, 5, 1, 1, and 6. I see that I have two 1s, but no 2s or higher quantity of 2s to directly counter the bid with a higher quantity of 2s. However, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 1s and the current bid is 3 2s, I can try to bid higher with a digit I have. I have two 6s, which could be useful. A reasonable bid seems to be increasing the quantity or the digit. I can bid 4 1s as I have two 1s and it's a higher quantity than 3, and 1 is lower than 2 but could be a safe bet given my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 9 and 8 in my hand. The current bid is 4 1s. Bidding 4 8s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more likely to succeed. My hand contains the digits 6, 3, 9, 2, 5, 1, 1, 6. I have a total of 8 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit across both players' hands is 16. I should look for a digit that appears multiple times in my hand to make a reasonable bid. I have two 1s and two 6s, and one 5. The digit 1 appears twice in my hand, and I know there are 4 8s already bid. I should consider if bidding higher on a digit I have or another digit could be reasonable.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 1S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. My hand contains 0 ones. Given the current bid, I don't have enough information to make a valid higher bid. However, I notice Player 1 has made a series of bids with decreasing digit values (8 -> 1), suggesting they might be trying to find a low digit to bid on. I should challenge to test this hypothesis.
