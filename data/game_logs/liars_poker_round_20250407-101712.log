Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 2, one 5, one 6, one 7, one 8, and two 9s. A safe and reasonable starting bid is on a digit I have multiple of, so bidding 2 9s leverages my pair and sets a modest opening bid.
