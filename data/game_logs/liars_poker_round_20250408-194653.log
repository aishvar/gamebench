Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, so I am guaranteed that there are at least 2 9s between both hands. The current bid is 1 0s, which can be safely overbid by increasing the quantity to 2. By bidding 2 9s I raise the bid to a level that is supported by my hand, making it a low‐risk move if challenged.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I hold only one 0 in my hand, so for the current bid of 3 0s to be true, the opponent must have at least 2 zeros in their 8 digits—an outcome that occurs with roughly an 18-19% chance. Given these unfavorable odds and considering that alternative bids (like 3 9s) would rely on lower probabilities (even though I have two 9s), the safest action is to challenge the 3 0s bid.
