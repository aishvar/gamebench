Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game, as the current bid is 'None'. My hand is 90554877. I should make a relatively safe opening bid based on my hand. I have two 5s and two 7s, which are the most frequent digits I hold. There are 16 digits in total (2 players * 8 digits). On average, any specific digit appears 1.6 times. Since I already have two 5s, bidding '2 5' is a plausible and safe opening bid, reflecting my hand's strength without being overly aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have the digits 36913048. I can see that I have one '5' and one '3', and other digits. To determine my next action, I need to analyze the bid. The bid '2 5s' implies that there are at least 2 fives across both players' hands. I have one '5', so the other player must have at least one '5'. I can either challenge the bid or make a higher bid. A higher bid can be made by either increasing the quantity or changing the digit to a higher one. Since I have one '3', I can consider bidding on '3's. There are potentially 2 '3's across both hands (one in my hand and potentially one in the other player's hand). I can bid '3 3s', which is a valid higher bid because '3' is greater than '2' (the quantity of '5s' bid).
