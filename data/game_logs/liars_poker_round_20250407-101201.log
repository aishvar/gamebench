Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 8, and one 9. A safe opening bid would reflect a digit I have at least one of, and a conservative quantity. Therefore, I will start with a minimal but reasonable bid of 2 3s, suggesting there are at least two 3s total in both hands.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 4. The current bid is 2 4s, so assuming the opponent has at least one 4 is plausible. To make a safe higher bid, I can increase the quantity to 3 for a digit where I have multiple instances. I notice I have two 3s, so bidding 3 3s is reasonable as it only requires the opponent to have at least one 3, which is likely given the total of 16 digits. Therefore, I will raise to 3 3s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 4. The current bid is 3 4s, which requires at least two more 4s in the opponent's hand. This is plausible but not guaranteed. To outbid, the next minimal bid would be 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand, so 3 5s would require two more 5s in the opponent's hand, which is equally plausible. Since the current bid is not outrageous and I have some coverage for 5s, making a conservative incremental bid of 3 5s is strategically sound to maintain pressure.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 41523980, which contains zero 6s. Given that there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in Player 1's hand, the total maximum is 16 digits. Since I have zero 6s, Player 1 would need to have at least 3 6s for the current bid of 3 6s to be valid. The probability of Player 1 having 3 or more 6s in their 8 digits is relatively low (roughly 15% or less). Given this, it's a good spot to challenge the bid rather than risk making a higher, potentially dubious bid.
