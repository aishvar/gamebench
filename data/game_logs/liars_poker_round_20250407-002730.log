--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid of two 6s is safe as the total count across both players must be at least 2 (my two 6s plus any in the opponent's hand). This sets a solid foundation and forces the opponent to bid higher, either in quantity or digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 6s, which makes it unlikely that there are many 6s overall. Since the current bid is only 2 6s, it's quite plausible that the opponent has two or more 6s themselves, so challenging now is risky. The minimal safe option is to raise by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity, so I will bid 2 7s, which is the smallest valid higher bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand has zero 7s, so the opponent must have at least two 7s for their bid of 2 7s to be valid. Given there are 16 total digits, the probability of them having â‰¥2 7s is ~18.7% (calculated via binomial distribution). Their bid escalation from 2 6s to 2 7s (same quantity, higher digit) suggests a potential bluff, as they could have bid higher quantities if confident. With an 81% chance their bid is invalid, challenging is statistically favorable.
