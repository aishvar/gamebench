Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 50127405, which contains two 0s, one 5, one 2, one 7, one 4. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and a digit that is relatively common or one that I have. I have two 0s, so bidding on 0s seems reasonable. A conservative bid would be to bid on the count of 0s that I know exists. Since there are two players and each has 8 digits, there are 16 digits in total. I have two 0s, so the minimum count of 0s is 2. I will bid 3 0s as my first bid, slightly increasing the quantity to account for the possibility that the other player might have at least one 0.
