--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make a bid. Given my hand contains 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, I can bid a digit that appears in my hand. Bidding a higher quantity than the current bid (None) is not possible, so I'll choose a digit that appears in my hand and make a quantity of 1. The digit 5 appears in my hand, so I'll make a bid of 1 5s.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 1 5s. Bidding 2 6s is a higher quantity and a higher digit, making it a valid and safe move since I already have two 6s.
