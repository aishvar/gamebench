Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s and two 8s. Bidding 4 7s seems reasonable, as it's a high quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 95621942, I only have one 7. For there to be 4 sevens total, my opponent would need to have 3 sevens in their hand. While possible, this seems unlikely given a random distribution. With only 8 digits in each hand, having 3 of the same digit is less probable. Additionally, this is their opening bid, which suggests they might be bluffing. Based on probability and the high initial bid, challenging seems like the best move.
