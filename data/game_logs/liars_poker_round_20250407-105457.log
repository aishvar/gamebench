Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 9s, two 8s, one 7, and one 5. The most common digits in my hand are 0s, 8s, and 9s, each appearing twice. A safe and strategic opening bid is 2 8s, leveraging one of these common digits to keep options open for raising or challenging later.
