Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have one '9' in my hand. Assuming my opponent has a similar distribution, I can start with a bid of 2 '9's. This is a reasonable starting point that is likely to be true, giving me room to increase the bid or challenge later.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 twos. In my hand, I have the digits 4, 0, 1, 8, 4, 2, 0, 1, which contains only 1 two. For the total count to be 9 twos, Player 0 would need to hold at least 8 twos in their hand. Given that each hand is 8 digits, this would mean Player 0's entire hand is almost all twos, which is highly improbable. The expected average count of any digit across both hands is around 3.2 (16 digits / 10 digits). A count of 9 is significantly above this average, making the bid very unlikely to be valid. Therefore, the optimal move is to challenge the bid.
