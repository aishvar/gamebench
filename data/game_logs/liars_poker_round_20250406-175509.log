Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative opening bid. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 3 7s seems like a reasonable starting point. It's unlikely my opponent has more than 14 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. It's plausible that there are at least three 8s in total. However, I can increase the bid safely to 4 0s as 0 is the lowest digit and increasing the quantity by 1 is a safe move. This forces the other player to make a more risky bid or challenge.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. I can increase the quantity to 5 1s, or bid a different digit with a quantity of at least 4. Given the bid history, I will bid 5 1s to try and push the other player to challenge or make a risky bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. I could bid 6 0s, 6 1s, or 6 2s or higher. Given that the other player is a Naive 50/50 player, they may be bluffing. However, I also don't have strong evidence to challenge. I will bid 6 0s, as it is a safe increase and doesn't rely on my hand.
