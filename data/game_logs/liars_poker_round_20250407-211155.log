Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. The digit '9' appears once in my hand. Assuming the other player also has a similar distribution, bidding '9' for a quantity of 2 is a safe starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 twos. Looking at my hand, I have 0 twos (digits: 6,6,3,4,2,0,0,8), so actually I have 1 two. Since I have only 1, for the total to be at least 9, the opponent must have at least 8 twos, which is extremely unlikely given there are only 8 digits in their hand. The probability of someone having 8 twos is negligible, and having 8 or 9 total twos is very improbable. Therefore, the bid of 9 twos is highly suspicious and likely an overbid. The best strategic move is to challenge this bid.
