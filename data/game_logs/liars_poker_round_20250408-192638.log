Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: With no current bid, I want to start cautiously. My hand (49088740) shows that I have two 8s, which means I'm guaranteed at least two 8s in the overall set of 16 digits. Bidding '2 8s' is a safe and logical opening move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, which I can exceed by bidding 3 5s. Since I already hold three 5s, even if the opponent has none, the total meets the bid. This is a safer raise compared to challenging or bidding a higher digit with insufficient evidence.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand (49088740) contains no 5s, which makes the current bid of 3 5s very unlikely given there are 16 total digits. Since I have 0 fives, the opponent would need all 3 of the bid 5s from their 8-digit handâ€”a highly improbable situation. Challenging the bid is therefore the best move.
