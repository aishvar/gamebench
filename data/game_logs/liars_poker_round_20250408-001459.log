Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. Starting the bidding with 3 5s is a reasonable claim, considering the possibility that the opponent might have at least one 5.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Bidding higher than 3 5s is possible. I have two 6s, so I could bid 4 6s. However, given I have no 5s and the opponent made the bid, it's likely they have at least one. Bidding 3 6s is a safer option as it only increases the digit, and I have two 6s. Bidding 4 0s is also possible, but less likely to be successful given the opponent's initial bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, making it unlikely that the total is 3 or more. Challenging the bid is a reasonable move as the probability of the bid being false is higher.
