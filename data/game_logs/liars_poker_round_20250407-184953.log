Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a relatively safe bid. I have two 2's in my hand. Bidding one 2 is too low. I will bid two 2's to start.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have zero 2s in my hand. It's very unlikely that there are two 2s total between both hands, making this a good opportunity to challenge. Even if Player 0 has one 2, they would need Player 1 to also have a 2. While possible, it's a reasonable risk to challenge.
