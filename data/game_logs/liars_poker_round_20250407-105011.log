Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game, and my hand is 10838528. Counting my digits, I have two 8s, two 5s, two 0s, one 1, and one 3. A sensible opening bid is usually conservative. Since I have two 8s, bidding 2 8s is safe, but the minimum opening bid is typically 1 of some digit. I'll start with a modest and plausible opening bid of 2 8s, reflecting my own hand and leaving room for escalation.
