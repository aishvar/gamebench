Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid, I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (89530541), I count the occurrences of each digit: 8(1), 9(1), 5(1), 3(1), 0(1), 4(1), 1(2). The digit '1' appears twice, which is the highest count. A reasonable starting bid could be the most common digit in my hand. I'll bid 3 1s, slightly higher than my count to give some room for the opponent's possible count.

Requesting action from Player 1 (anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 46425317, I have one 1. For the bid of '3 1s' to be true, Player 0 would need to have at least two 1s in their hand. While this is possible, I have several safer options for bidding. Based on my hand, I can see two 3s, which makes bidding '3 3s' a safer play - it's a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit) and I already know where two of them are. This is a conservative but strategic move that builds on known information.

Player 1 (anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. My hand contains one 3. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. I see that I have two 5s, so bidding 3 5s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit. Alternatively, I could bid 4 3s, but that seems risky as it increases the quantity. Given my hand and the current bid, bidding 3 5s seems like a safe and reasonable move.

Requesting action from Player 1 (anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (46425317), I have one 5. The current bid claims there are at least 3 fives total between both hands. Since I only have one 5, this means the opponent would need to have at least 2 fives in their hand for this bid to be valid. While this is possible, I can make a safer bid by going to 3 6s since I have a 6 in my hand. This increases the digit while keeping the same quantity, making it a valid higher bid that I'm more confident about.

Player 1 (anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. My hand is 89530541, which contains one 6. So, in my hand, there is at least one 6. The total count of 6s across both hands could be higher than 3. I can bid higher than 3 6s by either increasing the quantity or keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit. Since I have a 9 in my hand and there are likely to be more 9s across both hands, I can consider bidding on 9s. However, I should not overbid. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move as it increases the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I only have one 6. The opponent bid 4 6s, meaning they claim there are at least 4 sixes between our hands. Since I only have one 6, this would require them to have at least 3 sixes in their hand, which seems unlikely. Additionally, they increased both the quantity and kept the same digit from my previous bid of 3 6s, which could indicate a bluff. Given I know for certain there's only one 6 in my hand, I should challenge.
