Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the first bid. My hand contains two 0s, two 6s, one 1, one 5, one 8, and one 9. Bidding 2 0s is a safe starting point, as it is likely that at least two 0s exist in total across both players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s and one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 0s. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable increase in both quantity and digit, leveraging the digits I have in my hand. I could also bid 3 8s, but that would be riskier if the other player has no 8s. I'll go with the safer option.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, which means the total count of 5s across both hands is at least 3 (the current bid) but could be higher. However, I also have two 6s, which allows me to make a higher bid by increasing both the quantity and the digit. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move, as it increases both the quantity and the digit based on my hand.

Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. It's unlikely that the other player has more than two 6s, so challenging seems risky. However, I have three 5s, which means there are at least 6 5s in play. Bidding 5 5s is a reasonable move, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity plausible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 5S'
Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 5s. I only have one 5, so I cannot confidently bid higher on 5s. However, I can increase the quantity and digit by bidding 6 6s, which seems reasonable based on my hand and the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 6S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and I have two 6s, it's unlikely that there are 6 6s in total. Challenging seems like the best move.
