Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make a reasonable initial bid. My hand contains two 4s, and I assume the opponent might have a similar count. Bidding 4 fours is a moderate starting point that balances risk and potential for the opponent to challenge or outbid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s, meaning there must be at least four 4s across both hands. Looking at my hand (36777558), I have zero 4s. Since I have none, all four 4s would need to be in Player 0's hand. The odds of that are quite low, as four of eight digits being 4s is unlikely. Therefore, it's statistically improbable that the bid is valid, making a challenge the optimal move.
