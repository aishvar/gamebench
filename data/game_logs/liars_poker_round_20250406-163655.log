--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first turn, so I need to make an initial bid. In my hand, I observe two 7s and two 8s, which are relatively strong digits. To start conservatively and leave room for higher bids, I will bid 2 7s, as I have a solid basis for this bid based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (65838635), I have no 7s, which makes me skeptical about the current bid of 2 7s. Since I hold 2 6s and 3 8s, a safer and higher bid would be to increase the quantity to 3 and choose a digit I have multiple of. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable next move because I alone have 3, making it likely true or even conservative.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. In my hand, I have two 8s. This means there need to be at least one more 8 in Player 1's hand to make the bid valid, which is plausible. However, I can increase the bid strategically to maintain pressure. I also have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 4 7s increases the quantity and changes the digit, making it a valid and stronger bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (65838635), I have zero 7s, which makes the current bid of 4 7s quite suspicious. Since there are 16 digits total and I hold none, all four 7s would need to be in Player 0's hand, which is unlikely. The probability that a single hand contains four 7s is low. Therefore, challenging this bid is my best move.
