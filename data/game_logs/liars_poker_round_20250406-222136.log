Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a starting bid based on my hand. I have two 0s, two 9s, and one each of 1, 6, 7, and 8. I will start with a conservative bid of two 0s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand (82442737) contains no 0s, so the bid of 2 0s relies entirely on the opponent's 8 digits. Statistically, the chance that 8 random digits include at least two 0s is only about 18-19%, making the bid very unlikely to be correct. Therefore, I choose to challenge the bid.
