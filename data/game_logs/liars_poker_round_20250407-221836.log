Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 4s, two 1s, one 6, one 8. A safe opening bid is to call the quantity of a digit I have at least two of. I will start with 2 5s, as I hold two 5s myself, making this a conservative but solid opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (38298230), I don't have any 5s. The current bid of '2 5s' is relatively low considering there are 16 total digits in play. Even though I don't have any 5s, it's quite possible my opponent has 2 or more 5s. I notice I have three 2s in my hand, which gives me confidence to make a higher bid. I'll bid '3 2s' which is valid as it increases the quantity from 2 to 3, even though 2 is a lower digit than 5.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (51649584), I have no 2s at all. The current bid is 3 2s, which requires there to be at least three 2s across both hands. Since I have zero, the opponent would need all three or more 2s, which is quite unlikely given 8 digits. Statistically, the expected number of 2s across 16 digits is about 1.6, so 3 is a bit aggressive. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
