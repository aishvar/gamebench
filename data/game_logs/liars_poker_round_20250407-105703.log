Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Since I can't challenge the very first low bid effectively, and it's early in the game, the best strategy is to increase the bid conservatively. I have two 2s and two 8s, so bidding 2 2s is a safe and natural next step, increasing the quantity by one and choosing a digit I hold multiple times.
