Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: With no previous bids, I can start with a reasonable bid based on my hand. I have two 6s and two 8s, which are the highest digits in my hand. Bidding 4 6s seems like a good starting point, as it's likely to be valid and sets a benchmark for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is the best option. My hand contains the digits 6, 3, 4, 2, 7, 1, 9, and 8. I have one 6 in my hand. The bid of 4 6s seems plausible but I need to determine if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is more strategic. Since I only have one 6, bidding a higher quantity of 6s seems risky. I should consider bidding a higher digit or quantity that seems reasonable based on my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 7s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have two 7s, bidding 6 7s is risky. Instead, I can bid 5 8s, increasing the digit while maintaining the same quantity. This seems reasonable given my hand contains two 8s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. Given that I have one 8 in my hand and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I need to assess if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. Since I have to strictly increase the bid and I don't have enough information about Player 0's hand, I should consider what I can reasonably bid. I have one 8 in my hand, so I know there are at least 1 or 2 8s in total (considering Player 0 might have some as well). I can try to bid higher with a reasonable chance of having more digits than the current bid quantity. I will bid 6 8s or higher if I think it's unlikely, but I should also consider my own digits to make sure I have a valid chance of winning if challenged.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 6 9s. Given the bid history and my hand, it's unlikely there are 6 or more 9s in total. The maximum possible 9s in play is 2 (one in each player's hand), and I don't have any. Challenging seems the best move.
