Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9, one 8, one 6, and one 1 in my hand. Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable bid. Bidding 2 9s is a good starting point, as it's likely that at least one other player has a 9, and it's a high enough digit to make a challenging bid difficult for the opponent.

Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, making it unlikely that there are three 0s in total. However, I have two 9s, and the opponent has already bid 2 9s, suggesting they might have at least one 9. Bidding 4 9s is a reasonable bluff, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same.
