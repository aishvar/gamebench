Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 3, 0, 9, 8, 4, 1, 7, 5, which includes exactly one 0. Since the total digits are 16, it's quite likely there is at least one 0 in the other player's hand as well, making the current bid of 1 0s very safe. To increase the bid, I can keep the quantity at 1 and select a higher digit, such as 1 1s, which is the minimal valid higher bid. I have one '1' in my hand, so this is a safe incremental bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 30984175, I have the digits 3, 0, 9, 8, 4, 1, 7, 5. I have zero 2s, so any bid on 2s is purely dependent on Player 0's hand. The current bid is only 1 2s, which is quite conservative given there are 16 digits total. It's very likely Player 0 has at least one 2, so challenging now is premature. To maintain pressure and safely increase the bid, I can bid 1 3s since I have one 3 in my hand, making this bid truthful for at least my hand and likely plausible overall.
