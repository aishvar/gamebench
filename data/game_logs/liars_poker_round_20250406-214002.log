Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so any valid bid is acceptable. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 1 6s is a safe starting bid, as it's based on cards I know exist. It's also a low enough bid that it's likely to be accurate.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have a 6 in my hand, making the current bid of 1 6s valid. To make a higher bid, I choose a higher digit while keeping the quantity the same. Bidding 1 7s is a valid higher bid since 7 is higher than 6.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. I also have two 6s. Bidding 2 6s would be a valid and reasonable move, as it increases the quantity while staying within the realm of possibility given my hand. Bidding a higher digit is also possible, but less informed by my hand. Increasing the quantity of a digit I possess seems more strategic than guessing on a higher digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. If Player 0 has none, the total is one, making the bid invalid. If they have one, the total is two, making the bid valid. Challenging is risky but possible.
