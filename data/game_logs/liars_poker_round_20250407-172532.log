Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first turn with no existing bid, so I must start the bidding. Analyzing my hand, I have the digits 6, 4, 1, 6, 0, 7, 2, 5. The counts are: two 6s, one 4, one 1, one 0, one 7, one 2, one 5. The most frequent digit in my hand is 6 with two occurrences. A good opening bid is usually a conservative estimate based on my hand, assuming the opponent has at least one of that digit as well. Therefore, starting with a bid of 3 sixes (since I have 2, and it's plausible the opponent has at least 1) is reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the likelihood of the current bid of '3 6s'. In my hand of 13933149, I have 0 sixes. Since there are 2 players with 8 digits each, there are 16 total digits in play. The opponent claims there are at least 3 sixes total, which means they must have at least 3 sixes in their hand (since I have none). While this is possible, it's not extremely likely. The probability of having exactly 3 sixes in 8 random digits is about 21.5%. However, I need to either challenge or make a higher bid. If I bid, I could go to '3 7s', '3 8s', '3 9s', '4 0s', '4 1s', etc. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 1s, and one each of 9, 4, and 0. The most common digit in my hand is 3 or 1 (2 each). Since I have 2 threes, the opponent would need only 1 more three to make '3 3s' valid, which seems reasonably likely. I'll bid on 3s.

Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '3 6s' to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. In my hand (13933149), I have 0 sixes. The total number of digits across both players is 16, so there could be up to 16 sixes. However, since I have 0 sixes in my hand, all 3 claimed sixes would have to be in my opponent's hand. While this is possible, I need to decide if I should challenge or make a higher bid. Since this is the first bid and relatively low (only 3 sixes), it's reasonable that my opponent might have 3 or more sixes. I'll make a higher bid based on a digit I have multiple instances of in my hand. I see I have three 3s in my hand, so I can confidently bid at least 3 3s. To be safe, I'll bid 4 3s, assuming my opponent might have at least one 3 as well.

Player 1 bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. Looking at my hand (64160725), I have zero 3s, which means all 4 or more 3s would need to come entirely from Player 1's hand. Since each player has 8 digits, it's statistically unlikely for Player 1 to have all 4 or more 3s alone. Therefore, the bid of 4 3s is probably an overbid, making a challenge the best strategic move.
