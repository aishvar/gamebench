Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is 1 0s, there is at least one zero in play (mine). Given that the opponent has 8 digits, it's reasonably likely they might have another zero, so bidding 2 0s is a safe and minimal increase. This is a straightforward way to raise the bid while keeping risk low.
