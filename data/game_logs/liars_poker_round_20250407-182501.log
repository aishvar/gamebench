Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, the digit '1' appears twice, which is a solid starting point. Opening with a conservative bid on '1's is typical, as '1' is common and I hold two of them. This leaves ample room to escalate in future rounds.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. My hand contains one '1'. Assuming my opponent also has at most one '1', the total number of '1's in both hands is at most 2. Therefore, the current bid of '2 1s' is plausible. However, I can safely increase the bid. I will bid 'Q D', which means '2 2s'. My hand contains two '2's. It is likely my opponent has at least one '2', making a total of at least three '2's possible. Bidding '2 2s' is a reasonable step to probe further without taking excessive risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have one '1' in my hand. My opponent could have anywhere from 0 to 8 '1's. If they have 1 or more '1's, the bid could be valid. However, the probability of them having enough '1's to make the bid valid is not extremely high, especially given it's the first bid. Bidding '3 1s' is a reasonable increase, as it's not an extremely aggressive bid and still allows me to gather more information. Bidding a different digit would be riskier at this stage.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 ones. Looking at my hand (96151372), I have one '1'. For the bid to be valid, there must be at least 3 ones in total across both hands. Since I only have one, that would require my opponent to have at least two ones. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely given the distribution of digits. Additionally, since the bid is still relatively low and there is no obvious safer higher bid to make (e.g., 4 ones or 3 twos), the best strategic move is to challenge and potentially catch an overbid.
