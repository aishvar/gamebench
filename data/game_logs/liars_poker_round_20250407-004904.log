--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 61723459, I see each digit appears exactly once, so no digit is duplicated. The most conservative and safe opening bid is 1 of the highest digit in my hand to avoid overcommitting early. The highest digit I have is 9, so I'll start with '1 9s'.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I can see my entire hand (41767123) and there are no 9s in it. The opponent bid '1 9s', claiming there is at least one 9 across both hands. Since I have no 9s in my hand, this means they must have at least one 9 in their hand for their bid to be true. This is possible, so challenging would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, which gives me confidence to bid '2 7s'.

Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7. The current bid is 2 7s, which is plausible if the opponent holds at least one 7. Since I can't challenge at this low level confidently, my best move is to increase the bid slightly. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, so bidding 2 3s would not be valid as it's not higher. However, I also have two 9s, so increasing the quantity to 3 9s is a reasonable next bid, as I hold two myself and it pressures the opponent.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I can see my entire hand (41767123) and there are no 9s in it. For the bid of '3 9s' to be true, Player 0 would need to have at least 3 nines in their hand. While possible, this seems unlikely given they started with a conservative bid of '1 9s' and only raised to '3 9s' after my bid. They're likely bluffing. Since I can see zero 9s in my hand, and they would need 3 in their 8 digits, I should challenge.
