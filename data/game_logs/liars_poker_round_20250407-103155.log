Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I observe my hand '25239618' contains no 0s, making the current bid of 1 0s plausible but not guaranteed. Since the naive opponent likely made a conservative opening bid, I can safely increase the bid using digits I have. My hand contains two 2s, so bidding 2 2s is a reasonable and valid raise that leverages my known digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '25239618', I have one 3. The current bid is 2 3s, so for that bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least one 3. Given the distribution, it's quite plausible that there are two or more 3s in total. Rather than challenge a reasonable bid, I should raise. I also have two 2s, so a natural higher bid is 3 2s, which increases the quantity and is supported by my hand. The opponent already bid 2 2s earlier, so they might have at least one 2 as well, making 3 2s a safe and strategic bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (25239618), I have one 3. The current bid is 3 3s, which would require at least two 3s in Player 0's hand to be valid. The probability of Player 0 holding two or more 3s out of their 8 digits is relatively low. Since I only have one 3, and the total needed is three, challenging here is a reasonable choice as the bid seems somewhat optimistic.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (Naive 50/50) bid of 3 3s.
