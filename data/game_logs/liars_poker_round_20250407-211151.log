Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start by making the opening bid. Looking at my hand (65913271), the digit '1' appears twice, which is a relatively safe starting point. Opening with '2 1s' is conservative, but it sets a baseline and leaves room to escalate. Bidding on '1' is often strategic as it's a common digit, and with two in my hand, it is statistically likely there are more in the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (19304382), I see I have one '1'. The current bid is '2 1s'. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one '1', bidding a higher quantity is risky without knowing the other player's hand. However, I can try to bid on a higher digit. I notice I have one '3', and there are no '3's in the current bid. I also see I have other digits, but bidding on '3' seems like a reasonable next step. I will bid '1 3' as it's a higher digit than '1'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 1s'. I need to either make a higher bid or challenge it. Since I have two '1's in my hand (19304382), I know that there are at least 2 '1's in total. However, I also see that bidding '3 1s' would be a valid higher bid because it exceeds the quantity of the current bid. But first, I should check if there's a possibility to bid a higher digit or quantity that is more strategic.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (65913271), I have exactly one '1'. The current bid is 3 ones, meaning across both hands there must be at least three '1's. Since I have only one, the other player would need to have at least two '1's for the bid to be valid. While it's possible, it's somewhat unlikely given the average distribution (each digit appears about 1.6 times per player). The opponent increased from 2 to 3 '1's, possibly bluffing or confident. Overall, the probability they have at least two '1's is not very high. Therefore, challenging is a strategically sound move.
