Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand, so I can safely claim that there are at least two 2s in total. Starting with 'BID: 2 2s' is a credible opening bid that leverages my hand while keeping the bid conservative in a game where only 16 digits are in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s, and I have no 2s in my hand. Challenging this bid is a strategic move to test if Player 0 has at least two 2s, which seems uncertain given the lack of information about their hand.
