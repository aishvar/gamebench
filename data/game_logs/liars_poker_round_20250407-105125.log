Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Since I must make a strictly higher bid, the safest and most incremental raise is to bid 1 1s, which is the next digit up at the same quantity. This keeps the bid conservative while maintaining strategic flexibility.
