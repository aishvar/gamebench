Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid (Current Bid: None). My hand is 01615287. I have two 1s, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. With 16 total digits in play (2 players * 8 digits), the average count for any digit is 1.6. Having two 1s is slightly above average. Bidding '3 1s' is a reasonable opening move. It leverages the strength of my hand (two 1s) and assumes the opponent has at least one 1, which is statistically plausible.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze what I know and make a strategic decision. In my hand (19937567), I have one 1, which means there are at least that many in the game. The current bid is '3 1s', claiming there are at least 3 ones total between both players. Since I only have 1 in my hand, that means the opponent would need to have at least 2 ones in their hand for this bid to be valid. With 8 digits per player and random distribution, having 2 of any digit is quite reasonable. The bid of '3 1s' is fairly conservative and likely to be true. I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s and one 9, so I could bid on those digits. I'll bid '3 7s' which maintains the same quantity but increases the digit value, making it a valid higher bid.

Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (01615287). For the bid to be true, the opponent needs at least two 7s out of their 8 digits, which is plausible but not guaranteed. My strongest digit is 1, as I have two 1s. Bidding 4 1s requires the opponent to have at least two 1s. This seems like a reasonable escalation based on my hand, increasing the quantity and utilizing my most frequent digit. It's a stronger move than challenging a relatively low bid of 3 7s or bidding on a digit where I only hold one, like 3 8s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand (19937567). The current bid is 4 1s, which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 4 1s total between our hands. Since I only have 1, that means Player 0 would need to have at least 3 1s in their hand for this to be true. While possible, this seems somewhat unlikely. However, I need to consider that Player 0 initially bid 3 1s, suggesting they likely have at least 2-3 1s in their hand. Given this consistency in their bidding, I think it's reasonable to believe they have at least 3 1s, making the total of 4 plausible. I'll make a higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, so I'll bid 4 7s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (01615287). For the bid to be accurate, the opponent (Player 1) must have at least three 7s among their 8 digits. While possible, requiring 3 specific digits out of 8 from the opponent seems statistically less likely than them having 0, 1, or 2 sevens. Player 1 previously bid 3 7s and then raised to 4 7s after I bid 4 1s, which could be a bluff based on holding perhaps two 7s. Given I only hold one 7, challenging the requirement of three more from the opponent seems like a reasonable move.
