Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 3s, two 6s, and one 7. The highest count I can confidently bid on without overestimating is 2 3s, as it's a quantity I know exists in my hand and potentially in my opponent's.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have one 6 and one 7, and two other digits (8 and 6) in my hand, but no 3s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 3s, it seems reasonable to increase the digit. Bidding 2 6s is a safe start as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit, and I have one 6 in my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, making the total count of 6s at least 4 (2 from my hand and 2 from the opponent's hand). I also have a 3 in my hand, but bidding on 6s seems more promising given the current bid. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s and the bid is only for 2 6s, I can reasonably bid higher. I will bid 3 6s, increasing the quantity.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (2868567), so I know there are at least 2 6s. The total count of 6s could be 4 or more if Player 0 has one or more 6s. I can bid higher than 3 6s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move as it increases the quantity. However, I can also consider bidding 3 7s, which is also a valid higher bid. Given that I have no information about 7s in my hand or Player 0's hand, I'll play it safe and bid 4 6s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, and I know that Player 1 (llama-4-maverick) bid 4 6s previously. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 8 digits per player, I should assess the likelihood of there being 4 or more 6s in total. Since I have 2 sixes and my opponent could have up to 8 sixes, but we have no information suggesting they have more than 2, I should consider if my bid could be higher and still valid. I can see that bidding 5 6s would not be wise as it seems unlikely I have enough information to guarantee a win. However, I can try to increase the quantity or digit. I will increase the digit to 7 and keep the quantity low.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. My hand is 28068567, which contains one 7. I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Since I have one 7, it's possible that there are 5 or more 7s in total. However, I can bid higher. The next possible bid can be either 5 8s or 6 0s. I will choose to bid 5 8s as it is a more conservative move and keeps the quantity the same while increasing the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that this bid can be beaten. My hand contains the digits 3, 7, 7, 4, 6, 8, 3, and 9. I have a total of 8 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit across both players' hands is 16. Given that the bid is 5 8s, I should consider if I can reasonably make a higher bid or challenge. Since I have two 6s and the previous bids have included 6s, I can consider increasing the quantity or the digit. However, I don't have any 8s or any information that my opponent has more than 5 8s. I should consider making a bid that seems plausible given my hand and the bid history.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. My hand is 28068567, which contains one 6 and no 9s. I need to make a bid that is higher than 6 9s. I can either bid a higher quantity of 9s or the same quantity of a higher digit (which is not possible since 9 is the highest digit). The next possible bid would be to increase the quantity, so I should bid at least 7 9s. Given that I have no 9s, and assuming my opponent might have some, bidding 7 9s is a reasonable risk. It's also possible that my opponent is bluffing, but without more information, I'll take a cautious approach and make a slightly higher bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 7 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. Given that I have a 9 in my hand and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I need to assess if bidding higher is reasonable or if challenging is more likely to succeed. My hand contains 2 9s and I know there are 8 digits in total (4 from each player). The last bid was 7 9s, so I need to consider if I can reasonably make a higher bid or if challenging is more strategic.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 8 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 9s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. Since my hand is 28068567, I have two 6s, two 8s, and one 7. I don't have any 9s. The presence of 8 9s seems unlikely but possible. However, bidding 9 9s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity. I will make this bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 9 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 9s, made by Player 1. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 8 digits per player, I must assess the likelihood of there being 9 or more 9s in total. Since each player has 8 digits and the bid is already quite high, I need to consider if it's plausible or if I should challenge. With my hand being 37746839, I have one 9 but no information about Player 1's hand. The bid seems suspiciously high given the constraint of 16 total digits, but I don't have enough information to be certain. However, I can see that bidding higher than 9 9s requires a quantity higher than 9 or a higher digit with the same or higher quantity. I will challenge the bid because it seems extremely high given the constraints of the game and the hands.
