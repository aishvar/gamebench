Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. Since the total digits across both players is 16, and the current bid is None, starting with a bid of 2 1s is safe. Even if the opponent has zero 1s, the total (2) meets the bid quantity. This forces the opponent to either bid higher or challenge, but they cannot successfully challenge this bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. In my hand, I have no 1s, making it less likely that there are many 1s overall. However, I do have two 2s, which makes it reasonable to bid 3 2s. This increases the quantity and moves to a digit I have in my hand, staying within a plausible range.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 2s in my hand. The opponent's bid of 3 2s requires them to have all three 2s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player holding three 2s in 8 random digits (assuming uniform distribution) is approximately 3.8%, making this bid statistically unlikely. Challenging now has a high success probability.
