Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 3's in my hand. Bidding one of a common digit like 3 is a safe opening.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 count of digit 3 across both hands. Looking at my hand (16083052), I have zero 3s. Since the opponent was willing to bid 1 3s, they likely have at least one 3. Given there are 16 total digits and only a bid of 1, it's very plausible that at least one 3 exists in total, so challenging is risky. To continue the game strategically, I should increase the bid. A minimal safe raise is 1 5s, since I hold two 5s, making this a solid bid supported by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. To bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. I could bid '1 6s' or '2 3s' (since I have two 3s). I will bid 2 3s, as I know I have at least two 3s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (16083052), I have zero 3s. The current bid is 2 3s, meaning the opponent claims there are at least two 3s across both hands. Since I have none, this would require the opponent to hold both 3s, which is possible but somewhat unlikely given random distribution. Given the opponent previously increased the bid on 3s, they might have one or two 3s, but it's risky to assume two. Therefore, challenging is a reasonable move here rather than bidding higher.
