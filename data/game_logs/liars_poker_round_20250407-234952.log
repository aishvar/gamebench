Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to make an initial bid based on my hand. I have two 2s, one 0, one 7, one 5, one 6, and one 1. The most frequent digit in my hand is 2, so I'll start with a conservative bid of two 2s to set the baseline.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid is 2 2s. Bidding 2 3s is a valid higher bid because it maintains the quantity but increases the digit. Since I already hold two 3s, the total count of 3s across all players must be at least two, making this a safe and strategic bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 2 3s, which means the opponent is claiming there is at least one more 3 in their hand. Given that the bid is still low, it's reasonable to assume they might have at least one 3. I can either bid higher or challenge. Since I don't have strong evidence to challenge, I'll make a conservative higher bid by increasing the digit to 4, which I have one of in my hand.

Player 0 bids: 2 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 4s in my hand. The opponent's bid of 2 4s requires at least two 4s in their own hand since I have none. Statistically, the probability of them holding ≥2 4s in 8 digits is low (~18% assuming uniform distribution). Given the risk/reward and their pattern of incrementing digits (2s → 3s → 4s), challenging now has a high likelihood of success.
