Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 0s, one 2, one 4, one 8, and one 9. A common opening bid is 2 of a digit I have multiples of, as it's conservative and supported by my hand. I'll open with 2 3s, since I hold two myself, making it likely or safe.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 4. The current bid is 2 4s, so for that to be true, the opponent must have at least one 4 as well, which is plausible. Since I have one 4, a safe incremental bid would be 2 5s, but that only increases the digit, not the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 3 of a digit I have multiple of. I have two 3s, so bidding 3 3s is reasonable, as it requires the opponent to have at least one 3, which is likely across 8 digits. Therefore, I will raise to 3 3s.
