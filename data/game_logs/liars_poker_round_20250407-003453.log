Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 8 digits in my hand, so I should bid on a quantity that is larger than 0. I notice that I have two 7s, so I should increase the quantity for 7s. The current bid is None, so I can start with a small quantity and a high digit. Given my hand, bidding 1 7s seems like a reasonable starting bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, and the current bid is 1 7s. Since I have at least one 7, I can safely increase the bid. Bidding 2 7s is a reasonable move, as it increases the quantity while keeping the same digit.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 7s. Since there are only 16 total digits in play, the maximum possible 7s is 2 (one from each player). Bidding higher is not feasible, and the current bid seems unlikely. I should challenge.
