Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a reasonable bid based on my hand. I have two 6s, so bidding 3 6s is a safe starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 6.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which means there must be at least two more 6s in Player 0's hand. However, I can increase the quantity to 4 and choose a digit I have more of, like 9, as I have two 9s in my hand. This seems like a reasonable bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have two 6s in my hand, which makes a bid of 5 6s reasonable since it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid. This bid seems plausible given the information available.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 5 6s, which means there must be at least 5 sixes in total. Since I only have one 6, the opponent must have at least 4 sixes. Given the bid history, the opponent has been increasing the quantity of 6s, suggesting they might have a strong hand in 6s. To make a higher bid, I would need to either increase the quantity to 6 6s or switch to a higher digit with at least 5 occurrences. However, I only have one 6 and no other digit with 5 or more occurrences. Therefore, challenging seems more reasonable than risking an invalid bid.
