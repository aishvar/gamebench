Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. I'll start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s and two 7s. A bid of 2 7s seems reasonable as a starting point.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s and one 2 in my hand. The current bid is only 2 7s. Bidding 3 9s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 7, 6, 0, 7, 8, 1, 6, and 8. I can see that bidding 4 or more of any digit seems risky given the total number of digits available (16). However, I do have two 6s and two 7s and one 8. A reasonable bid seems to be increasing the quantity or digit. Since I have two 7s and two 6s are not available but two 6s and two 8s are present, I can safely bid on a digit I have. The current bid is 3 9s, so I should bid higher than 3 or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. I have two 7s and two 6s and two 8s; bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit compared to 3 9s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 5 6s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, and I know there are 8 secret digits for each player. Given that the previous bid was 5 6s and I have two 6s, I should consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since my hand contains two 6s and I do not know the distribution of other digits, I should assess if bidding higher is reasonable or if challenging is more likely to succeed.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity and keeping the same digit. Bidding 7 6s seems reasonable.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 7 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have two 6s in my hand and the bid history shows increasing quantities for 6s. Given that I have a total of 4 sixes in my hand (if I count them correctly), I should challenge this bid as it seems highly unlikely that there are 7 sixes in total between both players' hands.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) challenges Player 1's (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bid of 7 6s.
