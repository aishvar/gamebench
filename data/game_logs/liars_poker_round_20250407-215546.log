Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand 63417478, the digit '4' appears twice, '7' appears twice, '3' and '6' and '1' and '8' appear once each. Opening with a bid on a digit I have multiple of is strategic, as I know at least two exist. Therefore, starting with '2 4s' is a safe and strong opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Let me analyze my hand and the situation. In my hand, I have zero 4s. The opponent bid '2 4s', claiming there are at least 2 fours total between both hands. Since I have none, all claimed fours would have to be in their hand. While it's possible they have 2 or more 4s, I need to consider that they might be bluffing with their opening bid. Given that I have zero 4s and they would need at least 2 to make their bid valid, challenging here is a reasonable move. The alternative would be to bid higher (like '2 5s' or '3 2s'), but with incomplete information about their hand, challenging their opening bid is the safer play.
