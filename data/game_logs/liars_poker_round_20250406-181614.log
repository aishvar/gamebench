Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is relatively balanced with no clear majority digit. The current bid is None, so I should make a bid that's a reasonable starting point. I have two 5s and two 8s, but no other digit is particularly prominent. Bidding 2 5s or 2 8s seems like a good initial move, increasing the quantity and digit based on my hand.
