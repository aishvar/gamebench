Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 7, one 2, one 8, one 0, one 5, four unique digits, and two 7s (wait, no, one 7). The most common digits in my hand are 7, 2, 8, 0, 5, 4, 9, and 7â€”each occurring once. With no information on the opponent's hand, the safest opening bid is 2 of a digit I have, as the total number of any digit across both hands is likely to be at least two. I will choose a middle digit, say 7, since I have one 7, making '2 7s' a reasonable and safe opening bid.
