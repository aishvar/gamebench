--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, one 6, one 4, two 9s, and one 0 and one 1. Statistically, with 32 digits in total, the average count for any digit is about 3.2. Given I hold two 8s, it's likely there are at least one or two more 8s among the other players. Therefore, opening with a conservative but reasonable bid of 3 8s makes sense.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 3 8s in total. Given that I have one 8 in my hand, and there are 8 secret digits per player, I should consider the probability of other players having 8s. Since I only have one 8, bidding higher seems risky without more information. However, I can try to make an educated guess based on the information available. If I bid 4 8s or higher, I risk being wrong if many players have multiple 8s. A safer approach might be to bid slightly higher than 3 8s, considering the same digit or increasing the quantity slightly with a higher digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I need to bid higher than this. My hand is 77395639, which contains no 9s. The maximum quantity for any digit is 32, and there are 4 players with 8 digits each. Bidding 5 0s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity and changes the digit to a lower one, which is still a valid bid. I should make this bid.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 5 0s, which seems high given that there are only 32 digits in total (4 players * 8 digits each). The probability of there being at least 5 0s across all hands is low, especially since the previous bids were lower in quantity. Therefore, challenging the current bid is the most strategic move.
