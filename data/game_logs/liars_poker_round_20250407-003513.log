--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game and there is no current bid to compare against. I have two 1s and two 9s in my hand, which are the highest frequency digits I possess. Bidding 4 1s seems reasonable as it maximizes both quantity and digit based on my hand, and there's a chance the other player might also have 1s, making this bid plausible.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 1s. Bidding 5 7s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 7s. With only 16 total digits in play, it's unlikely there are 5 or more 7s. I should challenge the bid.
