Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand, so it is likely there is at least one more 4 among your eight unknown digits. I'll start with a modest bid of 3 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 3 4s and analyzing my hand 17385976, I notice I have one 7, one 3, three 8s, one 5, one 9, and one 6. Since my hand does not contain any 4s, and considering the opponent has already bid 3 4s, I must decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. Given that I don't have any 4s and the highest digit I have in abundance is the 8, which appears three times, making a bid on 8s could be risky without knowing the opponent's hand. However, since I need to make a strictly higher bid, and considering the distribution of my digits, bidding on a higher digit or increasing the quantity seems necessary. The opponent's bid of 3 4s suggests they might have at least one or two 4s, but without more information, challenging seems like a gamble. Instead, I will focus on what I can control - my knowledge of my hand and the need to increase the bid. Since I have three 8s, and the current bid is on 4s, I can try to bid on a higher digit or the same digit with a higher quantity. Given my hand and the goal to make a higher bid, I will choose to bid on 8s, as it's a digit I have in relative abundance compared to others, and it's higher than 4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand, so the other player would need at least three 8s in theirs to meet the bid of 3 8s. That seems quite unlikely, so I will challenge.
