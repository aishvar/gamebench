Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s, two 4s, one 8, one 9, and one 3 in my hand, which gives me a total of 7 digits. Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make a valid bid. I can confidently bid 2 7s since I have two of them, and it's a reasonable start for the game.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (65525708). For the bid to be true, the opponent only needs one 7 in their 8 digits, which is quite likely. Challenging seems risky. My hand contains three 5s, one 6, one 7, one 0, one 2, and one 8. My strongest digit is 5. A bid of '3 5s' is higher than '2 7s' (higher quantity). Since I already have three 5s, this bid is guaranteed to be true regardless of the opponent's hand. This is a safe bid that leverages my hand's strength and forces the opponent to make a higher bid (at least 3 6s or 4 of any digit).

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 5s. Since I have a strong digit (7) and I can increase both the quantity and the digit, I can bid 4 7s. This is a valid higher bid and leverages my hand effectively.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 65525708. I have three 5s and one 7. The current bid is 4 7s, made by Player 0. For this bid to be true, Player 0 must hold at least three 7s (since I have one). This is statistically possible but less likely than average (expected 0.8 7s in their hand). Player 0 started with 2 7s and raised to 4 7s after my bid of 3 5s, suggesting they might have some 7s, but it could also be a bluff. Instead of challenging, I can leverage my strong hand in 5s. Bidding 5 5s requires a total of five 5s across both hands. Since I have three 5s, Player 0 only needs to hold two 5s for my bid to be true. This is statistically more plausible than Player 0 holding three 7s. Making this bid puts the pressure back on Player 0.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand and no 5s. The current bid is 5 5s, which seems high considering I have no 5s. I can bid 6 7s, which is a valid higher bid since it increases both the quantity and the digit.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (65525708). For the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least five 7s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of having 5 or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is very low. Player 0 has consistently bid 7s (2 7s, 4 7s, 6 7s), but escalating to 6 requires a very strong hand in 7s (5+). Given my single 7, it's highly probable that the total number of 7s across both hands is less than 6. Therefore, challenging is the statistically advantageous move.
