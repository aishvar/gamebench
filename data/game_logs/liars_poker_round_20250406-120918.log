Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 2s and two 6s. Starting with a bid of 2 6s is reasonable as it reflects the count in my hand and leaves room for others to raise.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. I have a few 6s in my hand, but I also need to consider the possibility of other players having 6s. A reasonable next bid could be to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have the exact count of 6s across all players, I should consider what I can reasonably bid with my hand and the information given. My hand contains one 6, so bidding higher on 6 or moving to a higher digit could be strategic. However, without exact information on other players' hands, I must make an educated guess.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. With 32 total digits in play, the expected average for any digit is 3.2. Therefore, 3 6s is a statistically likely bid, making a challenge risky, especially since I hold zero 6s. My hand is 32435893, and I have three 3s. This is a strong concentration of a single digit. Bidding based on this strength is a good strategy. A bid of 4 3s is higher than 3 6s (higher quantity). Given my three 3s, needing only one more 3 among the other 24 digits held by the other players makes this a credible and strong bid.

--- Turn: Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. My hand is 87984856, which contains two 8s and no 3s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 3s, I suspect the total count of 3s might be less than 4, but I shouldn't challenge yet as it's Player 2's bid and they might have some 3s. I see that bidding 4 4s is a valid move as it increases the digit. However, considering my hand doesn't have any 3s or 4s, and there are 24 other digits among the other players, it's possible they have some 3s or 4s. I will increase the digit to make a new bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 4 4s, which means there would need to be at least three more 4s among the other three players' hands (total of 24 digits). While possible, it's a relatively high bid given the current state. I don't have strong evidence to challenge, but I can make a safer bid by increasing the digit to 5, which I also have one of in my hand. Bidding 4 5s is a conservative move that keeps the game going without taking a big risk.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Given that there are 32 digits in total and 8 digits per player, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. The bid of 4 5s seems plausible but not extremely high. I have a 7 in my hand which could be useful. However, bidding 5 7s seems reasonable as it's higher than 4 5s and I have one 7.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have zero 7s in my hand (32435893). While 5 7s out of 32 total digits is slightly above the average expectation (3.2), it's not extremely unlikely. Challenging is an option, but risky. I have three 3s in my hand, which is a significant amount. Bidding based on my strength seems safer and strategically sound. A bid higher than 5 7s could be 6 3s. This requires only 3 more 3s among the other 24 digits held by the other players (3/24 = 12.5% frequency), which is statistically plausible and close to the expected average. This bid leverages my strong hand in 3s and is consistent with my previous bid of 4 3s.

--- Turn: Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. My hand is 87984856, which contains two 3s (at positions 4 and 6, 1-indexed). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 3s, it's plausible that there are at least 6 3s in total. However, I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I see that there's a possibility of increasing the digit. Bidding 6 4s is a reasonable next step as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, and I have two 4s in my hand, making it somewhat plausible.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 6 4s, which seems high given that there are only 32 digits in total and 4 players. The bid history shows aggressive bidding, but with only one 4 in my hand, the likelihood of there being 6 4s across all hands is low. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
