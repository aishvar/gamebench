Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid. My hand contains the digits 3, 0, 9, 4, 7, 1, 6, and 9. I see that I have two 9s and two 6s. A reasonable starting bid could be 2 6s or 2 9s. I choose to bid 2 9s as it's a higher digit and I have two of them.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. I could bid higher, but it's early in the game, and I don't have enough information to confidently increase the quantity or the digit. Since the bid is relatively low, it's plausible. I will bid slightly higher by increasing the quantity to 3 and choosing a digit I have in my hand to avoid immediate failure if challenged. I have two 5s in my hand, so I'll bid 3 5s.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 3, 0, 9, 4, 7, 1, 6, and 9. I can see that bidding 3 or more of a higher digit or increasing the quantity and maintaining a high digit could be strategic. Since I have two 9s, I can confidently increase the quantity or digit. The bid '3 5s' seems low, and I have a 9 in my hand. I can increase the quantity or the digit. A reasonable bid would be to increase the digit and try to maintain a higher quantity if possible.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. It's possible my opponent is bluffing. However, I can make a slightly higher bid. I will bid 5 0s. This is a valid bid as it increases the quantity and is a safe digit as I don't have any.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid can be beaten. My hand contains the digits 3, 0, 9, 4, 7, 1, 6, and 9. I have a total of 2 nines. The last bid was 5 0s, so I need to make a bid that is either higher in quantity or digit. Since I have two 6s and two 9s, and my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I can consider bidding on a digit I have. The current bid is 5 0s, so I should bid higher than 5 or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. I have two 9s, so bidding 6 9s seems reasonable as it's higher than 5 and I have the digits to support it.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. The maximum possible number of 9s is 16. 6 9s is a relatively high bid early in the game, but not impossible. I could bid 7 0s, but I'm not confident about the number of 0s. Challenging has a reasonable chance of success, as my opponent might be bluffing.
