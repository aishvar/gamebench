Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I see three 0s (digits: 5, 1, 8, 7, 2, 0, 6, 0). Since I alone have three 0s, the total number of 0s across both hands is at least three, making a bid of 3 0s very safe. The current bid is only 1 0s, so I can confidently raise to 3 0s.

Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 5, 1, 8, 7, 2, 0, 6, 0. I have one '1' and two '0's. The current bid is 3 1s. Since I only have one '1', for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least two '1's. Given the distribution, three '1's across both hands is plausible but not very likely. An alternative is to raise the bid. Since I have two '0's, bidding 4 0s increases the quantity and leverages my stronger count. This is a safer strategic move than challenging now, as 3 1s is still somewhat plausible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 4 1s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 51872060, I have zero 1s. Since the total digits are 16, and I have none, all 4 claimed 1s would be in Player 0's hand. The probability that Player 0 has 4 or more 1s in 8 digits is quite low (binomial probability is small). Given this, it's unlikely the bid of 4 1s is valid. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (Naive 50/50) bid of 4 1s.
