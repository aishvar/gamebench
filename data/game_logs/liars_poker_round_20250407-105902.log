Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, which already meets the current bid of 1 0s. Since there are 16 digits total, it's very likely that there are additional 0s in Player 0's hand. A natural and safe progression is to increase the quantity by one while keeping the digit the same, so I will raise to 2 0s.
