Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 4s, one 0, one 5, one 6, and one 2. The most common digits are 2s (three times) and 4s (two times). Starting conservatively, I will open with a bid of 3 2s, reflecting my strong holding in 2s and leaving room for escalation.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 2s, one 3, and two 4s. The current bid is 3 3s, and since I only have one 3, for that bid to be true, the opponent would need to have at least two more 3s. This is plausible but not certain. Instead of challenging now, a safer strategy is to increase the bid slightly. Since I have two 4s, bidding 3 4s (same quantity, higher digit) is a valid, conservative increment that leverages my hand strength.
