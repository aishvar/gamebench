Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 zero. Looking at my hand (81962284), I have zero zeros. Since each player holds 8 digits, the total number of digits is 16. The naive opponent made the opening bid of 1 zero, which is a very conservative bid. Statistically, zeros appear roughly 1.6 times per player (assuming uniform distribution), so about 3.2 zeros total. Given that I have zero zeros, it is quite plausible that the opponent has at least one zero, validating their bid. Since challenging such a low opening bid is risky, the best strategy is to increase the bid conservatively. The next minimal valid bid is 1 one, which is higher by digit. In my hand, I have one '1', so bidding 1 one is safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 2s. Looking at my hand (81962284), I have two '2's. Since I alone have at least two '2's, the bid of 1 2s is definitely valid, and a higher bid is safe. The next minimum valid bid would be 2 2s, which is truthful based on my hand alone. Alternatively, I could bid 1 3s to increase the digit, but since I don't have any '3's, it's riskier. Therefore, the best strategic move is to raise to 2 2s, which is both valid and conservative.
