--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (23099524), I see that I have two 2s and two 9s. Bidding 2 9s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit and I have multiple occurrences of it.

Player 0 bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s, making it less likely there are 2 or more 9s across both hands. Since 2 9s is already a low bid, it's plausible but challenging here is reasonable due to the absence of 9s in my hand. The probability that Player 0 has both 9s is low, so I will challenge.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor)'s bid of 2 9s.
