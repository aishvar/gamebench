Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, the digit '2' appears twice, and '5' appears twice as well. Digits '1', '3', '6', and '9' each appear once. To start conservatively, it's strategic to bid on a digit I hold multiple times. Therefore, I will open with '2 twos', which is a reasonable and safe opening bid based on my hand, expecting there could be at least 3 or more in total but starting low.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. It's likely that Player 0 is bluffing or has only one 2. I will bid higher to pressure them and potentially force a challenge if they are bluffing. Bidding '3 2s' is a reasonable increase, as it's not excessively high but forces Player 0 to either raise again or call my bluff. I'm choosing to bid 3 2s as it's a safe increase and tests the waters.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 twos. Looking at my hand (52316952), I have two '2's. Since the total digits are 16, for the bid of 3 twos to be valid, the opponent only needs to have at least one '2'. This is quite plausible. Therefore, challenging now is risky. A safe strategic move is to increase the bid slightly. I could either increase the quantity to 4 twos or bid at least 3 threes. Since I don't have any '3's, bidding on '3's is risky. However, I do have two '5's, so bidding 3 fives is reasonable because my hand alone contains two, and the opponent likely has at least one. This keeps pressure on the opponent with a plausible bid.

Player 0 bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Player 0 bid 2 2s, then Player 1 bid 3 2s, and then Player 0 upped it to 3 5s. This suggests Player 0 might have a few 5s. However, the jump from 2s to 5s is significant. I will bid 'BID: Q D' where Q is 4 and D is 5s. This is a valid bid as it's higher than 3 5s, and I'm trying to test the waters without going too high. It's plausible that Player 0 is bluffing, and I want to see if they'll continue to raise.

Player 1 bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 fives. Looking at my hand (52316952), I have two 5s. Therefore, for the current bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least two 5s as well. While it's possible the opponent has two or more 5s, it's statistically less likely given the distribution of digits. Bidding higher would require assuming an even greater number of 5s across both hands, which is increasingly improbable. Therefore, the best strategic move is to challenge the current bid.
