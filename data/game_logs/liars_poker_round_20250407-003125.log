Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make the first bid. I have two 7s in my hand, which gives me confidence to start with a reasonable bid. I will bid 2 7s, as it is a valid starting point that reflects my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s, which is plausible given that there are two players and each has 8 digits. Since I only have one 7, the total count of 7s could indeed be 2 or more if the other player has at least one 7. However, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity to 3, assuming the other player might have at least one 7. Bidding 3 7s is a reasonable move based on my hand and the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and the current bid is already at 3 7s. Since I can only make a higher bid, I should bid at least 4 7s to reflect the possibility of having more 7s in total. This is a reasonable increase based on my hand and the current situation.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s, which means there must be at least three more 7s in Player 0's hand. Given that Player 0 has already increased the bid twice on 7s, it's likely they have multiple 7s. However, I can still make a higher bid by increasing the quantity to 5 7s, which is a reasonable move based on the possibility of Player 0 having at least three 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 7s. Since I know there are at least 6 7s in total (my 2 plus the previous bids), I can confidently bid 6 7s. This is a valid higher bid than the current one.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 7S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 6 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 6 7s, and the bidding history shows a steady increase in the quantity of 7s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and the maximum possible 7s is 2 (since I have one and the opponent could have one), bidding 7 7s is impossible. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
