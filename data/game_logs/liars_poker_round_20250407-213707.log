--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. A good opening bid typically targets a digit that appears multiple times in my hand to reduce risk. In my hand, the digits are 6, 2, 3, 9, 7, 5, 7, 0. The digit '7' appears twice, more than any other digit. Therefore, a safe and strategic opening bid is '2 7', indicating there are at least two 7's across both hands, which I know to be true from my own hand alone.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (60781498), I see I have one '7'. The current bid is '2 7s' made by Player 0. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one '7', bidding higher on '7' is risky without knowing Player 0's full hand. However, I can try to bid on a higher digit. I notice I have two '8's and one '9', but no higher quantity of any single digit than 2. A safe bet would be to bid on a higher digit that I have multiple instances of or a digit that could reasonably be high across both players' hands. Given I have two '8's, bidding '3 8s' seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a potentially strong bid.

Player 1 bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 eights. In my hand (6, 2, 3, 9, 7, 5, 7, 0), I have zero 8s. For Player 1's bid of 3 eights to be valid, they must have at least 3 eights themselves, or the total combined must be 3 or more. Since I have none, Player 1 would need all 3 or more in their own hand, which is unlikely given the distribution of digits (each digit appears roughly 1.6 times on average in a random hand of 8 digits). Therefore, the probability of Player 1 having 3 or more 8s is low. It is unlikely that there are 3 eights across both hands, so challenging is the best move.
