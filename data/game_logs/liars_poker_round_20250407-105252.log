--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 7s, one 9, one 8, one 5, and one 2. The most promising digits are 3s and 7s, each appearing twice. Opening conservatively with a bid that reflects at least the number of 3s I hold is a safe start. Therefore, I will bid 2 3s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 37973852, I have no 4s, so the current bid of 2 4s relies entirely on my opponent's hand. It is plausible they have 2 or more 4s, so challenging now is risky. To outbid, I can either bid 2 5s or increase the quantity. I have two 3s, two 7s, and two 9s, but only one 5 and no 4s. Bidding 2 5s is a minimal safe overbid, but since I have two 7s, bidding 3 7s leverages my hand strength and puts pressure on the opponent, making it a solid, reasonable next bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 7s and one 8. The current bid is 3 8s, and since I only have one 8, for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least two 8s. Given the distribution and typical digit spread among 16 digits, three 8s is plausible, but pushing to 4 8s would be risky. Instead, I can safely increase the bid by quantity to 4 of a digit I have multiples of. Since I have two 7s and previously bid 3 7s, moving up to 4 7s is a reasonable and safe incremental bid, leveraging my strong count of 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (37973852), I have exactly two 8s. The current bid is 4 8s, implying there must be at least two more 8s in Player 1's hand. Since the average number of any specific digit across 16 digits is about 1.6, having four or more 8s total is already somewhat aggressive but plausible. However, five or more 8s would be quite unlikely. I cannot bid 4 9s (digit increase) since I have zero 9s in my hand, making that risky. Raising to 5 8s would be very unlikely given I only have two 8s and would require at least three 8s in Player 1's hand, which is improbable. Therefore, the best move is to challenge.
