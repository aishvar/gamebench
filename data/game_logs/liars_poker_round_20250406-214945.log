Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to make a valid opening bid. I have two 1s and one 5 in my hand. A reasonable opening bid could be 2 1s, as it reflects my hand and is a safe starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 4, 8, 9, 8, 3, 9, 7, 2, which contains zero 1s. Since I have none, the entire bid of 2 1s depends on my opponent having at least two 1s in their hand of 8 digits. The probability of that is relatively low, as the expected number of 1s in their hand is less than 1 based on uniform distribution. Therefore, it's a good opportunity to challenge this bid.
