Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand 24363155, the most frequent digits are '5' appearing twice and '3' also appearing twice. A conservative yet reasonable opening bid is 2 of a digit I have multiple times. Choosing '5' as it is a common digit, I will start with a bid of 2 fives.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 fives. Looking at my hand (17842897), I have zero 5s. Since I have none, for the bid to be true, the opponent would need to have both 5s in their hand, which is somewhat unlikely but possible. The probability of the opponent having two or more 5s among their eight cards is not very high, but not negligible. Since the bid is relatively low and plausible, it is risky to challenge now. Instead, I should increase the bid minimally to maintain pressure and gather more information.

Player 1 bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 sixes. In my hand, I have one '6' (the fourth digit). Since I only know my own hand, the minimum total count of sixes across both hands is 1, but it could be more. For the opponent's hand to have at least one six (making the total two sixes) is quite plausible with 8 unknown digits, so challenging now would be risky. A safe strategic move is to increase the bid slightly to maintain pressure and gather more information. I will increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, bidding 2 sevens.

Player 0 bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. Looking at my hand (17842897), I have two 7s, which already meets the bid without considering Player 0's hand. Since the total count of 7s is at least 2, the bid is safe and likely conservative. To maintain pressure and avoid challenging a likely valid bid, I should make a higher bid. The minimal increment would be to bid 2 8s, as I have two 8s in my hand, making this a safe and valid bid that also advances the game strategically.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 24363155. I have zero 8s. The current bid is 2 8s, which means that both 8s would have to be in Player 1's hand. The probability of Player 1 holding exactly two 8s is quite low given 8 digits. Since I have none, and Player 1 likely would not risk bidding 2 8s without at least one 8, but two is still unlikely. Therefore, challenging is the strategic move here as the bid is probably an overstatement.
