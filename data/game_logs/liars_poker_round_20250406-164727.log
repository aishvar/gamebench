Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. In my hand, I have the digits: 7, 1, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 6. Counting digits, I have three 1s and two 0s. A conservative but solid opening bid leverages my three 1s, as it's likely there is at least one more 1 in the opponent's hand, making a total of at least four. However, as an opening bid, starting with 3 1s is reasonable and safe, reflecting my exact count and inviting the opponent to raise or challenge.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. Since I have two 1s in my hand, I can confidently increase the quantity and digit to a higher value. Bidding 4 2s seems reasonable, as it's a moderate increase in quantity and digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 2S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 71090116, I have zero 2s. Since the total digits in play are 16, for the bid of 4 2s to be valid, the opponent must have at least 4 2s. Given that I have none, it is statistically unlikely they hold 4 or more 2s alone, as the expected average per digit is about 1.6. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
