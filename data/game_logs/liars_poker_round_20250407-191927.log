Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand 84033426, the digit '3' appears twice, '4' appears twice, '0' once, '2' once, '6' once, and '8' once. A common opening strategy is to start with a conservative bid on a digit I have multiple times, to maximize the chances the total count is higher. '3' and '4' both appear twice, so bidding 2 of either is reasonable. I'll choose '3' for the opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. It is unlikely that Player 0 has 2 or more 3s, given the limited number of cards each player has. Therefore, a challenge is the most strategically sound move. Bidding higher would be risky as it would require Player 0 to have at least one 3 and me to have some as well, which is improbable given my hand.
