Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, which means my opponent is claiming there are at least 3 nines across both hands. Since I have zero, all three would need to be in their hand, which is possible but somewhat unlikely. Given the low probability and the fact that it's early in bidding, challenging here is a reasonable choice.
