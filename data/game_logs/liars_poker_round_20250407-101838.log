Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 9s, two 5s, one 2, one 4, and one 6. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 of one of the digits I have multiple of, such as 2 7s or 2 9s. I will choose 2 7s to start the game with a safe and informative bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 8s, which makes the current bid of 2 8s somewhat risky for my opponent. However, since the bid is only 2, it's still quite plausible that my opponent holds two 8s or one 8, and I simply have none. Challenging now would be premature. I notice I have two 7s in my hand, and since the previous bid was 2 7s, I can safely increase the quantity to 3 and bid on 7s, leveraging my strong holding.
