Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (82450443), I have: one 8, one 2, one 5, one 4, two 4s, one 3. The most frequent digit in my hand is 4, which appears three times. Since this is the first bid, I should make a strategic choice. I could bid conservatively based just on what I know is in my hand (like '3 4s'), but I can be a bit more aggressive since the other player likely has some 4s as well. I'll bid 4 4s, which means I'm expecting at least one more 4 in my opponent's hand, which is reasonable.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. My hand is 00286763, which contains zero 4s. For the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least four 4s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having four or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is very low (approximately 0.5%). Since I hold none of the bid digit, the likelihood of the current bid being true is extremely small. Therefore, challenging is the statistically strongest move.
