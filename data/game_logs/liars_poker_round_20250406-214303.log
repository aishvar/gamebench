Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 45417956, I notice that I have two 4s and other digits that are singular. Since I have to make a bid that is strictly higher than 'None', I should start with a digit I have at least one of and a quantity that seems reasonable given my hand. Bidding on a digit I have in abundance, like the 4, seems like a good starting point. Given I have two 4s, bidding '2 4s' seems like a safe and reasonable initial bid, considering I don't know what the other player has.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding 3 4s is a valid move, but it doesn't significantly increase the risk for the opponent. Bidding 2 5s is also valid, but I don't have any 5s. Bidding 3 5s or higher would be risky without knowing the opponent's hand. Since I only have one 4, and the opponent could have one or more, challenging seems reasonable. A bid of 2 4s is relatively low, making it a plausible bid.
