Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 9s, two 5s, one 2, and one 3. A safe and strong opening bid is 2 8s, reflecting my own hand and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s. Bidding 3 2s increases the quantity while leveraging my existing pair. While there's uncertainty about the opponent's 2s, the probability they have at least one (making the total â‰¥3) is higher than successfully challenging the current 8s bid, where they likely have at least one 8.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s. The current bid is 3 2s, which I could raise by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 8s, it's plausible there are at least three 8s in total across both hands, making a bid of 3 8s reasonable. This bid is higher than 3 2s because it has the same quantity but a higher digit.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 2s and one 8. The current bid is 3 8s. Bidding 4 2s increases the quantity, leveraging my existing 2s and potential opponent's 2s from previous bid interactions.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 2S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 9, 3, 2, 9, 5, 8, 8, 7. I have only one '2'. The current bid is 4 2s, meaning there must be at least four 2s among all 16 digits. Since I only have one, my opponent would need to have at least three 2s, which is quite unlikely. The probability of having four or more 2s total is low given my hand, so challenging is the best move.
