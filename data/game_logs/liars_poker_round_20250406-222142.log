Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make a valid first bid. I have two 2s, two 3s, one 4, one 5, one 6, and one 8 in my hand. A reasonable starting bid would be 2 2s, as I can back it up with my hand and it establishes a baseline for future bidding.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I notice that the current bid is '2 2s', which is quite low, but I have no 2s in my hand. Instead, I hold two 9s, so I can safely assert that there are at least two 9s in the total. Bidding '2 9s' is a valid move because it is strictly higher than '2 2s' (same quantity but with a higher digit), and it's a bid I can back up with my own hand. This move puts pressure on my opponent without taking an unnecessary risk by challenging a bid that might actually be true.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 9s. Given that I have 8 digits total and there are only 2 9s being claimed, it seems unlikely that there are enough 9s in total. I will challenge this bid.
