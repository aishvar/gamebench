Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s and two 7s, which are my strongest counts. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I will start with 2 5s, reflecting my known digits and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have the hand 24040318, which contains one 5. So, the total count of 5s across both hands is at least 1 (from my hand) plus at least 1 (from the opponent's hand), making it plausible that there are at least 2 5s. However, to continue the game, I need to bid higher. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I see that I have a 4 and an 8, and no other high digits, bidding 2 8s seems like a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (1,5,7,2,4,5,7,6), I have no 8s at all. Since there are 16 digits total, and I hold zero 8s, the opponent would need to have both 8s to make the current bid of 2 8s valid. This is possible but somewhat unlikely. However, bidding 3 of any digit would be risky unless I have strong evidence. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s and two 7s. Since the previous bid started with 2 5s, and the opponent increased to 2 8s, bidding 3 5s is a safe, minimal increase leveraging my pair of 5s. This is a reasonable and safe way to escalate the bid without overcommitting.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. My hand is 24040318, which contains two 3s and no 5s. I can see that there's a possibility of having more 3s across both hands. I can bid higher than 3 5s by either increasing the quantity or bidding the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I have two 3s, I can infer that there might be more 3s. Bidding 3 8s is a good option as it increases the digit. However, considering my hand and the fact that the opponent has already bid on 5s, I should consider a more strategic move. Bidding 4 3s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and is based on the digit I have in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 1, 5, 7, 2, 4, 5, 7, 6. I have zero 3s, so the current bid of 4 3s relies entirely on Player 1 holding at least 4 of them, which is highly improbable given the distribution of digits. Since I have none, the chance that there are 4 or more 3s total is quite low, making this a good opportunity to challenge.
