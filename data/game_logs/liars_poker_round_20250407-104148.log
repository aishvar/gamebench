Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must open with an initial bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 5, one 7, two 9s, one 2, one 4, and two 6s. The strongest digits to bid on are 6s or 9s, each appearing twice in my hand. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 6s, reflecting my own hand and leaving room for future raises.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7. The current bid is 2 7s, meaning at least two 7s across both hands. Since I hold one, it's plausible the opponent has at least one, making the bid reasonable. To increase the bid, the minimal legal move is either 2 8s or 3 0s (any digit). Given that I also hold one 9 and two 6s, I can consider bidding 3 6s, leveraging my two 6s and hoping the opponent has at least one. This is a safer incremental bid based on my hand's strength.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7. The current bid is 3 7s, so the opponent claims there are at least three 7s total. Since I only have one, the opponent would need at least two 7s in their hand for the bid to be valid. Given that each player has eight digits, the chance of the opponent holding two or more 7s is moderate but not guaranteed. Instead of challenging now, I can safely increase the bid by raising the digit while keeping the quantity, which is a conservative and strategic move. I also have two 9s, so bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid that leverages my hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 1 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 1 (Naive 50/50)
Player 1 (Naive) chose to BID: 4 0s
Player 1 (Naive 50/50) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains one 0. For the current bid of 4 0s to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least three 0s, which is unlikely given the uniform distribution of digits. There are only 16 digits total, so having 4 of a specific digit is already on the higher side of probability. Since I only have one 0, the bid of 4 0s is suspicious and likely an overbid by the opponent. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
