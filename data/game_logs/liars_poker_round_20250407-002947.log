Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (50748899), I see that I have two 8s. Bidding 2 8s is a safe starting point, as it's likely there are at least two 8s in total across both players' hands.
