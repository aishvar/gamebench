Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 04925936. I can count that I have two 0s, one 2, one 3, two 5s, one 6, and one 9. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the most frequent digit in my hand or a digit I have a good count of. I have two 0s and two 5s, which are the highest counts. Bidding on 0 or 5 seems reasonable. I'll start with bidding on a digit that is relatively high or has a good count. Bidding 2 0s seems like a safe and reasonable starting point.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. The total count of 1s across both hands must be at least 2 (one from my hand and potentially one from the other player's hand), so the bid of 2 1s is plausible. However, I have two 3s and two other relatively high digits. I can increase the bid by bidding on a higher digit or increasing the quantity. Bidding 3 0s or 2 3s would be reasonable. I choose to bid 2 3s as it is a higher digit and I have two 3s in my hand, making it more likely that the total count is higher.
