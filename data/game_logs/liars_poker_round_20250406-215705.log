Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have the digits 9, 3, 6, 0, 7, 4, 1, and 8 in my hand, which gives me a strong set of digits. Since there have been no bids yet, I can start by making a reasonable bid. I will bid 1 9s, which is a valid starting bid considering I have a 9 in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s. I have one 8, two 2s, two 4s, one 1, one 0, and one 3. Since the current bid is only 1 9s, and I don't have any 9s, I can bid a slightly higher amount to try to push the other player to challenge or make a riskier bid. I will bid 2 0s, since I have one 0 in my hand and it's a small increment.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 0s. Since I have a 0, I can increase the bid to 3 0s, which is a valid higher bid. This is a reasonable move as it considers my hand and the current bid.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Since the bid is relatively low, and I don't have a strong read on how many 0s my opponent might have, I'll make a slightly higher bid. I will bid 3 1s to increase the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 1S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand and the current bid is 3 1s. Since I can confirm that there are at least 2 1s from my hand, I can increase the bid to 4 1s, which is a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. I could bid higher, but it's risky. Bidding 5 1s seems like a reasonable increase, but I'll play it safe and bid a slightly higher digit instead. I'll bid 4 2s, since I have two 2s in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 2S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 1 and one 8 in my hand, which means the digit 2 is less likely to have a high count across both hands. The current bid is 4 2s, which seems high given that I can only see my hand. Therefore, I should challenge this bid.
