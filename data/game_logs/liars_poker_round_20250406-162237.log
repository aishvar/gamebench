Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 01964373. I count 3 (one 0, one 3, one 9) out of 8 digits that are 3 or higher. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but not too low. Bidding 2 3s seems like a safe initial bid as it reflects a moderate count and is a relatively low digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 85971860, I have a total of 4 threes (not directly relevant but useful for context), and other digits in my hand could potentially match or exceed the current bid quantity or digit. I have one 3 in my hand, so I can confidently say there are at least 2 threes in total (including Player 0's hand). However, to make a valid higher bid, I should consider increasing either the quantity or the digit. The current bid is quite low, so I should consider what digits I have and what would be a reasonable increase. I have no 3s but have multiple higher digits. A safe increase would be to bid higher on the digit or the quantity. I have 2 sixes which could be useful. A bid of 3 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (0, 1, 9, 6, 4, 3, 7, 3), so I know there are at least two 6s. The total count of 6s must be at least 2 (my 6s) plus one 6 from Player 1's hand (since they bid 3 6s), making it at least 3. I can either match the quantity and increase the digit or increase the quantity. Increasing the quantity to 4 with the same digit (6) seems reasonable because I know I have two 6s and it's likely Player 1 has at least one more, making 4 6s a believable bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I need to analyze my hand and the bid history. My hand contains the digits: 8, 5, 9, 7, 1, 8, 6, 0. I have one 6 in my hand. The bid history shows that Player 0 bid 2 3s and then 4 6s. Given that I have one 6 and Player 0 has already bid 4 6s, I should consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since I only have one 6, bidding a higher quantity than 4 for 6s or any other digit seems risky without more information. However, I can try to bid higher with a different digit or challenge if I think the bid is unlikely.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity and bid a higher digit. Since I don't have many 7s, increasing the quantity to 6 might be too high unless my opponent has a lot of 7s. However, bidding 5 8s is a safe move as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit. I will bid 5 8s.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 8, 5, 7, 1, 6, 0, 9, and 4. I have one 8, so the total count of 8s could be between 1 and 16. Given that the previous bid was 5 8s, I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is the best option. Since I have one 8 and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I should consider if there's a high likelihood that there are more than 5 8s in total. If not, I should try to make a higher bid that is still plausible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I have the digits 01964373, which means I have no 9s. The total count of 9s across both hands must be at least 6 (the bid quantity) since Player 1 made the bid. This implies Player 1 has at least six 9s. Given that the maximum number of 9s a player can have is 8, and it's highly unlikely both players have exactly 6 or more 9s (since I have none), the bid seems aggressive but not impossible. However, I can bid higher. I can either increase the quantity or change the digit to a higher one. Since I don't have any 9s, and increasing the quantity of 9s to 7 would be a significant claim, I'll consider bidding 7 9s. Alternatively, I can change the digit to a higher one, but since 9 is the highest digit, I can only increase the quantity. I'll bid 7 9s as it seems like a reasonable next step, challenging but not entirely unbelievable given the current state of the game.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 7 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. Given that I have 2 9s in my hand, I know that there are at least 2 nines in total. However, I do not have enough information about Player 0's hand to accurately assess the total count of 9s. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I must consider the possibility of making a bid that is higher than 7 9s. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. I can try to bid higher with a different digit. I have 3 6s and 3 8s and 2 9s and 1 7 in my hand, so bidding 8 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and digit compared to previous bids and seems plausible given the hands I could have.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 8 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. My hand contains two 6s, so I know there are at least two 6s. The total number of digits in play is 16, so it's possible that there are 8 6s. However, the bid history suggests that Player 1 has been trying to outmaneuver me. The bid of 8 6s is a significant increase from the previous bid of 7 9s. I need to assess whether it's likely that Player 1 has additional 6s beyond what I can see. Given that I have two 6s and there are 14 other digits, it's not impossible that there are 6 more 6s out there. However, bidding higher seems challenging. I can either challenge or bid higher. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity to 9 or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Increasing the digit to 7 or higher isn't an option since I'm already at 6s, and going to a higher digit without a quantity increase isn't valid. So, I can bid 9 0s or higher. Before doing that, I should consider if challenging is a better option. Challenging seems risky given that there are potentially 6 more 6s out there. I'll analyze my hand again: I have 01964373, which has two 3s and two other numbers that could potentially be 6s if the other player has a lot of 6s. Given the information, bidding 9 0s is a safer bet as it increases the quantity and is a relatively conservative bid considering the total count of digits.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 9 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 0s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that this bid is valid. Given that my hand contains the digits 8, 5, 9, 7, 1, 8, 6, 0, I can see that there are at least two 0s (from my hand) and I know Player 0 has 8 secret digits. The bid of 9 0s seems high but not impossible. However, I don't have enough information about Player 0's hand to accurately determine the likelihood of there being 9 or more 0s in total. My goal is to make a bid that is higher than 9 0s, either in quantity or digit. Since I have two 6s and the last bid was 8 6s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I will bid 10 1s because I have one 1 and it seems like a reasonable increase in quantity while choosing a lower digit that could potentially be more common.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 10 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 1s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand is 01964373. I count 2 ones in my hand, so there are 6 ones left in the opponent's hand. It's possible they have at most 6 ones, making 8 ones in total, which is less than the bid of 10. However, they might have more, and I should consider the bidding history and the fact that they might be bluffing or have a strong hand. Bidding 10 2s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit. However, considering the quantity is already high (10), and my hand has no 2s, I should be cautious. I will challenge the bid as it seems too high to be true given the total count of ones can't exceed 8 if I have 2 ones and they have at most 6.
