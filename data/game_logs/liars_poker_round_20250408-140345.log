Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to start the bidding. In my hand, I have two 2s, one 0, one 4, one 6, one 7, one 8, and one 8. A reasonable opening bid would be 2 8s, as I hold two 8s myself and it is likely there are more 8s in the other player's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The opponent has bid '2 8s', which means they believe there are at least 2 eights in total between both our hands. Looking at my own hand (62048453), I have zero 8s. Since there are only 8 digits in each player's hand, the maximum possible number of 8s is 8 (if all of the opponent's digits were 8s). Given that I have zero 8s in my hand, the opponent must have at least 2 eights in their hand for their bid to be valid. This is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's a fairly low and reasonable opening bid, so the risk isn't worth it. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 4 and two 5s. I could bid '2 9s', but I don't have any 9s. A safer bid would be '3 5s' since I already have two 5s in my hand, meaning I only need one more 5 from the opponent's hand for this to be true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 5s. Given that I don't have any 5s, it is uncertain how many 5s Player 1 might have, but I can reasonably bid 4 8s as I already hold two 8s myself. This increases the quantity and changes the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have 8 digits in my hand: 62048453. Looking at my hand, I have one 8. The current bid is '4 8s', meaning Player 0 is claiming there are at least 4 eights total between our hands. Since I have 1 eight, that would mean Player 0 would need to have at least 3 eights in their hand. While possible, having 3 of the same digit in an 8-digit random hand is somewhat unlikely. However, Player 0 started by bidding '2 8s' and then raised to '4 8s' after I bid '3 5s', suggesting they might actually have multiple 8s. Given that I have one 8 and they seem confident about 8s, I think it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I have two 5s in my hand, so I could bid '5 5s', but that's risky. I also have one 4 and one 6, so I could bid '4 9s' to go higher. Since I don't have any 9s, this is risky but forces the opponent to either bid very high or challenge me.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. Looking at my hand, I have no 9s, and the maximum possible quantity of 9s across both players is 16. However, based on the bidding history and my hand, it's unlikely there are 4 or more 9s total. Player 1 raised from 4 8s to 4 9s, which suggests they might be bluffing or have some 9s but not enough to confidently reach 4. Given my lack of 9s and the improbability of 4 9s overall, I should challenge this bid.
