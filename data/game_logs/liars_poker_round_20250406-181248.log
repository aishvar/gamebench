Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. Since 0 is a low digit and the quantity is also low, I should make a higher bid to increase both quantity and digit. Considering my hand has 3 7s, 6 6s, and 8 8s, I can safely bid on a high digit with a moderate quantity.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, which is a relatively high quantity. However, I have a 9 in my hand, so I should increase the quantity and digit to make a valid higher bid. I'll choose a digit that is higher than 9, but not too high, to make a reasonable bid. I'll bid 5 9s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to make a valid higher bid than 6 0s. Given my hand, I notice I have two 8s. Since the previous highest bid was 4 8s, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity or digit. I'll make a higher bid by increasing the digit, as I don't have any 9s in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 6 0s, which is quite low. I can increase the digit to 8, which I have in my hand, and also increase the quantity to 7 since 6 is not a strong enough bid.
