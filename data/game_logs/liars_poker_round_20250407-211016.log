Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. I will analyze my hand to determine the best possible bid. My hand is 54783995. I have a high count of the digit 9, with 3 occurrences, and also a high count of the digit 5 and 8, with 2 occurrences each, and the digits 4, 7, and 3 with 1 occurrence each. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and considering my hand, I will make a bid that is likely to be valid but also strategic, taking into account the potential distribution of digits in the other player's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 nines. Looking at my hand (86501122), I have zero 9s. Since I hold none, all 3 nines must be in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. The probability that Player 0 has exactly 3 or more 9s in their 8-digit hand is quite low, as the expected number of 9s per player is roughly 0.8 (8 digits Ã— 1/10 chance per digit). Therefore, it's unlikely Player 0 has 3 or more 9s, making their bid suspiciously high. A higher bid on 9s or any other digit is unreasonable given my hand, so the best move is to challenge.
