Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand (digits: 3,7,1,2,6,9,3,1). Since the current bid is only 1 zero, it is quite plausible that my opponent has at least one zero in their hand of 8 digits. Challenging now is risky. The minimal safe move is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have two 1s, so bidding 1 1s is guaranteed to be true. It is a safe incremental bid.
