--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand has two 5s. The opponent likely has at least one 5 (57% chance), making the total at least 3. Starting with a moderate bid on a mid-digit (5) balances risk and sets a foundation for future bids.

--- Turn: Player 1 (quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 fives. Looking at my hand (17807179), I have zero 5s. Since I have none, all three 5s would need to be in Player 0's hand. This is statistically unlikely, as the expected count of any digit in 8 digits is less than 1, and having 3 of the same digit is rare. Therefore, it's improbable there are 3 fives total, making this bid suspicious. Challenging is the best move.
