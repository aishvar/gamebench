Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 40199827, I have one 0, two 9s, one 8, one 7, one 4, one 2, and one 1. The most frequent digit in my hand is 9 (appearing twice). Since this is the first bid and I want to start conservatively while using information I'm certain about, I'll bid three 9s. This accounts for my two 9s and assumes the opponent has at least one 9, which is reasonable given they have 8 digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 15044863, I have zero 9s. Since there are 16 digits total and I have none, the opponent would need at least 3 9s alone to make their bid valid. That is quite unlikely. Statistically, expecting 3 or more 9s solely in their hand is a risky assumption. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
