Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. I have one 9 in my hand (98253140). The total number of digits is 16. Statistically, the expected number of any digit is 1.6. Bidding '2 9s' is a reasonable opening bid. It requires only one 9 from the opponent's 8 digits, which is statistically likely. It's a safe but slightly assertive opening compared to bidding '1 0s'.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 62364738, I have no 9s. Since the current bid is only 2 9s, it's quite plausible that my opponent has two or even more 9s in their hand. Challenging now would be risky. Instead, I should make a safe incremental bid. I have two 6s, so bidding 3 6s increases the quantity and switches to a digit I hold multiple of, making the bid plausible and putting pressure back on the opponent.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 98253140. I have zero 6s. The current bid is '3 6s' made by Player 1. For this bid to be true, Player 1 must have at least three 6s in their 8-digit hand, as I have none. While possible, having 3 or more of a specific digit out of 8 is statistically less likely than having 0, 1, or 2. The bid quantity (3) is still relatively low, but given my complete lack of the bid digit, challenging seems like a strong strategic move. Player 1 might be bluffing or trying to move the bid away from my previous bid of '2 9s'. Bidding higher, like '3 7s', '3 8s', or '3 9s', is possible as I have one 8 and one 9, but it feels riskier than challenging a bid I know requires my opponent to hold all the necessary digits.
