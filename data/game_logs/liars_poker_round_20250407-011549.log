Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 95367510. I have zero 2s. The current bid is '2 2s', meaning the opponent claims there are at least two 2s across both hands (16 digits total). For this bid to be true, the opponent must have at least two 2s in their 8-digit hand, as I have none. The probability of an opponent having two or more 2s in 8 digits is relatively low (approximately 18.7%). Conversely, the probability that the opponent has zero or one 2 (meaning the total count is less than 2) is high (approximately 81.3%). Therefore, challenging the bid has a high likelihood of success.
