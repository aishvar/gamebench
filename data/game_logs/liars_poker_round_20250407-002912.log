Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 1 0s, which is the minimum possible bid. Since I have at least one 0, I can safely bid higher. Bidding 2 0s is a reasonable increase, as it is both a higher quantity and based on the digit I have in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 3s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have two 3s, increasing the quantity to 4 3s is not possible without risking a challenge. However, I can bid 4 of a higher digit. I have three 2s, so bidding 4 2s is not an option as it's lower than the current bid in terms of digit. Instead, I notice I have two 6s, which allows me to bid 4 6s, increasing both the quantity and the digit.
