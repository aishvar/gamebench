Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand (43582205), I have: one 4, one 3, one 5, one 8, one 2 twice, and one 0 twice. Since I have two 2s and two 0s in my hand, these are good candidates for my bid. The other player likely has some of these digits as well. I'll start with a conservative bid of 3 2s, suggesting there's at least one more 2 in the opponent's hand (which is reasonable).

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand (30399576) contains no 2s, so I have 0 2s. The current bid of 3 2s requires that all three 2s come solely from the opponent's 8 digits, which is highly improbable (roughly a 4% chance). Given these odds, it is a strong move to challenge the bid.
