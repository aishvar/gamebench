Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. The digit '5' appears once in my hand. Assuming the opponent also has a similar distribution, bidding '5' for 2 occurrences is a reasonable starting point. This bid is low enough to be likely true but high enough to start the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 twos. Looking at my hand (06158171), I have zero 2s. Since I have no 2s, the entire count of 2s depends solely on Player 0's hand. For their bid of 5 twos to be valid, they would need to have all 5 or more 2s themselves, which is statistically very unlikely given only 8 digits. Typically, seeing more than 3-4 of the same digit in a single hand is rare. Therefore, it's improbable there are 5 or more 2s in total. Hence, challenging is the better move.
