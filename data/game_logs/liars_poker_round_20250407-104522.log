Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible. Since I must raise, the minimal higher bid would be 1 1s. Alternatively, I could bid 2 of any digit where I have strong representation. I have three 4s, so bidding 2 4s is a safe and stronger move that leverages my hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 4s and no 5s. The current bid is 2 5s, which is plausible, but since I hold no 5s, I have no direct evidence to challenge it now. A safe strategic move is to increase the bid based on my strong count of 4s, which also pressures the opponent. I will bid 3 4s, which is strictly higher (higher quantity) than the current bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 5s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 4s and no 5s. The current bid is 3 5s, which requires at least three 5s in total. Since I have zero 5s, all three must be in Player 0's hand, which is unlikely as the expected count per digit in 8 digits is less than one. It is improbable Player 0 holds all three 5s, so I should challenge the bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (Naive 50/50) bid of 3 5s.
