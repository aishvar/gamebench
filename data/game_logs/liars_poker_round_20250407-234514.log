Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 2s, two 9s, and one each of 1, 5, 0, 3. Bidding 2 2s is a safe and reasonable starting point, as it's likely there are at least two 2s in total across both players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 2s in my hand. The current bid is 2 2s, meaning the opponent must have all 2s themselves. With 8 digits, the probability they have exactly 2+ 2s is relatively low (~18.7% assuming uniform distribution). Since I have none, challenging now has a high likelihood of success as the total count is likely below 2.
