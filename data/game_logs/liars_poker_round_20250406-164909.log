Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a good mix of digits in my hand, including a 9. The current bid is None, so I should start with a reasonable bid. I notice I have two 6s, so I'll start with a bid of 3 6s, increasing the quantity and digit to make it more challenging.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 7, 6, 0, 8, 0, 5, 5, 9. I have one 6, which supports the current bid of 3 6s only if the opponent has at least two 6s. This is plausible but not certain. To raise, I can consider other digits I have multiples of. I have two 0s and two 5s, but the current bid is 3 6s, so any bid of 3 7s, 3 8s, or 3 9s would be a minimal raise. Since I have a 7, 8, and 9 each once, bidding 3 7s, 3 8s, or 3 9s is risky. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 4 and pick a digit I have at least some confidence in. With two 0s, bidding 4 0s requires only two more 0s in the opponent's hand, which is plausible. Therefore, the safest higher bid is 4 0s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have 2 1s and 1 0 in my hand. I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity or digit. Bidding 5 1s seems reasonable as it is a higher quantity and digit than the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 1S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '76080559', I have zero 1s. Since there are 16 digits total and I hold none, all 5 claimed 1s would have to be in Player 0's hand, which is very unlikely. The average count of any digit is roughly 1.6 per hand, so 5 is a high estimate. Therefore, I believe the bid of 5 1s is an overbid and I should challenge.
