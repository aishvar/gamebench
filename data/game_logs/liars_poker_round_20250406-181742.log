Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 0 in my hand (8 1 4 4 5 4 9 7), so the total count of 0s across both hands is at least 1. I can either challenge or bid higher. Since the bid is not obviously false and I don't have a strong hand for a higher digit, I'll consider bidding higher on 0s or a higher digit. Bidding 1 1s is a reasonable next step as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 2s. I have one 2 in my hand (from 81445497). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I see one 2, bidding 2 2s is a reasonable move as it increases the quantity. However, I should also consider the likelihood of the other player having a 2. Given that the other player has 8 digits and I have one 2, it's plausible they have at least one 2 as well, making 2 2s a believable bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I see one 3 in my hand, it's likely there's at least one more 3 in the other player's hand, making the total count of 3s at least 2. I will bid 2 4s, increasing the digit to make a higher bid.
