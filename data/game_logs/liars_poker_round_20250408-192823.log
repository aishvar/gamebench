Player 0 Reasoning: I have two '2's in my hand, which guarantees that there are at least two 2s among the 16 digits. Since there is no current bid, starting with BID: 2 2s is a safe and conservative opening move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (47653092), I don't have any 2s. The current bid is 2 2s, which means the opponent is claiming there are at least 2 twos between our hands. Since I have zero 2s, this means all of those claimed 2s would have to be in the opponent's hand. With 8 digits in their hand, it's certainly possible they have 2 or more 2s. I could challenge, but it's a very reasonable opening bid that could easily be true. Instead, I'll make a higher bid based on what I know is in my hand. I have one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 7, one 9, one 0, and one 2. I could bid on any of these, but I'll choose 2 3s since I have one 3 and only need the opponent to have one more for this to be true. This is a safe incremental raise that maintains the same quantity but increases the digit from 2 to 3.

Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (20188325), I have two 8s. The current bid is 2 3s, and I can raise it by bidding the same quantity but a higher digit. Since I hold two 8s, bidding '2 8s' is safe because if challenged, I already have the required two 8s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. The current bid is '2 8s'. Looking at my hand (47653092), I have one 8 in my possession. Since there are only two players with 8 digits each, the maximum possible count of any digit is 16. The opponent has bid that there are at least 2 8s total between our hands. Since I already have 1 eight, this bid is quite reasonable and likely to be true - the opponent would only need to have 1 or more eights themselves. I should make a higher bid rather than challenging. I could either increase the quantity to 3 or keep the quantity at 2 but increase the digit to 9. Looking at my hand, I have one 9, so bidding '2 9s' seems reasonable - I only need the opponent to have at least one 9 as well. This is a safer bid than increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I notice that my hand (20188325) contains no 9s, so I have no support for the current bid of '2 9s'. Since there are only 8 unknown digits in the opponent's hand, the probability that they hold at least two 9s is quite low (roughly around 18%). Bidding higher would force me to risk a bid (e.g., '3 2s' or '3 8s') that I only partially back up with my hand. Given these factors, challenging the bid seems like the most prudent move.
