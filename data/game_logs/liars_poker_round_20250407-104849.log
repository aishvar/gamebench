Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game, and I hold the digits 8, 7, 2, 9, 2, 9, 0, 5. The most frequent digits in my hand are two 2s and two 9s. Since there are 16 digits total, it's statistically likely that there are at least three of a common digit like 2 or 9 across both hands. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I'll bid 3 2s, leveraging my own pair of 2s and the likelihood that the opponent has at least one more.
