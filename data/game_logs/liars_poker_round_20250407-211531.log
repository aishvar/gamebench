Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. I will analyze my hand to decide on a reasonable starting bid. My hand is 01138972. The count of each digit in my hand is: 0-1, 1-2, 2-1, 3-1, 7-1, 8-1, 9-1. I will bid on the digit with the highest count. The digit '1' appears 2 times in my hand. I will bid on the count of '1' with a quantity of 2, as it's a conservative start and reflects the count in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. My hand is 01138972, which contains two '1's, one '2', one '7', one '8', one '9', and one '3'. I can start by bidding on a digit that I have. Since I have two '1's and two is a relatively conservative count considering there are 16 digits in total across both players, I will bid on the count of '1'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 3/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids yet. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 01138972, which contains two '1's, one '2', one '7', one '8', one '9', and two other digits ('0' and '3'). A reasonable first bid should be based on my hand and a guess about the opponent's hand. I have 2 '1's and 2 'other digits that could potentially be '1's or other digits in the opponent's hand, making a total possible count of '1's to be around 4 or more if we consider both hands. Thus, bidding on '1' with a count slightly above what I see in my hand is reasonable.
