Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the opening bid, so I want to start conservatively but with a reasonable chance of success. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 7, two 3s, one 2, one 8, one 4, and one 9. The most frequent digits in my hand are two 3s. Since there are 16 digits total, bidding 2 3s is safe based on my hand alone, but it's better to start with a minimal bid to avoid overcommitting early. I'll open with 2 3s, reflecting my hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 0, 7, 9, 7, 3, 2, 8, 4. I see only one 4 in my hand. Since the current bid is 2 4s, it's quite reasonable, but I cannot challenge yet as it's not suspicious enough. To continue, I need to make a higher bid. I observe two 7s in my hand, so a safe and strategic move is to bid 3 7s, which increases the quantity and is likely plausible given my hand and the unknowns in the opponent's hand.
