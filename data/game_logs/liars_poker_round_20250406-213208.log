--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a reasonable bid. Bidding 4 6s is a logical step as it accounts for the possibility of the other player having one more 6.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (28957757), I have zero 6s. Since there are 16 digits in total and I have none, the opponent would need to be holding all 4 or more 6s alone for the bid to be valid, which is unlikely. The probability of the opponent having 4 or more 6s out of 8 digits is quite low. Therefore, challenging is a reasonable strategy here.
