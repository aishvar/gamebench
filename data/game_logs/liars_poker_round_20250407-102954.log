Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is only 1 zero, it's quite likely true or even conservative. Therefore, challenging now is unwise. To make a higher bid, I can increase either the quantity or the digit. I have three 4s in my hand, so bidding 3 4s is a safe and stronger bid, increasing both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 4s and one 5. The current bid is 3 5s. Since I only have one 5, Player 0 would need to have at least two 5s to make the bid valid. Given that, it's plausible but not guaranteed. However, I have two 4s, so a bid of 4 4s requires only two more 4s in Player 0's hand, which is reasonable. Therefore, I will increase the quantity and revert to a digit I have more of, making a safer, higher bid of 4 4s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 5s and three 4s. The current bid is 4 5s. Since I hold two 5s, the opponent would need at least two more 5s for the bid to be valid. The probability that the opponent has two or more 5s in their 8 cards is moderate but not guaranteed. However, making a higher bid with 4 6s is risky because I only have one 6. A safer incremental bid is 4 6s, which raises the digit while keeping the quantity, leveraging my single 6. This strategic move pressures the opponent without overcommitting.
