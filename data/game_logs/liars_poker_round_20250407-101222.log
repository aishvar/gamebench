Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 0s, one 2, one 3, one 5, and one 9. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be 2 8s, as I already hold two 8s myself, making this bid true regardless of the opponent's hand. This also puts some pressure on the opponent early.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9 and two 8s. The current bid is 2 9s, which is plausible since I have one 9 myself, so the opponent could reasonably have at least one more. Challenging now would be risky. To increase the bid, the minimal increment is either 3 0s or 3 9s. I have two 0s, so bidding 3 0s is safer than bidding 3 9s, given my hand composition. Therefore, I will bid 3 0s.
