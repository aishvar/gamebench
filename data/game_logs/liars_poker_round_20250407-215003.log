Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: For my opening bid, I should analyze my hand and make a strategic first move. In my hand, I have two 4s, which is a good starting point. Since this is the first bid, I want to make a moderate bid that gives me room to maneuver later. Bidding 3 fours is reasonable because I already have 2 fours, and it's likely there could be at least one more four in the opponent's hand. This is a conservative opening that doesn't reveal too much information while still being defensible.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. Looking at my hand (70589322), I have zero 4s. Since I have none, the entire count of 4s depends on Player 0's hand. For the bid to be valid, Player 0 would need all 3 or more 4s, which is unlikely given typical digit distribution. The probability that one player holds 3 or more of a single digit is low with 8 digits. Therefore, it's a good strategic move to challenge now rather than risk raising a potentially false bid.
