Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, ensuring that there are at least two 6s in play regardless of the opponent's digits. With no bid yet, starting safely by bidding on my strongest digit minimizes riskâ€”even if the opponent has no 6s, my bid of 2 6s is indisputable.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which means there are at least 2 6s accounted for. Since the current bid is 2 6s, I can either raise the quantity or the digit. I can bid 3 6s, which is a reasonable increase based on my hand's contribution and maintains the same digit. This is a valid higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which bolsters the bid on 6s. Elevating the current bid from 3 6s to 4 6s is a logical move since I already contribute half of that count. Although it requires the opponent to hold at least 2 additional 6s from their 8 unknown digits (roughly an 18.7% chance), it leverages my known strength rather than shifting to a digit where I have no cards. This bid forces my opponent into a difficult position, making it the best strategic action.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 6s. Since I can confirm that there are at least 6 total 6s possible (considering my hand and the previous bids), I can make a valid higher bid. I will bid 5 6s, which is a valid increase in quantity while maintaining the same digit.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, so for the current bid of 5 6s to be true, the opponent must have at least three 6s in their eight-digit hand, which is very unlikely (roughly a 3.8% chance if digits are random). Any higher bid (like 5 7s or 6 6s) would require even less probable outcomes given my hand. Thus, it is strategically best to challenge the bid.
