Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable bid. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a safe starting point, as it's likely there are at least three 5s in total between both players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, so Player 0 must have at least 3. Challenging would likely result in a loss. Bidding 4 5s is risky but possible if Player 0 has more than 3.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have two 5s in my hand. It's unlikely that the other player has more than two 5s, so challenging seems risky. However, I have one 6, one 8, and one 9. Bidding 5 6s is a reasonable move, increasing both the quantity and the digit.
