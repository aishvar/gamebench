Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning this is the first bid. My hand contains three 0s, two 3s, one 1, one 7, and one 5. A safe, but not overly revealing, opening bid would be to bid 3 of the digit 3. This is a reasonable number given my hand, and doesn't commit me to a large number of that digit if my opponent has few or none.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 52816768. I have zero 3s. The current bid is '3 3s', meaning the bidder claims there are at least three 3s across all 16 digits (my 8 and their 8). Since I hold no 3s, the opponent must hold at least three 3s in their 8-digit hand for the bid to be true. The probability of having 3 or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is statistically low (P(X>=3) for Binomial(8, 0.1) is approx 3.8%). Given this low probability, challenging the bid is the most statistically advantageous move.
