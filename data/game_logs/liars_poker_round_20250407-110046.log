Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 3s, two 4s, one 2, one 5, and one 7. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 3s, as I have two 3s myself, and it's likely there may be more across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. Bidding higher than 2 3s is necessary. I have two 5s, so bidding 3 5s is a reasonable option, increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 2 4s, 2 6s, 2 8s, 2 9s, or 2 0s. However, 3 5s seems like the most natural and plausible bid given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 3, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 1, 7. I only have one 5, so for the current bid of 3 5s to be valid, the opponent would need at least two 5s. This is possible but not strongly likely. However, I have two 3s, which suggests that making a higher bid on 3s is safer. Since the current bid is 3 5s, I can increase the quantity and bid 4 3s, which is a higher bid and supported by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 3s is necessary. I have two 5s, two 9s, one 0, one 6, and one 8. Bidding 5 5s is a reasonable option, as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 4 6s or 4 8s or 4 9s. However, 5 5s seems the most plausible given my hand. I'm not confident enough to challenge, as Player 0 could have several 3s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 3, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 1, 7. I only have one 5. The current bid is 5 5s, which requires at least four more 5s in Player 1's hand. Given that Player 1 previously increased the bid from 3 5s to 5 5s, it suggests confidence, but having five or more 5s total is statistically unlikely. On average, each digit appears roughly 1.6 times per player (16 digits / 10 digits). Expecting five 5s total is a stretch unless Player 1 has at least four, which is improbable. Therefore, I should challenge.
