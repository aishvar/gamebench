--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 3 9s leverages the highest possible digit and a plausible total count. The opponent has 8 unknown digits, so there's a chance they hold at least one more 9. Bidding on a high digit like 9 limits their ability to outbid with the same quantity but higher digit, forcing them to increase the quantity instead.

Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s. I don't have any 9s, but I can bid 4 5s, increasing both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s. The current bid is 4 5s. Bidding 4 9s is higher in digit value. If the opponent has at least two 9s, the total meets the bid. This seems a safer bet than challenging.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand, making it unlikely that there are 4 9s in total. However, I have two 5s and one 3. Bidding 5 3s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit and quantity slightly, making it a valid bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 3S'
Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. My hand has only one 3, requiring the opponent to have at least four 3s. Given the bid history and the low probability of the opponent holding four 3s in their 8-digit hand, challenging seems advantageous.
