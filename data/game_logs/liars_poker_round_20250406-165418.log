Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a low bid. I have two 3s in my hand, so bidding one 3 is a safe starting point.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 1 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 6, 4, 4, 1, 9, 8, 5, 7, and no 3s. Since the current bid is only 1 3s, it's very likely that at least one 3 exists in both hands combined, given 16 digits total. Challenging now would be risky. To safely increase the bid, I should choose a digit I hold multiple copies of. I have two 4s, so bidding 2 4s is a safe and reasonable increase over 1 3s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I don't have any 4s in my hand. There are 16 total digits in play. Bidding 3 4s is possible, but risky. I have two 3s in my hand, and the last bid I made was 1 3s, so I can bid 3 3s without revealing much new information and increasing the quantity.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 6, 4, 4, 1, 9, 8, 5, 7, which means I have zero 3s. The current bid is 3 3s. Since I hold none, all three 3s would have to be in Player 0's hand. The probability that Player 0 has exactly three or more 3s in their eight digits is quite low. Given this, it's unlikely that there are at least three 3s in total, so challenging is the best move.
