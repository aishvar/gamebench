Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (34052509), I have two 0s. Bidding 2 0s is the safest and most reasonable starting bid, as it's the lowest possible valid bid and I know I have at least two 0s in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 3 3s is a reasonable move as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 3s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 3, increasing the quantity to 4 3s is risky without knowing the other player's hand. However, I can safely bid 4 0s because I have two 0s in my hand, and the current bid is only 3 3s. This increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a valid and reasonable bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'

Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are 4 0s in total. I should challenge this bid.
