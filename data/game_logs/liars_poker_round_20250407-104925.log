Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the opening bid, so I want to start conservatively but with a reasonable digit. In my hand, I have three 6s (digits: 6, 0, 1, 6, 8, 1, 6, 7). Starting with 3 6s leverages my strong holding, making it less risky and putting pressure on my opponent.
