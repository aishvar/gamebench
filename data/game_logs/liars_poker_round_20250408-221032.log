Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 3 6s seems like a reasonable opening bet that there should be at least one more 6 in the other hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (from 72164350). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have much information about the other player's hand, I'll play it safe. I can bid 4 6s, increasing the quantity, which is a reasonable move given that there are at least 2 sixes in total (one from my hand and potentially one from the other player's hand).

--- Turn: Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold 2 of the 6s already. To reach 4 total, the opponent must have exactly 2 more 6s, which is not very likely. I suspect a bluff and prefer to challenge rather than risk a higher bid.
