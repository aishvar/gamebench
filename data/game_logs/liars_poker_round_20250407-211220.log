--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. My hand contains the digits 6, 2, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, and 4. The digit 0 appears three times, which is the highest count of any digit in my hand. A good opening bid is to start with a conservative estimate based on my hand that is likely to be valid but not overly aggressive. Therefore, bidding '3 0' is reasonable, as I know there are at least 3 zeros in total (my own hand), and potentially more in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. My hand contains no zeros, so the opponent must have at least 3 zeros for the bid to be valid. The probability of an opponent having 3 or more zeros in their 8 digits is low (~4%). Challenging is statistically favorable since the bid is likely a bluff.
