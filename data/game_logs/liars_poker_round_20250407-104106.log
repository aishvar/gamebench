Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Since I have two 5s and two 6s, I can confidently increase the bid by quantity or digit. A safe and strategic move is to bid 2 5s, leveraging my own hand's strength while keeping the bid conservative.
