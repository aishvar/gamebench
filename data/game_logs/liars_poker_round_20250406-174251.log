Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. I could bid higher, but since the previous player is a naive 50/50 player, there's a reasonable chance they are bluffing or don't have many 5s. I'll challenge to see if they're overconfident.
