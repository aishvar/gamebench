--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand has one each of 0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8. As the first bidder, I'll start with a plausible bid of 2 8s. I contribute one 8, so if the opponent has at least one 8, the total meets the bid. This maintains flexibility while setting a mid-range digit that forces the opponent to bid higher quantities or digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. Looking at my hand, 70547131, I don't have any 8s. However, since the bid is relatively low, I should consider the possibility that the other player might have at least two 8s or is bluffing. Given that I don't have any 8s and the bid is already at 2, challenging seems like a reasonable strategy, especially since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and it's unlikely for there to be many 8s.
