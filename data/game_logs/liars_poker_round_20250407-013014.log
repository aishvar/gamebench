Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and it's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 99893025, which contains three 9s, one 8, one 5, one 3, one 2, and one 0. Since I have three 9s out of my eight digits, this is my strongest digit. The total number of digits in play is 16 (2 players * 8 digits). Statistically, the opponent is likely to have at least one 9 among their eight digits. Therefore, bidding '4 9s' is a reasonable opening bid that leverages the strength of my hand while assuming a likely scenario for the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (72341326), I have zero 9s. Since I hold half the digits and none are 9s, the entire count of 9s depends on my opponent's hand. For the bid of 4 9s to be valid, the opponent would need all 4 or more 9s in their 8 digits, which is unlikely. The probability of having 4 or more of any specific digit in 8 random digits is low. Therefore, it's reasonable to challenge this bid.
