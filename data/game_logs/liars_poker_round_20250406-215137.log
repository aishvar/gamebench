Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have the digits 8, 7, 3, 1, 6, 0, 4 in my hand, which gives me a good spread of numbers. Since there are no previous bids, I should start with a reasonable bid that reflects my hand. I can confidently bid 1 8, as I have one 8 in my hand and it sets a foundation for future bidding.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 67493126, I have zero 8s. Since the current bid is only 1 8s, it's quite plausible that my opponent has at least one 8, so challenging now is risky. The minimal safe raise is to 1 9s, which is a strictly higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). I have one 9 in my hand, making this a reasonable incremental bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 and one 0 in my hand, but no 9s. The current bid is 1 9s, which is quite low considering there are 16 total digits. I can bid 2 8s, which is a higher quantity than the previous bid and matches my hand. This seems like a reasonable move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 67493126, I have zero 8s. The current bid is 2 8s, which would require both 8s to be in the opponent's hand. Since the probability of the opponent having exactly two 8s out of eight digits is fairly low, it's unlikely the total count of 8s is at least two. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
