Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Since this is the first bid, I can start with any digit. Bidding 2 8s seems reasonable as it's based on my hand and sets a low bar for the next player.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. The current bid is 2 8s, which is plausible assuming the opponent has at least one 8. Since I have one 8, a safe incremental bid is 2 9s, which is a strictly higher bid by digit but keeps the quantity the same. This puts pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand, so the total can be at most two if Player 1 has two. However, it's unlikely that Player 1 has two 9s, making challenging a favorable move.
