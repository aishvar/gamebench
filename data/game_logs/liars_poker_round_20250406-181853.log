Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, so it's likely there's at least one 0 in total. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 1 1s is a reasonable next step as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid.
