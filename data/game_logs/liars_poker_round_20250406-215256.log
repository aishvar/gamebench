--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to make an initial bid based on my hand. I have two 1s, two 2s, one 3, one 6, one 8, and one 9. Bidding on a digit that appears frequently in my hand is a good strategy. I'll start with a conservative bid of two 2s, as I have two 2s in my hand and it's a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid is 2 2s. Bidding 2 3s is a valid higher bid since the digit 3 is higher than 2, and I have enough in my hand to support this bid.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 2 3s, which is possible if the opponent has at least one more 3. Since I have one 3, it's plausible that the total count is at least 2. However, to stay safe and increase the bid, I can bid 2 4s, which is a higher digit but the same quantity, based on the fact that I have one 4 in my hand.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 2 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 2 4s, meaning there must be at least two 4s in total. Since I have one, the opponent must have at least one. However, considering the opponent's pattern of increasing the digit each turn, they might be bluffing. Challenging is a good move because if there's only one 4, I win. If there are two, I lose, but the risk seems manageable.
