Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid. I will start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 9s, so bidding 2 9s seems reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, making it unlikely that there are many 9s overall. However, since the current bid is only 2 9s, it's still plausible there are at least two 9s between both hands. I should make a higher bid to avoid challenging prematurely. I have three 7s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid 3 7s as a reasonable next move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 8, 2, 9, 1, 0, 9, 3, and 8. I can see if I have enough of a specific digit to make a valid higher bid. The current bid is 3 7s, so I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 9s in my hand, which could be useful. Bidding 4 9s seems reasonable as it's higher in quantity than 3 and higher in digit than 7, and I have two 9s to back up this claim.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 9s. Based on my hand, it is unlikely that there are 4 9s across both players' hands since there are only 16 digits in total. Player 0 has consistently bid on 9s, likely trying to bluff or capitalize on uncertainty. I should challenge this bid as it seems improbable.
