Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. I need to establish an opening bid. My hand is 65847219, containing one 8. With 16 total digits in play (8 for me, 8 for the opponent), the expected number of any specific digit is 1.6. Bidding '2 8s' is a reasonable opening bid. I possess one 8, and it is statistically probable (more likely than not) that the opponent holds at least one 8 among their 8 digits. This bid is plausible and starts the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. Since the current bid is 2 8s, and I can reasonably expect the opponent might have at least one 8 as well, the bid is plausible. To raise, the minimal strictly higher bid would be 2 9s, but since I also have one 9, this is a safe incremental bid that increases the digit without increasing quantity, maintaining pressure without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 65847219. The current bid is 2 9s, made by Player 1. I have one 9 in my hand. For the bid to be true, Player 1 needs to have at least one 9 in their 8-digit hand, which is reasonably likely. Challenging seems risky as the bid is low and plausible. The next possible bid must have a quantity of 3 (since 2 9s is the highest bid with quantity 2). I have no duplicate digits in my hand. Bidding '3' of any digit I hold requires the opponent to have at least two of that digit. Bidding '3 0s' is the lowest possible valid bid. It increases the quantity minimally and puts the pressure back on the opponent without relying heavily on my own hand, as I hold no 0s.

Player 0 bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 0s (digits: 1,5,8,2,1,0,9,4). The current bid is 3 0s, so I personally hold two-thirds of the claimed count. Given that, it is quite plausible that the opponent has at least 1 zero, making the total at least 3 zeros, so challenging now would be risky. The minimal valid raise is either 3 1s (same quantity, higher digit) or 4 0s (higher quantity). Since I also have two 1s, raising to 3 1s is reasonable, as it's likely there are 3 or more 1s combined. I'll raise to 3 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one '1' in my hand (65847219). For the bid to be true, Player 1 must have at least two '1's in their 8-digit hand. The expected number of '1's in the total 16 digits is 1.6. Since I have one '1', the expected number of '1's in Player 1's hand is 0.6. Requiring Player 1 to have two '1's is significantly above the expected value. While possible, it feels unlikely enough to warrant a challenge, especially since the bid level is still relatively low (quantity 3). Making a higher bid, like '3 2s', would require Player 1 to have two '2's (since I have one '2'), which is similarly questionable. Bidding quantity 4 seems too risky given my diverse hand with only one of most digits. Challenging '3 1s' seems like the statistically better move.
