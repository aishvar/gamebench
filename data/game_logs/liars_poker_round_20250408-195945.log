Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: With no current bid, this is an ideal time to open the bidding. My hand (72547865) shows that I have two 7s, which gives me a solid base for a bid. Bidding '2 7s' is a conservative yet strategic move—it leverages my known count while still leaving room to maneuver as the game progresses since the total pool of digits is 16.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. I have a few high digits in my hand, but I also need to consider the possibility of Player 0 having a strong hand. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Given that I have a '6' and a '9' in my hand, bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to 2 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 7s in my hand, making it relatively likely that there are at least three 7s among the total 16 digits — I only need the opponent to have one 7. The current bid of 3 6s is risky for me since I have just one 6, and the probability of there being two additional 6s in the opponent’s hand is low. Therefore, raising the bid to 3 7s is a safer play and is a valid move (being strictly higher than 3 6s by digit).

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have a 7 in my hand, which makes 3 7s possible but not certain. Given that the maximum quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 16 digits in total, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems strategic. My hand contains one 7, so I can reasonably assume there's at least one more 7 or other high digits in Player 0's hand. I will increase the bid slightly to test the waters.

Player 1 bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid of '4 7s' requires that there be at least two additional 7s in my opponent's 8-digit hand—a scenario with roughly an 18-19% chance. Given the low probability that the opponent holds enough 7s to support the bid, it is wise to challenge.
