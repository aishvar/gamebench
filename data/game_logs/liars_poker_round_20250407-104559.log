Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 8s, and one each of 6, 3, 1, 2, and 5. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 8s, reflecting my own count. This is a safe start that doesn't overcommit but still pressures the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 69389125, I have two 9s. Since the current bid is 2 9s, and I already hold two of them, it is highly probable that there are more 9s in total, or at least the bid is valid. Challenging now would be risky. The next valid bid must be strictly higher, so I can either increase the quantity to 3 0s or bid 3 9s to directly increase the quantity for the same digit. Given my strong holding with two 9s, bidding 3 9s is a safe and strategic move.
