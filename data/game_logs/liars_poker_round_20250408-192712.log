Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 7 in my hand, which guarantees at least one 7 in play. Since no bid has been made yet, a low initial bid is a safe starting point. Bidding '1 7s' comfortably sets the pace without overstating the claim, giving me room to maneuver in subsequent rounds.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 75491036, and I have a 9, which gives me direct support for bidding on 9s. The current bid is '1 8s', so I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Bidding '1 9s' is a minimal increase since it keeps the same quantity but uses a higher digit. With 16 total digits in play, claiming at least one 9 is very likely to be true, and my hand reassures that this bid is safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I know that I hold a 1 (from my hand 75491036) which guarantees one '1'. The current bid is 2 0s and must be raised by either increasing the quantity or moving to a higher digit. Bidding 2 1s is the minimal legal raise, and given that the opponent has 8 unknown digits, itâ€™s reasonably likely they hold at least one 1. Therefore, rather than challenge a bid that has about a 57% chance of being valid (since I already have one 0 and the opponent would need at least one), I choose to raise the bid to 2 1s.
