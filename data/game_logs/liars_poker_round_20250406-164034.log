Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid. I will start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have three 5s and two 6s. A bid of 3 5s seems reasonable given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 5s. This means at least two more 5s would need to be in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. While this is possible, I can make a safer and reasonable higher bid by increasing the quantity and switching to a digit I have more of. I have two 7s, so bidding 4 7s increases the quantity and leverages my hand's strengths.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 4, 3, 8, 5, 5, 6, 1, and 7. I have two 5s and two 7s but no 8s or higher quantity of 7s to make a significantly higher bid with confidence. However, I can try to make a slightly higher bid by increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 5s and my opponent has already bid 4 7s, I can increase the quantity or the digit. I will increase the digit and bid 4 8s as I have one 8 and it seems like a reasonable bid given the information.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. Looking at my hand, I do not have any 8s, which makes it less likely that there are 4 or more 8s across both hands. Given that the maximum total digits are 16, and I have no 8s, it would require Player 0 to have at least 4 8s in their hand, which seems improbable. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
