--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start by bidding 1 9s. This is a reasonable starting point as I have one 9, and the opponent might have another, making the total at least one.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 1 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, but the current bid is only 1 9s. Since the other player has 8 digits, it's possible they have at least one 9. However, I can make a higher bid based on the digits in my hand. I have two 6s, so bidding 2 6s is a safe increase in quantity while keeping the digit reasonable.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 6S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, making the total possible 6s between 1 (if Player 1 has none) and 2 or more (if Player 1 has one or more). Challenging the bid tests whether the total meets or exceeds 2, which seems uncertain without more information.
