Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start by making an opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have the digits: 3, 1, 4, 1, 7, 2, 2, 3. Counting the digits, I see two 1s, two 2s, two 3s, one 4, and one 7. A good opening bid is usually conservative, reflecting a digit I have multiple times, such as 2 or 3, and assuming the opponent likely has at least one or two of the same digit. Therefore, bidding 3 twos or 3 threes could be reasonable, but starting with 2 twos or 2 threes is safer and more standard. I'll choose to open with 2 threes, as I hold two 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. My hand contains zero 3s. It's highly unlikely the opponent has enough 3s in their hand to make this bid true, given they have 8 cards. Bidding higher would be risky as I have no 3s to support a higher bid on 3s, and bidding on another number would likely be a bluff. Challenging seems like the best option to potentially end the round with a win.
