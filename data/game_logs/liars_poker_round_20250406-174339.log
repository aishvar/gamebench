Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. Since the opponent is a Naive 50/50 player, they might be bluffing. However, it's still very early in the game, and challenging a bid of 1 0s is too risky. I will make a safe bid based on the digits I have in my hand. I have two 3s, so I will bid 2 3s.
