Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 2 9s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 9.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 86469852, I have no 9s. The opponent bid 2 9s, which means they would need to have at least 2 nines in their hand for this to be true. While possible, having 2 or more of any specific digit in an 8-digit random hand is less common. Given I have zero 9s and it's a relatively early bid, I think it's worth challenging rather than making a higher bid. The probability of them having 2+ nines when I have zero is low enough to warrant a challenge.
