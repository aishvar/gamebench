Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 8s, and two 2s, which suggests these digits are good candidates. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I will start with 3 5s, as I already hold two and expect at least one more in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 6s (digits are 7,5,5,8,3,8,2,2). The current bid is 3 6s, which requires at least three 6s across both hands. Since I hold zero 6s, all three would need to be in Player 1's hand of eight digits. The probability of that is low, and given the naive opponent's tendency, it's likely an overbid. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move.
