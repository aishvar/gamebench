Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 9s, one 4, one 6, one 5, and one 1. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 9s, matching the number of 9s in my hand, which is a common opening strategy.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 9s. Since I don't have any 9s, it's unlikely that there are 2 or more 9s in total. I should challenge the bid.
