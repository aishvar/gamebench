Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my first turn. I need to make an initial bid. I will analyze my hand: '02776374'. The digit '7' appears twice, which is the highest count of any single digit in my hand. Since there are 16 digits in total (8 from each player), I should start with a conservative but strategic bid. I will bid on the digit '7' with a quantity of '2'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my first turn. I should make a conservative bid to test the waters. Analyzing my hand '02776374', I have a total of 3 '0's, 1 '2's, 1 '3's, 1 '4's, 1 '6's, 1 '7's. The highest count of any digit in my hand is 3 (for '0'). I will bid on '0' with a quantity of 3, as it's a low-risk bid given the current state of the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 zeros. I have one zero in my hand. My opponent could have anywhere from 0 to 8 zeros. To make the bid likely false, they would need to have at least 3 zeros, meaning there are at least 4 zeros in total. It's plausible that there are 3 or more zeros in total. I will bid higher, increasing the quantity. Bidding 4 zeros seems reasonable as it's not an extreme jump and tests the opponent's hand. I have enough information to make a reasonable bid without immediately challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (02776374), I count 3 zeros. The current bid is '4 0s'. Since my hand contains 3 zeros, which is less than the current bid of 4 zeros, and I need to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should consider if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more strategic. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and I have 3 zeros, I can see there's a possibility the other player might have more zeros or I could bid on a different digit. However, bidding on a higher quantity of a different digit might be risky without knowing the other player's hand. I notice that I have 2 sevens, which could be a strategic bid. The current bid is 4 of a digit (0) that I have 3 of, so I should consider bidding on a digit I have more of or think is less likely for the other player to have in high quantity. Since I have 2 sevens and no information suggests the other player has many sevens, I could make a bid of '5 7s' as it could be a strategic move to increase the quantity or digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (02776374), I see I have 3 zeros. The current bid is 4 0s made by Player 1. Given that I have 3 zeros and the maximum possible quantity is 16, I need to assess if bidding higher or challenging is optimal. Since I have fewer than 4 zeros, I should consider if there's a higher digit I can bid on or challenge the current bid. My hand does not support a higher bid of 0s than 4, but I can evaluate if challenging is wise or if there's a better digit to bid on.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. The opponent previously bid 4 0s after I bid 3 0s, indicating they likely have at least one 0. It's possible they have two or three 0s. Given the opponent's previous bid and my hand, it's plausible they have enough 1s to support the bid. However, bidding higher than 4 1s is risky. I will challenge the bid, as it seems unlikely that there are four 1s in total between both hands. If the opponent has more than one 1, they would have likely bid on 1s earlier. The opponent's earlier bid of 4 0s does not strongly suggest they have multiple 1s.
