Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 0s, one 1, one 3, one 6, one 7, and two 8s. Starting with a bid of 2 8s is reasonable as I already have two 8s in my hand, making it likely that there are at least two 8s in total across all players.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 8s'. This is a very low bid, as the expected number of any digit across 24 total digits is 2.4. Challenging this bid is risky, as it's statistically likely to be true even though I have no 8s in my hand (45142359). The other two players only need a combined total of two 8s among their 16 digits. Therefore, I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 4s and two 5s. Bidding based on my hand is a strong strategy. I can bid '3 4s' or '3 5s'. Bidding '3 5s' is a valid higher bid (increasing quantity) and is supported by my hand, requiring only one more 5 among the other 16 digits.

Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 10983726, which contains one 7 and no 5s. The current bid is 3 5s. I need to make a higher bid than 3 5s. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 5s, I think the bid of 3 5s might be a bit aggressive, but I shouldn't challenge yet as it's still a relatively low bid. I see that I have a 7, so bidding 3 7s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit. This is a cautious increase, reflecting that I don't have information about other players' hands but am trying to make a sensible bid based on my own hand.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand (08017836). The current bid is 3 7s, which means there needs to be at least two more 7s among the other two players' hands (since I have one). Given that there are 16 other digits in play (8 per player), it's possible but not certain. However, since the bid is relatively low (3 of a digit), I can make a safer higher bid based on my hand. I have two 8s, so bidding 4 8s increases the quantity significantly and uses a higher digit, making it a strong bid that's harder to challenge.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 45142359. The current bid is 4 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand. For the bid to be true, the other two players must have at least four 8s combined in their 16 digits. While possible, Player 0's jump from 2 8s to 4 8s after intermediate bids could be a bluff, but also suggests confidence. Challenging feels risky without more information. I need to bid higher than 4 8s. Options are 4 9s or increasing the quantity to 5. I have one 9, so bidding 4 9s requires three more 9s out of 16. Bidding 5 of something seems better. I have two 4s and two 5s. Bidding 5 4s requires three more 4s among the other 16 digits. Bidding 5 5s requires three more 5s. Both are statistically plausible and leverage my hand. Bidding 5 4s seems slightly preferable as 4s haven't been bid yet, whereas I previously bid 3 5s. Bidding 5 4s is a reasonably safe increase based on my hand.

Player 2 response was not valid JSON after cleaning: 'To determine the best course of action, let's first analyze the given information:

1. **Your Hand**: 10983726
   - Let's count the digits in your hand: 
     - 1 appears once,
     - 0 once,
     - 9 once,
     - 8 once,
     - 3 once,
     - 7 once,
     - 2 once,
     - 6 once.
   - Your hand contains a total of 8 digits with no repeating digits.

2. **Current Bid**: 5 4s
   - The current bid is made by Player 1, suggesting that there are at least 5 fours across all players' hands.

3. **Bid History**:
   - The bidding started with 2 8s by Player 0.
   - Player 1 bid 3 5s, increasing both quantity and digit.
   - You (Player 2) bid 3 7s, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit.
   - Player 0 then bid 4 8s, increasing the quantity.
   - Player 1 bid 5 4s, increasing the quantity.

Given that the current bid is 5 4s, to make a higher bid, you need to either bid a higher quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid a higher digit.

Let's analyze your hand: You have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 6, one 7, one 8, and one 9. Notably, you don't have any 4s. The presence or absence of 4s in your hand doesn't directly influence your decision since you're not bidding on your hand alone, but considering the total count across all hands.

To make a valid higher bid than 5 4s, you could either bid a higher quantity (e.g., 6 Xs) or the same quantity with a higher digit (e.g., 5 5s).

1. **Bidding a Higher Quantity**: 
   - Bidding 6 4s is a possibility, suggesting there are at least 6 fours. This is a relatively safe bid since it only increases the quantity by 1.

2. **Bidding the Same Quantity with a Higher Digit**:
   - You could bid 5 5s. This implies there are at least 5 fives across all hands. Given that you have one 3 and no 4s or 5s, and considering the previous bids (especially 3 5s by Player 1 and 3 7s by you), it's plausible that there could be 5 fives.

Let's consider the likelihood and potential outcomes:
- The total number of digits across all hands is 24 (8 digits per player * 3 players).
- Bidding 5 5s or 6 4s seems reasonable. However, since you don't have a 4 or 5 in your hand, and the previous bid was 5 4s, bidding 6 4s might be stretching a bit unless you believe the other players have a significant number of 4s.

Given the information and the need to make a decision:
- **Reasoning**: The current bid is 5 4s. I can either increase the quantity or keep it the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have a 4 or 5, and given the previous bids, bidding 5 5s seems like a reasonable action. It keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit, which is a valid move according to the rules. It's also somewhat conservative, as it doesn't assume a very high count of a specific digit across all hands.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. My hand is 10983726, which contains one 4. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 24 digits in total and the current bid is 5 4s, it's plausible that there are at least 5 fours. However, bidding 6 4s might be too high without more information. I can see that I have a 7 and an 8 and other digits, but no other 4s. A safer bid would be to increase the digit instead. Bidding 5 5s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one '5' in my hand (from 08017836). The current bid is 5 5s, which means there would need to be at least four more '5's among the other two players' hands (since I only have one). Given that the total number of digits is 24, and the bid history shows a steady increase in bids, it's possible but not certain that the other players have enough '5's to meet this bid. However, since I only have one '5', I think it's unlikely that there are four more '5's in the other players' hands. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
