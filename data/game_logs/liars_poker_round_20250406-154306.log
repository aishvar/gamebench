Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without fear of being challenged. I see I have two 8s and two 5s in my hand. A bid of 2 5s or 2 8s seems reasonable and low-risk.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s and no 5s. The current bid is 2 5s, which is plausible, but since I have no 5s, I'm less confident to increase on 5s. However, I have two 6s, so a natural higher bid would be 2 6s, but that is not a valid raise as it doesn't increase quantity or digit compared to 2 5s. To outbid, I can bid 2 6s (same quantity, higher digit), which is valid. Since I hold two 6s myself, it's very likely there are at least two 6s in total, making this a safe incremental bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have a 6 in my hand, and I can see that bidding a higher quantity or digit could be advantageous. Since I have one 6, I know there are at least 2 6s in total. My hand also contains a 5, but focusing on 6s seems strategic. I will increase the quantity and keep the digit higher than 6, as there are no guarantees about the distribution of digits in the opponent's hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 6, 2, 9, 6, 9, 0, 7, 4. This includes one 7. The current bid is 3 7s, so for the bid to be valid, there must be at least two more 7s in Player 0's hand. Since each player only has 8 digits, it's somewhat unlikely Player 0 has two or more 7s, but not impossible. However, I also have two 6s, making a bid of 3 8s or 3 9s risky, but bidding 4 6s is a safer increase because I already hold two 6s, so at least two more 6s in the opponent's hand is plausible. Therefore, I will raise to 4 6s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid is incorrect. My hand contains the digits 8, 1, 5, 0, 4, 5, 4, 2. I have two 5s and two 4s, but no 6s. The bid of 4 6s seems high given that I only see my own digits and have no 6s. However, since I do not have any 6s, I will not increase the bid for 6s. I will bid 4 7s or higher if possible, but I only have one 7. Thus, I can only safely bid 3 7s or lower. I will increase the quantity and keep the digit higher than 6, or increase the digit. A safe bet would be to bid 5 0s, as there are 8 digits and it seems unlikely that there are 4 or more 6s in total.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (62969074), I have the digits: 6, 2, 9, 6, 9, 0, 7, 4. Counting 7s, I only have one. The current bid is 5 7s, meaning there must be at least 5 sevens across both hands. Since I have only one, the opponent would need at least 4 sevens, which is quite unlikely given 8 digits. The probability of them holding 4 or more sevens is low. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
