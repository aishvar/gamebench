Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 2, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 8, one 9, and two 1s. The most common digit in my hand is '1' with two occurrences. A safe and reasonable opening bid is '2 1s', reflecting my own hand and leaving room for escalation.
