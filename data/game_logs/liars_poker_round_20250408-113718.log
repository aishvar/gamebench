Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have three 0s, two 2s, and two 3s. The safest opening bid is on a digit I have multiple times. I will start conservatively with 3 0s, reflecting my own hand and leaving room to escalate.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s, which is a very low quantity for any digit. Considering my hand, I have one 0 and no other zeros. It's unlikely that there are only 3 zeros in total. I should challenge the current bid.
