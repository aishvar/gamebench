--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there has been no bid yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, the counts of digits are: 8(1), 3(1), 9(2), 4(2), 7(2). The highest counts are for 9, 4, and 7, each appearing twice. Opening with a bid on a digit I have multiple times is generally safer, as it increases the likelihood that the total count across both hands supports my bid. Therefore, a conservative and strong opening bid would be 2 of 9s.
