Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to start the bidding. I have a good hand with digits 9, 7, 8, 6, 1, 4, 5, and 2. I will bid 1 of the highest digit I have, which is 9. This is a reasonable starting point.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s, so the current bid of 1 9s is plausible but not guaranteed. Since I must raise the bid, the safest minimal increase is to bid 1 9s -> 1 0s, but that is not allowed as digit is lower. The next minimal valid bid is 1 9s -> 2 0s or 2 9s, but I have two 0s in my hand, making a bid of 2 0s quite reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, and the current bid of 2 0s seems unlikely since there are only 16 digits total. I should challenge this bid as it is improbable that there are at least 2 zeros among both hands.
