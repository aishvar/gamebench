Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand, and starting with a bid of 2 4s is reasonable. It's a modest bid that's supported by my hand, and the opponent might have more, making the total count higher. Choosing a higher digit like 4 also makes the bid stronger compared to bidding on 0s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 2 4s. Since I only have one, it's possible the opponent has at least one more, making their bid valid. To stay competitive, I can bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 3 6s is a reasonable move.

Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s. I can make a higher bid by choosing a higher digit. Bidding 1 8s is valid because 8 is higher than 6, and I have at least one 8, ensuring the bid is safe.
