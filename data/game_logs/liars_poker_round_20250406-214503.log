Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is 1 0s, it is quite likely that at least one 0 exists in total, and challenging now would probably lose. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or the digit. I don't have multiple 0s, but I do have two 6s and two 7s, making those safer digits to bid on. I will increase the quantity to 2 and choose the digit 6, which I have two of, making a valid and safer higher bid.
