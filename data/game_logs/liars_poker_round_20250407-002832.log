Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 1 0s, which is very low. I can safely increase the bid by both quantity and digit. Bidding 2 3s seems reasonable, as I have two 3s in my hand and it's a higher bid than the current one.

Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 4s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 4s, bidding 3 4s is a reasonable option, as it increases the quantity while keeping the same digit.
