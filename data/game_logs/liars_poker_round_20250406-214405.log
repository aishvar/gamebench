Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 1 0s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have no 0s in my hand but do have repeated digits, I should consider bidding on a digit I have, aiming for a low quantity to minimize risk. Bidding on a digit I possess, like 1, 2, 3, 7, or 8, seems reasonable. Given the low current bid, increasing the quantity to 2 and choosing a digit I have multiple of, such as 1, 3, 7, or 8, would be a safe and logical next step. Among these, choosing '2 1s' seems like a balanced choice because it's a low digit and I have two 1s in my hand, but considering the need to balance risk and the potential for the other player to have 0s or other digits, I opt for a digit that is not too high but still reflects my hand's composition. Since I have two 7s and no 0s, and considering the other player might have 0s, bidding '2 7s' seems like a cautious yet progressive move, leveraging my hand's information without overextending into higher, riskier bids.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 2 8s and I have one 8 in my hand, I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Since I only have one 8, the total count of 8s must be at least 2 (one from me and one from the other player) to meet the current bid. To bid higher, I could increase the quantity or the digit. However, without more information about the other player's hand, bidding higher based on quantity seems risky. Given my hand (84217371), I notice I have two 7s and a 1, but no other repeating digits besides the single 8. The safest increase would be to bid on a digit I have multiple of, but since 7 is lower than 8, I must increase the quantity to bid higher. Considering the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and the fact that I have two 7s, bidding 3 7s seems reasonable because it increases the quantity while staying with a digit I know something about. This move also doesn't overcommit, given the limited information about the other player's hand.
