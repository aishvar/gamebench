Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 7, one 9, and one 2 (actually, two 2s). The most promising digit to start with is 2, which I have two of. A conservative but solid opening bid would be 2 2s, which is reasonable given my hand and forces the opponent to respond.
