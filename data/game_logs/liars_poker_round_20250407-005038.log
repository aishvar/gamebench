Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 6.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which means there must be at least two more 6s in Player 0's hand. However, I can increase the quantity to 4 and choose a digit I have more of, such as 4s, since I have two 4s in my hand. This bid is higher than the current bid and seems reasonable based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 4S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 4s. I can bid 5 6s, increasing both the quantity and digit from the previous bid. This is a reasonable bid given my hand and the current bid history.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, and the current bid is 5 6s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 6, increasing the quantity to 6 6s is risky without knowing the opponent's hand. However, I can safely bid 6 of a different digit that I have more of, such as 4s or 5s, but neither of those digits are higher than 6. Alternatively, I can bid 5 of a higher digit, such as 7s, but I only have one 7. Given the constraints, the most reasonable action is to challenge the current bid, as it seems unlikely that there are at least 5 6s in total with only one 6 in my hand.
