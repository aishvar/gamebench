Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains the digits 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9. I see that I have two 6s. A reasonable starting bid could be 2 6s, as it reflects the information I have about my own hand and allows me to get a feel for the game without overbidding.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, which makes it somewhat plausible that there are at least two 6s in total, given the other player's hand. However, I cannot challenge at this stage since the bid seems reasonable. To maintain the game and increase the bid, I will bid 3 6s, as it is a logical step up from the current bid and aligns with my hand's information.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, which means there are at least 5 sixes in total (including Player 1's 3 6s). Given that the bid is 3 6s and I have two 6s, I should consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should look for a digit that I have multiple instances of and bid higher than 3 6s. I have two 6s and other digits do not seem as promising. However, bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, and the current bid is 4 6s. Based on the maximum possible count of 16 digits across both players, there is a reasonable chance that Player 0 has multiple 6s in their hand, making the bid plausible. However, I do not have enough information to confidently challenge at this stage. Instead, I will raise the bid to 4 7s, as I do not have any 7s in my hand, making it a safer digit to escalate the bid without overcommitting to a high quantity.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 1. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 6, 6, 9, 0, 1, 5, 3, 8. The maximum possible quantity for any digit across both players' hands is 16. The current bid of 4 7s seems potentially high but I need to consider if I can safely make a higher bid. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. Given that I have two 6s and the last bid was 4 6s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. The bid of 4 7s seems risky because if I challenge and lose, Player 1 could have a strong hand. However, I can try to bid higher with a digit I have. I will increase the quantity and bid 5 6s because I have two 6s and it seems like a reasonable increase.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, and the current bid is 5 6s. Based on the bidding history, Player 0 seems to be confident in the presence of 6s, repeatedly increasing the bid on this digit. However, with only 16 digits in total and my single 6, it is unlikely that there are 5 or more 6s across both hands. I believe challenging is the best move here, as the bid seems improbable.
