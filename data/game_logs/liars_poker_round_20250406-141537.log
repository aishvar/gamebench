Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (02741625), I count 2 1s, 1 2s, 1 4s, 1 5s, and 1 6s, and 1 0s and 1 7s. Since I have the most 1s, I will start by bidding on 1s. A reasonable starting bid is the total count of 1s I have. I'll bid 3 1s, slightly more than my count to be cautious and encourage others to think before bidding.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 7, 7, 1, 8, 9, 0, 6, 3. I see two 1s in my hand, so I know there are at least 2 1s in total (including Player 0's and Player 2's hands). To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 1s, bidding 4 1s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The bid is at 4 1s. Looking at my hand (63383926), I don't have any 1s. Since there are 24 total digits in play (8 digits per player Ã— 3 players), and I know my 8 digits contain zero 1s, that means all 4+ claimed 1s would have to be in the other players' hands. Player 0 initially bid 3 1s, suggesting they might have at least 1-2 ones in their hand. Player 1 raised to 4 1s, indicating they might have at least 1-2 ones as well. This seems plausible. I could safely bid 4 2s (same quantity, higher digit) or increase the quantity to 5 with a digit I have. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 9s, one 6, one 8, one 2, and one 6. I'll bid 4 2s to play it safe while advancing the bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have a lot of high digits in my hand, I'll consider increasing the digit. I see that I have two 5s, which is a relatively high count for a single digit in my hand. Bidding 4 5s seems reasonable as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit from 2 to 5.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or challenge. My hand contains a 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, and three other digits (7, 1, 5, 3, 0). I see that bidding higher than 4 requires at least 5 of a certain digit or quantity. Given my digits and the goal to make a higher bid, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 5 and the bid is for 5s, I should think if there's a possibility to increase the quantity or digit. I have one 5 which could contribute to a higher count if others have more. However, without knowing others' hands, I must make an educated guess. The bid of 4 5s seems potentially beatable if others have many 5s or if I can find a higher digit with a reasonable quantity. I have no 5s other than the one I know of, but I do have other digits that could potentially be part of a higher count.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current state to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. In my hand, I have one 6 (63383926). The current bid is 5 6s total across all players. For this to be true, the other two players would need to have at least 4 more 6s between them, which is certainly possible. Looking at the bid history, Player 1 just increased from Player 0's '4 5s' to '5 6s', which suggests they might have at least one 6 in their hand. Given that I only have one 6, I could bid '5 7s', '5 8s', or '5 9s' (keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit), or increase the quantity to '6' with any digit. Since I have two 3s in my hand, bidding '6 3s' seems reasonable - I already account for 2 of them, and need only 4 more between the other players, which is plausible.

Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 6 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. I have the digits 0, 2, 7, 4, 1, 6, 2, 5 in my hand, with no 3s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I see two 2s and no 3s in my hand, and considering the bid history, bidding 6 4s seems reasonable as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit. However, I should also consider the likelihood of others having 4s. Given that the previous bids were on lower digits and then jumped to 3s, it's possible that there's a significant number of 3s or other lower digits. I will bid 7 3s, increasing the quantity, as it directly challenges the current bid and is a relatively safe increase given the context.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 7 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 3s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 7, 7, 1, 8, 9, 0, 6, 3. I see that I have two 7s and one 6, and one 3. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24, and there are already 7 threes bid, I should consider if I can safely make a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent. Since I have two 7s, bidding 8 7s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and digit compared to the current bid of 7 3s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 8 7s

--- Turn: Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '8 7s' and decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge. In my hand (63383926), I have zero 7s. The current bid claims there are at least 8 sevens among all players. With 24 total digits in play and 0 sevens in my hand, there would need to be 8 sevens distributed between the other two players. While possible, this seems unlikely. Each player has 8 digits, so the other two players would need to have 8 sevens between them, meaning on average 4 sevens each or a very skewed distribution. Given the bid history, Player 1 has been aggressive with their bidding, jumping from 7 3s to 8 7s. This significant jump in both quantity and digit value suggests they might be bluffing. I think challenging is the best move here.
