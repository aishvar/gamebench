Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make an initial bid based on my hand. I have two 7s. I will bid a small amount to start.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (from 02414305). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. I see that increasing the quantity to 3 is a reasonable move. Since I have one 7, it's plausible that there's at least one more 7 between the two hands. Bidding 3 7s is a safe increase in quantity without changing the digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. It's early in the game, and I don't have strong evidence to challenge. I can conservatively raise the bid to 4 7s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (from 02414305). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have a lot of 7s or higher digits, I'll consider increasing the quantity. Bidding 5 7s is a reasonable move as it slightly increases the quantity, and it's still a relatively conservative bid given that there are 16 digits in total.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. It's possible that there are at least five 7s in total, but it's also possible the opponent is bluffing. Since the bidding has been escalating on 7s, and I only have one, I'll make a slightly higher bid of 6 7s to test the waters. If they challenge, I lose, but if they bid higher, I'll have more information.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I need to either challenge it or make a higher bid. My hand is 02414305, which contains one 7. The total number of 7s in both hands must be at least 1 (mine) + some from Player 0's hand. Given that Player 0 has bid up to 6 7s, it's possible they have 5 or more 7s. However, bidding 7 7s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid the same quantity with a higher digit. Bidding 6 8s is a viable option as it matches the quantity but increases the digit. I'll choose to bid 6 8s as it's a safer bet given the information I have.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. It's plausible that there are at least six 8s in total across both hands. I could bid 7 0s, but that feels risky. I will challenge to see if the previous player was bluffing.
