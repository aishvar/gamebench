Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, there are no 0s, so the total number of 0s across both hands is at most 8 (if the opponent has all 0s), but more realistically, likely 0-2. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, it's almost certainly true. Challenging now would be unwise. The minimal higher bid would be 1 1s. I have one 1 in my hand, so a bid of 1 1s is safe and strictly higher per the rules.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 1,9,3,2,8,3,4,3. I have one 2, so combined with the opponent's hand, there could reasonably be more 2s, but the current bid is only 1 2s, which is quite low. To maintain pressure and avoid challenging such a safe bid, I should raise incrementally. Since I have two 3s in my hand, a safe and natural next bid is '2 3s', which is a valid higher bid (raising the quantity from 1 to 2).

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 3s and one 4. The current bid is 2 4s, and since I only have one 4, for the bid to be valid Player 0 would need to have at least one or two more 4s. Given the distribution, it's plausible Player 0 has one 4, making the total exactly 2, which matches the current bid. Since I must raise, the safest valid higher bid based on my hand is to increase the quantity to 3 and select a digit I have multiple of. I have two 3s, so bidding 3 3s leverages my hand strength and puts pressure on Player 0.
