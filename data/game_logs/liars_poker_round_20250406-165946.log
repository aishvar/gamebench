Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I can start by bidding on a specific digit. I have two 6s in my hand, which gives me a good starting point. I'll choose a digit with a relatively high quantity, so I can try to set a baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding 3 6s is a valid option, but it doesn't gain much information. Bidding a different digit might be better. I have two 3s, two 2s, one 5, one 8. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and quantity. Alternatively, I could challenge the bid, but 2 6s doesn't seem incredibly unlikely, so I'll bid.

Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s. Considering my hand, I can bid 4 8s, increasing the quantity of the digit 8, which seems a reasonable move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. It's unlikely there are three more 8s in the other player's hand, but not impossible. However, bidding higher seems risky. I can bid 5 8s, but that's very aggressive. Alternatively, I can bid on a different digit. I have two 3s, two 2s, one 5, and one 1. Bidding 4 9s or 5 0s seems more reasonable than trying to increase the 8s. Since I have no 9s, I will bid on the 3s. Bidding 5 3s is a reasonable increase.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 3S'
Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 5 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Player 1's bid of 5 3s seems reasonable, but I have a 3 in my hand, so I should bid a higher quantity of 3s or a higher digit. Since I don't have any 4s or higher in my hand, I'll raise the quantity of 3s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 3S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 7 3s is a reasonable increase in quantity, as it's the most straightforward way to raise the bid. While I could bid a lower quantity on a higher digit, increasing the 3s seems safer given my hand.

Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 7 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 3 in my hand. The current bid is only 7 3s. Bidding 8 3s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 3S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 8 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 3s. I have three 3s in my hand. It's likely there are at least 9 3s total. Bidding 9 3s is a reasonable increase and seems plausible given my hand. While challenging is an option, I believe increasing the bid is more strategic at this point.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 3S'
Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 9 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 3s. I have one 3 in my hand, and I've seen a pattern where Player 1 tends to increase the digit by 1 in their subsequent bids. Given that I have a 3 in my hand, I should bid a higher digit to increase the chances of winning.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 4S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 10 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 4s. I have zero 4s in my hand. Given the history of bidding on 3s, and the increasing quantity, it's likely the other player is bluffing with the 4s. While I could bid higher, challenging seems like the more strategic play. The previous bids on 3s suggest a willingness to bluff, and 10 4s feels like a significant overbid, especially considering I have none. It's a reasonable risk to challenge.
