Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without directly challenging. I see I have two 6s and two 5s in my hand. A bid of 2 5s or 2 6s seems reasonable and not easily challengeable given the total possible digits are 16.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Since the quantity is low, I can reasonably increase the quantity or the digit. I can see that I have a 6 in my hand, which is higher than 5. I can also see that I have one 8 and one 2 in my hand, which are lower than 5, but I can still increase the quantity. I'll increase the quantity to 3 and keep the digit as 5, since it's a safe bet.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have two 6s in my hand, and the bid seems low considering the total possible digits. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s, bidding 4 6s seems reasonable and increases both the quantity and digit compared to the current bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. Since I have two 6s in my hand, I can confidently bid a higher quantity of 6s. However, I also have a 6 in my hand, and I can observe that the current digit is 6. Given that the current bid is already quite high, I should consider bidding a slightly higher quantity of 6s to increase my chances of winning. Therefore, I will bid 5 6s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, and I know that Player 1 has at least 5 6s in total from their bid. Given that I have a total of 3 6s in my hand, I should challenge this bid as it seems highly unlikely that there are 5 6s in total between both players.
