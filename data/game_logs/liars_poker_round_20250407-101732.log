Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 6s, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 8, and one 9. Starting with a conservative yet reasonable opening bid, I will choose 2 6s, matching my own count. This is a safe opening bid that reflects my hand strength and leaves room for escalation.
