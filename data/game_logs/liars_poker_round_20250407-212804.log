Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Analyzing my hand (7,8,4,5,1,7,9,3), I see two 7s, one 8, one 4, one 5, one 1, one 9, and one 3. The most frequent digit in my hand is 7, appearing twice. Opening with a bid on 7s is reasonable because I already hold two, and statistically, the opponent is likely to have at least one more among their eight digits, making a total of three or more plausible. Therefore, a conservative but solid opening bid would be 3 sevens.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (37880446), I see I have 3 sevens. The current bid is '3 7s'. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have enough sevens to increase the quantity confidently (as 3 is the maximum I can confirm), I should consider increasing the digit. The digits in my hand are 3, 7, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, and 6. The highest digit I have multiple instances of is 8 (two 8s), but I also see that I have two 4s. However, bidding on 8s or 4s wouldn't directly counter the current bid effectively without considering the possibility of Player 0 having more 7s than they claimed or the distribution of other numbers. Given that I have 3 sevens and the goal is to make a higher bid or challenge, I should consider if challenging could be an option or if I can safely increase the bid. If I challenge and lose, I risk being out of the game, but if I bid and lose, I only waste my turn. The current bid seems potentially beatable or challengeable based on the hands, but without exact information on Player 0's hand, I must make an educated guess.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 78451793, I have zero 8s. Since there are 8 digits in each hand, the total pool is 16 digits. For Player 1's bid of 4 8s to be valid, there must be at least 4 eights across both hands. Given I have none, Player 1 would need all 4 or more 8s in their hand, which is statistically unlikely. The probability of having 4 or more 8s in a random 8-digit hand is low (roughly 5% or less). Therefore, challenging is the best strategic move rather than risking a higher bid on an unlikely count.
