--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. My hand has no 6s, so the opponent must have all 5 required. With only 8 digits in their hand, having 5 6s is possible but risky. Challenging is a good option since their bid requires a high concentration of 6s, which might be a bluff.
