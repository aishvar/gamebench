Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Since the bid is very low, challenging it is risky because my opponent likely has at least one 0. I should make a safe, strictly higher bid based on my hand. I have two 9s and two 8s, so bidding 2 8s is a reasonable and safe increase that reflects my hand strength.

Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s and two 8s. The current bid is 2 9s, which I can fully account for myself, making it risky to challenge. Since I have two 8s, it's reasonable to assume there might be at least one more 8 in the opponent's hand, supporting a higher bid on 8s. To increase the bid, I can raise the quantity to 3 and select 8s, which is a natural and plausible escalation based on my strong holding.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 9s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s and two 8s. The current bid is 3 9s, which requires there to be at least one more 9 in Player 0's hand. Given that Player 0 previously increased the bid from 2 9s to 3 9s, it's plausible they have at least one 9. Since 3 9s is quite reasonable, challenging now is risky. To safely increase, I can bid 4 8s, as I already hold two 8s and would only need two more in Player 0's hand, which is within a plausible range.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
