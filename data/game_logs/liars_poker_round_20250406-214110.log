Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Since I'm the first to bid, I can start with a reasonable quantity. Bidding 3 8s is a moderate claim, considering there might be one more 8 in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which would require the other player to have two 8s as well. Considering the limited number of digits, this seems unlikely. Challenging the bid is a strategic move to test the validity of the claim.
