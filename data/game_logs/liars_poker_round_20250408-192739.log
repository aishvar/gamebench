Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I examined my hand 30477589 and noticed I hold two 7s, which is my strongest asset. With no current bid on the table, starting by leveraging my pair of 7s with a bid of '2 7s' places some pressure on my opponent while still keeping the bid conservative enough.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I can see my hand: 75060238. It contains one 7. So, in total, there are at least two 7s (one in my hand and at least one in the opponent's hand). I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Since the current bid is not extremely high and plausible, I will make a higher bid. I can bid 3 7s or 2 8s. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 30477589, so I have two 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, which means that for the bid to be valid the opponent must have at least one 7 in their 8 digits – roughly a 57% chance. If I raise the bid (for example to 4 7s or 3 8s) I’d then require the opponent to supply two additional matching digits, an event with only about an 18–19% chance of being true. Given that a challenge now wins if the opponent has no 7s (about a 43% chance) – a better probability than any safe bid I can offer – the best move is to challenge.
