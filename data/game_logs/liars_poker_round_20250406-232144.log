--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. My hand contains one 3, one 4, one 7, two 9s, one 8, one 6, and one 4. The most common digits in my hand are two 9s and two 4s. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I will start with 2 9s, as I already hold two and it is likely there could be more.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand. The opponent's bid of 2 9s requires them to have at least two 9s in their 8-digit hand. With 16 total digits (8 per player), the probability of the opponent holding exactly two 9s is ~15%, and ≥2 is ~18.6%. Since there's an ~81% chance they have fewer than two 9s, challenging is statistically favorable compared to making a risky bid like 3 8s (where success depends on opponent having ≥1 8).
