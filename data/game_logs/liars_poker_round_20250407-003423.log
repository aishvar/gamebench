--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, which is the highest frequency of any digit in my hand. Bidding 2 1s is a safe and reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is only 2 1s. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 8s. Since the maximum possible 8s in play is 2 (from my opponent's hand), it's highly unlikely there are 3 or more 8s. Challenging is the best move.
