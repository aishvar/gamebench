--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 8s, two 1s, one 4, and one 9. Starting with a conservative and statistically reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 8s because I hold two 8s myself, making it very likely true and a safe opening.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 8s. Bidding higher on 8s is risky without knowing the other player's digits. However, I can bid on a digit I have, such as 3 5s, as I have one 5 in my hand. This bid is higher than the current bid and leverages the digits I know I have.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 4, 8, 0, 1, 0, 8, 9, 1. I have zero 5s, so the current bid of 3 5s relies entirely on the opponent's hand containing at least three 5s, which is unlikely given they have only 8 digits. Statistically, it's improbable for one player to hold three or more of the same digit unless I also have some. Therefore, I believe the bid is an overstatement and challenging is the optimal move.
