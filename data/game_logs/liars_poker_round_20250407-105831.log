Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 3, one 7, one 9, two 8s, one 6, and one 2. The most frequent digit is 8, which appears twice. Opening with a conservative but solid bid based on my hand, I will bid 2 8s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 60379286, I have exactly one 9. The current bid is 2 9s, so for that to be true, the opponent must have at least one 9. Since it's quite plausible they have one or two 9s, challenging now is risky. Instead, I can raise the bid slightly. I also have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s is a safe, valid higher bid (since it increases the quantity and 3 > 2).
