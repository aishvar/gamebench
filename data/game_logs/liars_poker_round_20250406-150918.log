Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand 60798319, I have two 9s, two 0s, two 3s, and two 1s. A safe opening bid is usually 2 of a digit I have multiples of. I'll start with 2 9s, as I hold two 9s myself, making this bid credible and forcing the opponent to either raise or challenge a likely true statement.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 6 and no 9s in my hand. The quantity of 9s is likely to be low since I don't have any. Bidding 2 8s is not higher than 2 9s because the digit is lower. I can either challenge or make a higher bid by increasing the quantity. Since I don't have any 9s, I think 2 9s might be a bit high, but I should be cautious. I will increase the quantity to make a higher bid. Bidding 3 0s seems reasonable as it's a higher quantity and I have some information about my digits.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 60798319, I have one 0. The current bid is 3 0s, implying at least two more zeros in Player 1's hand. Since zeros are relatively rare and I only have one, it's somewhat unlikely Player 1 has two or more zeros. However, it's plausible, so challenging now might be risky. Instead, I can make a safe higher bid based on my strong count of 9s; I have three 9s. The initial bid was 2 9s, so increasing to 3 9s is a legal and reasonable next bid, matching the current quantity but with a higher digit than 0s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (from 56106728), so there are 7 other digits. The probability of having more 9s is low. However, I can still make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about other digits in my opponent's hand, I'll play it safe and increase the digit. The next higher digit is not feasible as it's 9, so I'll increase the quantity instead. Bidding 4 0s is a reasonable move as it increases the quantity and changes the digit to the lowest possible, making it more plausible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '60798319', I have one 0. The current bid is 4 zeros, which would require my opponent to hold at least 3 zeros. Given 8 digits per player, the expected average for any digit is around 1.6. Having 4 zeros total is plausible but already on the high side. Since I only have one zero, it's unlikely my opponent has 3 or more. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
