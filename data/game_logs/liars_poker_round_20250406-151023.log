Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one '2', one '1', one '7', one '6', one '4', one '3', one '5', and one '5' again, so two 5s. A conservative and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, reflecting my own hand strength and leaving room to maneuver.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have one 5 in my hand (since my digits are 86030897). It's possible that there's at least one more 5 in the opponent's hand, making the total count of 5s at least 2. However, I also notice that I have a good number of other digits. I have two 8s and other scattered digits. I can bid higher on a digit that I have more of. I have two 8s, so bidding on 8s seems reasonable. Bidding 3 8s is a valid move as it is higher than 2 5s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (52176435), I have zero 8s. Since there are 16 digits total and I hold half of them, the other player would need to have at least 3 8s alone to make their bid valid. The probability of one player having 3 or more of a specific digit is quite low. Given this, the bid of 3 8s seems unlikely to be valid, so the best move is to challenge.
