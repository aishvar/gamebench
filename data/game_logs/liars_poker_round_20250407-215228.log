Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 50800616, I notice I have three 0s, two 6s, one 5, one 1, and one 8. Starting with a conservative but strong opening bid, I will focus on the digit I have most of, which is 0 with three instances. Given there are 16 digits total, it's reasonable to assume there are at least 4 zeros combined. Therefore, I will open with a bid of 4 zeros.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 93642147. I have zero '0's. The current bid is '4 0s', made by Player 0. For this bid to be true, Player 0 must have at least four '0's in their 8-digit hand, as there are only 16 digits in total (8 per player). The statistical expectation for the number of '0's in Player 0's hand is 8 * (1/10) = 0.8. Requiring four '0's when the expectation is less than one, and I possess none, makes the bid highly suspect. Challenging seems statistically advantageous compared to making a higher bid, such as '4 1s' (requiring 3 ones from the opponent) or '4 4s' (requiring 2 fours from the opponent), which are also somewhat unlikely but less so than '4 0s'.
