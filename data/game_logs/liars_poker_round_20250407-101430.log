Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid of 2 9s is safe because the total 9s across all players must be at least 2 (my own two 9s). This forces the opponent to either bid higher or risk losing by challenging a guaranteed valid bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand. For the bid to be true, the opponent must have at least two 9s. While possible, challenging such a low bid early is risky. I have two 1s in my hand (51126874). Bidding 3 1s is a safe and logical next step. It increases the quantity and leverages the strength of my hand (having two 1s). This bid only requires the opponent to have one 1 for it to be true, which is statistically plausible.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 1s in my hand. The opponent's bid of 3 1s requires them to have at least three 1s in their 8-card hand. Given the low probability of holding three 1s in an 8-digit hand (approximately 3.3% chance for exactly three) and the risk of overcommitting with a new bid, challenging is statistically favorable here.
