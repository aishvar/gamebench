Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Since this is the first bid, I can start with a reasonable quantity. Bidding 3 6s gives me a good chance of being correct while allowing room for the opponent to challenge or increase the bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 2, one 5, one 3, one 4, one 7, one 9, one 1, and one 2 in my hand. I don't have any 6s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have any 6s, I'm inclined to think that the total count of 6s might be low, but I should still consider the possibility that the other player has some. I will bid 3 7s, increasing the digit to make a higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand, and the maximum possible count is two if Player 1 has one. Challenging seems likely to succeed as the bid is probably a bluff.
