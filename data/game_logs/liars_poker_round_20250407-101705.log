Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 zero is plausible but not overly strong. I do have two 5s and two 8s, so increasing the bid to 2 5s or 2 8s would be safe and strategic. Since I want to make a strictly higher bid, increasing the quantity to 2 and choosing a digit I hold multiple times is a solid move. I will bid 2 5s, which is likely to be valid given my hand and possible distribution in the opponent's hand.
