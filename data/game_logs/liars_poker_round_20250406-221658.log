Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make a valid initial bid. I have two 2s, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 1, and one 9 in my hand. A reasonable starting bid could be '2 2s' since I have two of that digit, which is a solid foundation for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid of 2 2s places the entire burden on the opponent, and I have no 2s in my hand. With only 8 unknown digits on the opponent's side, the probability of them having two 2s is roughly 19%, making it highly unlikely that the bid is valid. Thus, challenging the bid is the statistically optimal move.
