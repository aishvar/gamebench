Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must open the bidding. A good opening bid targets a digit I have multiple of, to ensure a safe and credible start. In my hand, I have two 5s, two 4s, and one each of 7, 8, 9, and 6. The best opening bid is '2 5s' because I hold two 5s, making it likely that at least two 5s exist in total, and possibly more in the opponent's hand. This is a safe and strategic initial bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I need to assess my hand to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. My hand is 11942267. I count the occurrences of '5' in my hand, which is 0. The total count of '5's across both hands must be at least the count in my hand (0) plus the count in Player 0's hand. Since Player 0 bid 2 5s, it's possible they have some '5's. I should consider if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more appropriate. A higher bid can be made by either increasing the quantity or bidding on a higher digit. The next higher digit is '6' or more, and I see I have one '6' and two '2's. However, bidding on '6's or higher might be too aggressive without knowing Player 0's hand. I can bid higher on '5's if I believe there's a good chance there are more than 2 '5's in total. Given I have 0 '5's, if Player 0 has 2 '5's, the total is exactly 2. I should consider if it's likely Player 0 has more '5's or if there's another digit I can bid on. Since I have a total of 4 '2's, I can consider bidding on '2's. The current bid is 2 5s, so bidding 4 2s would be a valid higher bid because 4 is greater than 2. Thus, making a higher bid is a viable action.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (55847496), I have no 2s. Since there are 8 digits in my opponent's hand, the bid of 4 2s requires that opponent to have at least 4 twos, given I have zero. Having 4 or more of the same digit in 8 digits is quite unlikely (roughly 5% chance or less). The previous bid was 2 5s, and I have two 5s, so that was reasonable. Given the low probability that my opponent holds 4 or more 2s, I believe the current bid is an overbid and should be challenged.
