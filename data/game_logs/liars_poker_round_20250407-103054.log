Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) making initial bid: 1 0s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 1 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible. Since I need to make a strictly higher bid, the minimal increment would be to bid 1 1s, 1 2s, ..., or 2 0s. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 0s, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 6. The safest reasonable raise is to 2 7s since I already hold two 7s, making that bid guaranteed true for my own hand alone.

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 2 8s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 7, 0, 1, 2, 7, 3, 4, 6. I have zero 8s. The current bid is 2 8s, meaning there must be at least two 8s across both hands. Since I have none, Player 0 must have at least two 8s for the bid to be valid. The probability of having two or more 8s in Player 0's hand of 8 digits is relatively low (~14%), making the bid unlikely. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (Naive 50/50) bid of 2 8s.
