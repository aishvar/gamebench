Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I can set a reasonable opening bid. Looking at my hand (1, 6, 2, 5, 8, 8, 1, 0), I have two 8s, which ensures that at least two 8s are in play. Bidding '2 8s' is a safe and plausible opening, and it leaves room for further increases by both players.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand and the current bid is 3 8s. That bid requires that the opponent holds at least one 8 among their 8 unknown digits – a roughly 57% chance. If I were to raise the bid to 4 8s (or switch to another digit), I’d be claiming that there are at least four 8s in total. Since I already have two, the opponent would need to supply at least two 8s—a chance of only about 19%. In comparison, challenging the current bid wins if the opponent has no 8s (about a 43% probability), which, although not ideal, is significantly better than relying on a highly unlikely bid. Therefore, based on my hand and the probabilities involved, I choose to challenge the current bid.
