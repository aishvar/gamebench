Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely there are at least three 5s in total across both players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid since 9 is higher than 5. I have two 9s in my hand, so there's a chance the opponent has at least one 9 to meet the bid. This avoids increasing the quantity, which might be riskier given my limited counts.

Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have two 5s in my hand, but no 9s. Bidding 4 5s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and it's likely that the other player has at least one 5, making this a plausible bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. To challenge, the total count must be <4. Since my opponent has 8 digits, having 4 5s is possible but risky. Given my hand's lack of 5s, challenging is a calculated risk to exploit their potential bluff.
