Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without worrying about being too high. I have two 6s and two 5s. A bid of 2 5s or 2 6s seems reasonable and not easily challengeable given the total number of digits in play.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have 2 5s in my hand, but I also have a 6 and a 1. I can increase the quantity or the digit in my bid. Since I have a 6, I will increase the digit to 6, making my bid 3 6s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, and I know that Player 1 (llama-3.1-8b-instruct) has not shown their hand yet. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and there are only 8 secret digits per player, I should consider the possibility of higher digits or quantities. Since my hand contains two 6s, and I do not know the exact distribution of digits in Player 1's hand, I should consider a bid that seems reasonable but also challenging. The current bid is 3 6s, so I should either increase the quantity or the digit. I have a 6 in my hand, so bidding higher on 6s or switching to a higher digit seems reasonable. However, bidding 4 6s seems risky without knowing Player 1's hand. I will increase the quantity and bid on a digit I have in my hand.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 5 6s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, and the bid history shows increasing confidence in the digit 6. My hand also contains a 7 and other digits, but no more 6s than the current bid suggests. I should bid higher than 5 6s if possible or challenge if unlikely. Since I have two 6s and the bid is 5 6s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I have no 7s or 8s or 9s, but I do have two 6s. Increasing the quantity seems risky without more information, but I can try to increase the digit or quantity cautiously.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 7S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have a 7 in my hand, which is a good sign. I also have a 6, which is the digit from the previous bids. Considering the bid history and my hand, I can confidently make a higher bid with a higher quantity and digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 7 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 8s. Given that I have a hand with digits 0, 0, 9, 9, 5, 7, 3, 7, I should assess the likelihood of there being 7 or more 8s in total. Since there are only 16 digits in total and my hand does not contain any 8s, I find it highly unlikely that there are 7 or more 8s. I should challenge this bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
