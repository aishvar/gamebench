Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 1s and two 2s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. Starting with a bid of 2 2s is a safe initial move.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 2 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 2s, making it unlikely that there are significantly more than two 2s in total. However, the current bid of 2 2s is quite conservative and plausible, so challenging now would be risky. To stay in the game strategically, I will make a minimal higher bid by keeping the quantity at 2 but raising the digit to 3s, which is a safe incremental increase given I have one 3 in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 3S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 3s. Since the bid is already at 2, and I only have one, it's possible the opponent has at least one more 3. However, to be safe and increase the bid, I can bid a higher digit that I have more of. I have two 2s and two 1s in my hand. Bidding 3 2s increases the quantity and uses a digit I have more of.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 2S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 2s and one 3. The current bid is 3 2s, which I cannot support from my hand. Since I have no 2s, the likelihood that the opponent has all three 2s is relatively low, though not impossible. To outbid, I could bid 3 3s, and since I have one 3, it would only require the opponent to have two 3s, which is equally plausible. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to 4 of another digit I have many of. I notice I have three 6s and two 4s and two 3s. Bidding 4 6s may be risky since I only have three, requiring the opponent to have at least one. Bidding 3 3s is safer and a minimal increment. Therefore, I will bid 3 3s, raising the digit while keeping the quantity the same.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 3S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s, which means there needs to be at least two more 3s in the opponent's hand. Given that the opponent has already bid 2 3s and then increased to 3 3s, it's possible they have at least two 3s. However, bidding higher would require either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since increasing the quantity to 4 seems risky without more information, I can increase the digit to 4 or higher. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 3 6s is a safe move that increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s (digits: 6, 4, 8, 5, 4, 3, 3, 6). The current bid is 3 6s, which requires at least one more 6 in Player 0's hand. Given that distribution, it's quite plausible Player 0 has at least one 6, making the bid reasonable. To stay in the game, I can safely raise the bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving to 3 7s, since that is a minimal safe increment.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which means the opponent would need at least two more 7s in their hand. Given the bid history, the opponent has been increasing the digit but not the quantity. It's possible they have some 7s, but bidding 3 7s seems risky. I should challenge this bid to see if they are bluffing.
