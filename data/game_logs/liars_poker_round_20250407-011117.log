Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I must start with a bid. My hand has two 8s. Bidding 3 8s assumes the opponent has at least one 8, which is plausible. Starting with a mid-range bid leaves room for others to raise while leveraging my existing 8s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 8s at all. The current bid is 3 8s, which requires at least three 8s across both hands. Since I hold zero 8s, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have all three or more 8s, which is statistically unlikely with only eight digits. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
