Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. Since I'm the first to bid, I'll start with a moderate bid of 3 4s, considering the possibility that the opponent might have one more 4.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. I have one 6. Bidding 4 4s would be a reasonable increase, but I'm hesitant as I have no 4s. Bidding 3 5s is also possible, but I'd rather increase the digit. Therefore, I will bid 3 5s, which is a valid increase in digit while keeping the quantity the same. It is a reasonable bid given my hand and the current state of the game.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand, making the total possible count of 5s between 1 and 9 (if all of Player 1's digits are 5s). However, it's unlikely that Player 1 has two additional 5s to make the total three. Challenging this bid seems reasonable given the low likelihood of the total count meeting the bid.
