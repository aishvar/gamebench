Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game, and there is no current bid to challenge or beat. I have two 8s in my hand, which is a strong starting point. Bidding 4 8s seems reasonable, as it increases both quantity and digit based on my hand, and it's a plausible bid given the total number of digits in play.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, so the total number of 8s must come from Player 0's hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which would require Player 0 to have all 4. This is possible but unlikely. Challenging is a good move because if the total is less than 4, I win.
