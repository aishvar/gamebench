Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game, and I need to make a strategic opening move. Looking at my hand (05889343), I have two 8s and two 3s, with single occurrences of 0, 5, 9, and 4. Since I have two 8s in my hand, there are at least 2 eights in the game. Making a conservative bid based on what I know for certain is a good starting strategy. I'll bid '2 8s' since I can verify this from my hand alone, and it gives me room to observe my opponent's bidding patterns before making more aggressive moves.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. Since the current bid is 2 8s, it's quite plausible there is at least one more 8 in the opponent's hand, making the bid reasonable. To outbid, I can either bid 3 8s or 2 9s. Given that I have no 9s in my hand, bidding 2 9s would be risky. However, bidding 3 8s is a safer incremental bid, as having at least three 8s in total is plausible based on my one 8 and the possibility of the opponent holding two. Therefore, I will raise to 3 8s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand (05889343). The current bid is '3 8s', which means my opponent is claiming there are at least 3 eights total between our hands. Since I already have 2 eights, this means they're claiming to have at least 1 eight in their hand, which is quite reasonable. I could bid higher, either by increasing the quantity (to 4 8s) or by keeping the quantity at 3 but increasing the digit (to 3 9s). Looking at my hand, I have one 9, so bidding '3 9s' would mean my opponent needs to have at least 2 nines, which is possible but less likely than them having 1 eight. I also have one 4 and one 3, so I could bid '4 3s' or '4 4s', but that would require my opponent to have at least 3 of those digits. I think the safest play is to bid '3 9s', keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s, making it unlikely there are 3 or more 9s across both hands, since my opponent would need to hold all three. Given 8 digits per player, the probability of one player having 3 or more 9s is quite low. Therefore, challenging the bid is the most strategic move.
