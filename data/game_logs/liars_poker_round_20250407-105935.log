Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have four 9s in my hand. The current bid is None. Since I have a strong hand for digit 9, I should make a bid to set the bar high.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 71658253, I have two 6s and two 5s, but no 9s. I can see if I can make a reasonable bid based on my hand. I have two 5s and two 6s. Bidding 5 5s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and digit compared to 4 9s, but I should verify if it's strictly higher and feasible.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have two 5s in my hand. I should make a bid that increases the quantity or digit. I have a 6 in my hand, so I'll bid 6 6s, increasing the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more likely to succeed. My hand contains one 6, so I know there are at least 4 sixes in total (since Player 0 bid 4 9s and I bid 5 5s). Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and there are only 8 digits per player, I should consider if there's a higher digit or quantity I can bid on. Since my hand has a 6, and I know there are at least 4 sixes, I should think about bidding higher or challenging.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s, and I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 8 6s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 8 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains 2 sixes, which could potentially contribute to a higher count of 6s, but I also need to think about the total count of digits across both players' hands. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and given that the current bid is already at 8, I should consider if there's a high likelihood that there are indeed at least 8 sixes in total. If not, I might have a chance to challenge. However, I see that I have two 6s and my opponent has already bid high quantities of 6s. I need a strategy that considers my hand and the likelihood of my opponent's hand. Given that I have two 6s and the bid is 8 6s, I should think about bidding higher or challenging. I have a 5 and a 6 in my hand, and several other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid or a challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 9 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 6s. Considering my hand, I have one 6. I should bid higher quantity or same quantity but higher digit. Since I have no higher digit than 6, I will increase the quantity to 10 6s. This is a reasonable move, given my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 10 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 6s. Given that I have one 6 in my hand and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I need to assess if I can reasonably make a higher bid or if challenging is more appropriate. Since I have one 6, and the bid history shows increasing quantities but not necessarily a focus on 6s, I should consider if I can safely bid higher or if there's a better chance of challenging.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 11 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 11 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 11 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 12 6s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 12 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 12 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 12 6s. Given that I have one 6 in my hand and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I must assess if I can reasonably make a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent. Since I do not have enough information about Player 0's hand and my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I need to consider what I can safely bid without overestimating. The current bid is quite high at 12 6s, but I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I have a 6 in my hand, so bidding higher on 6s or switching to another digit is an option. However, without exact counts of other digits, I must make an educated guess. Given my hand does not have an abundance of high digits, I will increase the quantity slightly and choose a digit that I have in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 13 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 13 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 13 6s. Given the current bid and my hand, I should make a bid that is higher in quantity. I can bid 14 6s, which is a reasonable increase given the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 14 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 14 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 14 6s. Given that I have one 6 in my hand and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I should consider if there's a high likelihood that there are indeed 14 or more 6s in total. Since I have no information about Player 0's hand but know that the bid has been increasing steadily for 6s, I should evaluate if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. My hand contains one 6, and I know there are at least 14 6s if the bid is correct so far. I should challenge this bid as it seems highly unlikely that there are 14 or more 6s in total, given that we only have 16 digits in play (8 from each player).
