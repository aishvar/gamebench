Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, two 7s, two 0s, one 5, one 9, and one 6. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will choose '2 7s' because I have two 7s myself, making it quite likely there are at least two 7s in total.

Player 1 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 4, 7, 5, 9, 6, 4, 0, 7. I have zero 8s. Since the current bid is 2 8s, for that bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least two 8s in their hand of 8 digits. The probability of having two or more 8s in 8 digits is relatively low (~23%), especially since I hold none. Given this low likelihood, challenging is statistically favorable.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
