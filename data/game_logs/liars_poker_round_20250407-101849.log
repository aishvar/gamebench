Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Since the bid is very low, challenging now is risky because my opponent could easily have a 0 in their hand. It's strategically better to make a minimal but higher bid, increasing either the digit or quantity. I will raise the digit to 1s, keeping the quantity the same, which is the smallest legal increase.
