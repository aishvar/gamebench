Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning I can make any initial bid I want. I should look for the highest digit in my hand and bid a reasonable quantity based on that. My hand is 97918725, so I have two 7s and two 9s. Bidding 2 9s seems like a strong initial bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, making it plausible that there are at least two 9s in total. However, since I must either bid higher or challenge, I will increase the bid. Given my hand, I also have two 6s, which makes bidding 3 6s a reasonable choice. This increases both the quantity and changes the digit, staying within plausible limits.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, making the total count of 6s at least 2. Given that the bid is 3 6s, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains a 7, 8, and 9, and several other digits, I should consider bidding higher. The bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 6s'. I can see that bidding 4 7s would be a reasonable move as it increases both the quantity and the digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand, and it is plausible that Player 0 has three or more 7s, but not guaranteed. To avoid challenging prematurely, I can safely make a higher bid. I also have two 6s in my hand, so I will increase the quantity to 5 and bid on 6s, as it is a reasonable and valid progression from the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 7s, and I see an opportunity to increase the quantity while also increasing the digit. Since the last bid was 5 6s, I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I have two 7s, so bidding 6 7s seems reasonable and higher than the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. In my hand, I have one 7. For Player 0 to bid 6 7s, they likely have multiple 7s, but it is still unlikely that there are 6 or more 7s across both hands. Given the bid history, Player 0 has been incrementally increasing bids on 7s, which suggests they may be bluffing or overestimating the total count. Since the maximum total count of any digit is 16, and I only see one 7 in my hand, I believe it is improbable that there are 6 7s in total. Therefore, I should challenge this bid.
