Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. Since this is the first bid, I choose a moderate quantity to start with. Bidding 2 7s seems reasonable, as it's a higher digit and a manageable quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 42129805, which contains one 7 and no 8s or 9s. I can bid higher on 7s or bid on a higher digit. Bidding 3 7s is a reasonable move as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, bidding 2 8s is also valid as it keeps the same quantity but increases the digit. Given that I have no 8s, bidding 2 8s seems risky. Thus, bidding 3 7s is a safer choice.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. To reach a total of three 7s, the other player would need at least two 7s. Considering the uncertainty and the risk involved, challenging the bid seems like a strategic move to test the validity of the claim.
