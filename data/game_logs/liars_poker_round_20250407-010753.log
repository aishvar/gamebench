Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. My hand is 10625536. I have two 5s and two 6s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. The total number of digits is 16 (2 players * 8 digits). The expected frequency of any digit is 1.6. Having two 6s makes it plausible that there are at least three 6s in total across both hands (assuming the opponent has at least one 6). Bidding '3 6s' is a reasonable opening bid based on my hand, using one of my most frequent digits and setting a non-trivial starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s and one 7 in my hand, which gives me a strong possibility of there being more than 3 6s in total. Since the current bid is 3 6s, I can raise it by bidding 4 7s, which increases the quantity while also changing the digit to a higher one. This seems reasonable given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have zero 7s in my hand (10625536). For the bid to be accurate, the opponent (Player 1) must have at least four 7s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, requiring half of the opponent's hand to be a specific digit seems relatively unlikely, especially since the expected number of any digit in an 8-digit hand is less than one (0.8). Bidding higher, for example 5 5s or 5 6s (based on my two 5s and two 6s), would require the opponent to hold at least three of that digit, which is also uncertain. Given the specific requirement for the opponent to hold four 7s for the current bid to stand, challenging appears to be the statistically safer and more logical move.
