Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have three 6s and two 3s. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it's based on the information I have about my own hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, so the other player would need all three 6s themselves, which is unlikely. Statistically, having three or more of a single digit out of just eight random digits is improbable. I will challenge the bid.
