Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so any valid bid is acceptable. I have two 0s, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 8, and two 9s. A conservative but valid bid would be 1 0s. However, I can be a bit more aggressive. Bidding 2 0s seems reasonable given I have two 0s in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 9, 8, 5, 3, 7, 2, 9, 5. I have zero 0s, making it unlikely there are many 0s overall. The current bid is 2 0s, which is plausible since the opponent might have two 0s. Instead of challenging early on a reasonable bid, I will increase the bid to a more probable digit based on my hand. I notice I have two 9s, so bidding 3 9s is a reasonable escalation, as it's likely there is at least one more 9 in the opponent's hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 4 9s would be a reasonable bluff, as it's a small increase and might be believable. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 0, 3, or 5. Since the previous bid was 2 0s, bidding 3 0s is a logical next step and doesn't reveal much about my hand. Bidding 4 0s might be too aggressive. Considering I have two 0s, I'll bid 3 0s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 4 9s would be a reasonable increase, as it's a higher quantity of the same digit. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have two 0s, so bidding 3 0s is also a valid option, but it doesn't leverage any new information about the opponent's hand. I also have two 3s. Bidding 4 3s is also possible. Given that the previous bid was 2 0s, and I have two 0s, a challenge on the 3 9s seems unlikely to succeed. Therefore, increasing the bid on 9s seems most logical.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s. The current bid is 4 9s, meaning there would need to be at least two additional 9s in Player 0's hand. Given that four 9s among 16 digits is plausible, but five or more starts to get unlikely, I don't feel confident raising the quantity. However, bidding 4 9s has already been made, so the next valid bid must be at least 5 of any digit or 4 of a digit higher than 9, which is impossible since digits go only up to 9. Therefore, the only valid bids are 5 of any digit. I only have two 9s and one 5, so bidding 5 9s or 5 of any other digit is risky. The current bid of 4 9s is plausible but marginal. I suspect Player 0 may be bluffing, so the best move is to challenge.
