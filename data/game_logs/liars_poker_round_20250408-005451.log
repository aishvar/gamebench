Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 26199627. I count the digits: 2 appears once, 6 once, 1 once, 9 twice, 6 twice, 2 once, 7 once. The most frequent digit in my hand is 6 (2 times) and 9 (2 times). A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and consider the total count across both players. Assuming the other player might have a similar distribution, bidding on the most frequent digit I see (9 or 6) with a quantity of at least 3 (considering both my count and a potential count from the other player) is a good strategy. I choose to bid on 9s with a quantity of 3.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. For the current bid of 3 9s to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least two 9s. This is plausible, but uncertain. Making a minimal higher bid would be safe to avoid challenging too early. The next valid bid would be 3 9s -> 4 0s (increasing quantity) or 3 9s -> 3 9s with a higher digit, but since 9 is the highest digit, only increasing quantity is valid. Given the uncertainty, I will bid 4 4s because I have one 4, making it a plausible incremental bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. My hand is 26199627, which contains two 6s and no 4s or 9s. The previous bid was 3 9s, and now Player 1 has bid 4 4s, increasing the quantity but decreasing the digit. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep it the same and increase the digit. Since I have no 4s, I doubt the total count of 4s is 4 or more across both hands. However, I can bid on a higher digit. I will bid 4 5s, keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit.

Player 0 bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 9, 0, 8, 4, 1, 7, 6, 4. I have no 5s at all. Since the bid is 4 5s, all four or more 5s would have to be in Player 0's hand. The probability of one player holding four or more of a specific digit in 8 digits is quite low. Given that I have zero 5s, it's unlikely the total count is 4 or more. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
