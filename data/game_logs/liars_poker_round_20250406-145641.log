Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening bid and I have two 5s and two 1s in my hand, a conservative yet reasonable starting bid would be 3 5s, as it's likely there are at least three 5s among all 24 digits, considering I already hold two.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 3 fives in total across all players' hands. Given that I have one 5 in my hand, and there are 8 secret digits per player, I should consider the probability of there being at least 3 fives in total. However, without knowing the exact distribution of digits in other players' hands, I must make an educated guess. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should look for a digit and quantity that seems plausible but also puts pressure on the other players. I have one 5 and other digits that could potentially be high or low. A slightly higher bid seems reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are four 6s in total across all hands. Challenging seems like the best move.
