--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I must start with a bid. My hand has two 7s. Bidding 3 7s sets a moderate initial claim, leveraging my existing 7s while leaving room for others to raise. The bid is plausible since the opponent could have one 7, and the higher digit (7) gives a strategic advantage in future bids.

Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 7s. Since I hold 8 digits and none are 7s, all 7s must come from Player 0's hand. For the current bid of 3 7s to be true, Player 0 would need to have at least 3 of them in their 8 digits. While possible, having 3 or more of the same digit in 8 cards is relatively uncommon. Given this, it's unlikely there are 3 or more 7s total, so challenging is the best move.
