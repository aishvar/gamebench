Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s and one 7 in my hand. Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make a valid bid. I can start with a reasonable bid of 2 6s, which reflects my hand and sets a baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6. Since the current bid is 2 6s, it is plausible my opponent has at least one 6, making the bid reasonable. To avoid an early challenge with little evidence, I will increase the bid minimally by keeping the quantity the same but raising the digit to 7, resulting in a higher bid of 2 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 and two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s, which I can easily meet or exceed. I can bid 3 7s to increase the quantity while keeping the digit the same, which is a reasonable move given my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one 7. The current bid is 3 7s, which would require at least two 7s in the opponent's hand to be valid. Since 7 is a relatively rare digit and I only have one, it's unlikely the opponent has two or more 7s. Therefore, challenging is the best strategic move.
