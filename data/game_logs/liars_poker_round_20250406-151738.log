--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, two 1s, two 7s, one 0, one 3, and one 9. A safe opening bid is typically 2 of a digit I have multiple of. I will start with '2 6s' based on my two 6s, which is a reasonable and defensible opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I can see that I have one 5 and no 6s in my hand: 54950235. The presence of a 5 and absence of 6s slightly suggests that the bid of 2 6s might be a bit aggressive, but it's still plausible given that there are 8 digits I can't see. I need to either challenge or make a higher bid. Since I have information about my own hand and the current bid is relatively low (2 6s), I'll consider making a bid that is higher. Bidding 3 6s increases the quantity and seems like a reasonable next step given the information I have. I could also consider bidding 2 7s, but given that I have a 5 and a 9 and no 7s, increasing the quantity might be safer.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which means there must be at least one 6 in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution, it's quite plausible the opponent has at least one 6. Making a conservative higher bid is safer than challenging. I will increase the quantity to 4 6s, leveraging my strong count of 6s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 5 and no 6s in my hand. The total count of 6s across both hands is at least one (from Player 0's hand) and at most 8 (if all of Player 0's digits were 6s), but it's highly unlikely that Player 0 has more than 4 6s. However, I can bid higher by increasing the digit. I will bid 4 7s, as it's a valid higher bid and seems reasonable given the circumstances.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (61067391), I have one 7. The current bid is 4 7s, so there must be at least three more 7s in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. Given the average expected count of any digit across 16 digits is about 1.6, four 7s total is plausible but somewhat aggressive. Since I only have one 7, and Player 1 would need to have three or more 7s, which is unlikely, challenging this bid is strategically sound.
