Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 7, 1, 6, 9, 5, 0, 7, 8. I have one '0' myself. The current bid is 1 0s, which is quite low and easily believable since I already have one. To increase the bid, I can either bid 1 1s (same quantity, higher digit) or increase the quantity. I have one '7' and two '7's in total, so bidding 2 7s is reasonable. Alternatively, I have one '7' and one '8', so bidding 2 7s or 2 8s is safe. Since the bid must be strictly higher, bidding 2 0s is also plausible as I have one, and the opponent likely has at least one zero in 8 digits. I will choose to increase the quantity to 2 and keep the digit at zero, making it a safe and valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 1s, so the current bid of 2 1s relies entirely on the opponent having at least two 1s among their eight digits. Given that the expected count of any digit across both players is roughly 1.6 (16 digits divided equally among 10 digits), two 1s is plausible but not overly conservative. Since I have no 1s, raising the bid on 1s would be risky. However, I have two 0s in my hand, and the previous bid on 0s was 2 0s. To outbid the current 2 1s, I can bid 2 2s or 3 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 0s, and one each of 6, 1, 5, 8, and 9. With two 7s, a bid of 2 7s would only match quantity, but since the current bid is 2 1s, I can bid 2 2s, 2 3s, ..., or 3 0s. Since I have two 0s, it's reasonable to bid 3 0s, as the opponent likely has at least one 0, making it plausible. Therefore, raising to 3 0s is a safe and strategic move.
