Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. I have one 6, one 7, one 9, one 4, one 5, one 2, and two 1s in my hand, so it's reasonable to assume there are at least a few instances of any digit across both players' hands. Starting with a conservative bid like 2 1s makes sense, as I already have two 1s in my hand and it sets a low but safe starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have a 1 in my hand, and I know there are 16 digits in total. Given that the bid is quite low, I should consider the possibility of having a higher quantity of a higher digit. However, without knowing Player 0's hand, I must make an educated guess. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I can increase either the quantity or the digit. I have multiple high digits and low digits in my hand, but I will focus on making a reasonable bid that could be valid given the information.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. In my hand, I have one 2, which makes it somewhat plausible that there are at least three 2s across both hands. However, I can make a higher bid based on the digits I hold. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 4 7s increases the quantity and changes the digit, making it a valid and stronger bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than this. I have a few digits in my hand but not many 7s or higher digits. I can see if I can make a reasonable bid based on my hand and the current state of the game. My hand contains one 7, so I have some information to base my decision on.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have two 7s in my hand, meaning there need to be at least three more 7s in Player 1's hand to meet the bid. This is plausible but not guaranteed. To avoid risking a challenge now, I can make a higher bid. Since I have one 9 in my hand, bidding 5 9s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid and strategic move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than this. I have a few 9s in my hand, but I also need to consider the possibility of challenging if I think the bid is unlikely. My hand contains two 9s, which I can use to inform my decision. Bidding 6 0s seems reasonable as it's higher in quantity than 5 9s and there are many possible 0s in Player 0's hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have no 0s in my hand, which makes it less likely that there are at least 6 0s across both hands. The maximum possible total is 16 digits, and with my hand lacking any 0s, Player 1 would need to have all 6 or more 0s, which seems improbable. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
