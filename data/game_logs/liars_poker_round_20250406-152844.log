Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s and two 6s, which are strong starting digits. A conservative but solid opening bid would be 2 6s or 2 8s. To slightly pressure my opponent, I'll opt for 2 8s, leveraging the two 8s I already hold.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I can see my own hand: 26119479. I have one 8 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 8, it's plausible that there's at least one more 8 in the other player's hand, making a total of at least 2 8s possible. I'll increase the digit to make a higher bid. Bidding 2 9s is a valid move and seems reasonable given the information.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (64805826), I have zero 9s. The current bid is 2 9s, which implies at least two 9s across both hands. Since I have none, the opponent must have both 9s or be bluffing. The probability of all 9s being in one hand is relatively low (roughly (8 choose 2)*(1/10)^2 â‰ˆ 0.25), so it's quite possible the opponent is bluffing or overestimating. Therefore, challenging is a strong move here.
