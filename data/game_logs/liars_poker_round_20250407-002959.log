--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. In my hand, I have two 6s, two 9s, two 0s, one 2, one 8, and one 5. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 6s, reflecting my own hand. This sets a baseline without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s, which means there must be at least one more 6 in the other player's hand. Since I only have one 6, I cannot safely increase the quantity to 3 6s. However, I can increase the digit to a 7, as I have two 7s in my hand, making a bid of 3 7s reasonable and higher than the current bid.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 2, 6, 9, 5, 6, 9, 8, 0. I have no 7s, which makes it less likely that there are 3 or more 7s total between both hands. Since I don't hold any 7s, the opponent would need to have all 3 or more 7s themselves, which is improbable given only 8 digits. Therefore, it's a good opportunity to challenge the bid.
