Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there has been no bid yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand 38362976, the counts of each digit are: 3(2), 8(2), 6(2), 2(1), 9(1), 7(1). The most frequent digits in my hand are 3, 6, and 8, each appearing twice. Statistically, it's safe to start with a bid reflecting my hand's strong digits, assuming the opponent has at least one or two of these digits as well. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 3 of 3s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 5, 0, 9, 7, 9, 1, 4, 0. There are no 3s in my hand, so the opponent's bid of 3 3s means they must have at least three 3s in their hand. Since the maximum possible quantity is 16 (8 per player), it's still possible for the opponent to have three 3s, but it's a relatively high bid given that 3s are not particularly common digits. However, since I don't have any 3s, I can't be certain they are bluffing. A safer move would be to bid a higher quantity of a digit I have more of, such as 0s or 9s. I have two 0s, so a bid of 4 0s would be a reasonable next move, as it's higher in quantity than the current bid and likely safe given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 38362976, which contains zero 0s. The opponent has bid that there are at least four 0s in total across both hands. Since I have none, the opponent must have at least four 0s alone for the bid to be valid, which is statistically unlikely given only 8 digits. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
