Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first move of the game, so I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand (36931285), I have one '1', one '2', one '3', one '5', one '6', one '8', one '9', and no '0', '4', or '7'. Since I don't know my opponent's hand, I need to make an educated guess about the total distribution. For a strategic opening bid, I should choose a digit I have at least one of (so I know there's at least that many) but not too high to avoid being challenged immediately. A bid of '3 1s' seems reasonable - I have one '1' in my hand, and it's reasonable to expect my opponent might have at least two more '1's in their 8 digits. This is a conservative opening that leaves room for the bidding to develop.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains no 1s, so the current bid of 3 1s is entirely dependent on the opponent's hand. Given that the maximum possible 1s in the game is 16 (8 per player), a bid of 3 is relatively low. However, since I have no 1s, it's statistically unlikely that the opponent has exactly 3 1s in their hand (which would be required for the bid to be valid). Therefore, challenging the bid is the most strategic move.
