Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 25488057. I have two 8s and two 5s, which are the digits I hold the most. The total number of digits across both players is 16. The expected average count for any digit is 1.6 (16 digits / 10 possible digits). Since I hold two 8s, bidding '2 8' is a statistically reasonable opening bid. It reflects the strength of my hand for this digit without being overly aggressive. It's plausible that there are at least two 8s across all 16 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '8' in my hand (81546739). The current bid is '2 8s', which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least two '8s' across both hands. Since I only have one, Player 0 must have at least one '8' in their hand for the bid to be valid. Given that '8' is a relatively high digit and not extremely common, there's a reasonable chance Player 0 does not have an '8', making the bid potentially false. Therefore, challenging is a viable option.
