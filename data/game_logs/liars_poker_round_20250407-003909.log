Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 5s, two 8s, one each of 0,1,4,6. Since this is the opening bid, I want to start with something conservative but based on what I know. Two 5s in my hand makes '3 5s' a reasonable opening bid - there's a good chance the opponent has at least one more 5.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s, which means there must be at least two more 5s in Player 0's hand. Given that I only have one 5, I cannot confidently bid higher on 5s. However, I can bid on a different digit. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 01854856, I only have zero 6s. For the opponent's bid of '4 6s' to be true, they would need to have at least 4 sixes in their hand. While possible, this seems unlikely as it would require half of their digits to be 6s. Given I can see there are no 6s in my hand, and the probability of 4 or more 6s in 8 random digits is relatively low, challenging is the better option than making a higher bid.
