Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s and two 0s in my hand. I should start by bidding a reasonable number of a common digit to set the bar. Bidding 2 0s seems like a good starting point.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 2 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 65716145, I have a total of 3 sixes, 2 fives, 1 four, 1 one, and 1 zero, and 2 sevens and 1 eight and 1 nine and 1 three and 1 two. I can see that bidding 3 or more of a digit I have multiple of seems reasonable. I have 3 sixes which makes 3 6s a reasonable bid as it increases both quantity and digit compared to 2 0s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 0s, one 7, one 9, and two 8s in my hand. I can see the 6s in the current bid are likely to be from Player 1's hand. I can increase the quantity and digit of the bid to make a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 6, 5, 7, 1, 6, 4, 5, and 1. I see that I have two 6s and one 7. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 8 digits in each player's hand, the total count of 7s could potentially be high but I have no 7s. I should bid higher than 4 if possible, considering my digits. Since I have two 6s, bidding on 6s seems reasonable. The current bid is 4 7s, so I need to bid higher than 4 or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. I can bid 5 6s or higher, as I have two 6s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 5 6s. To make a higher bid, I should increase the quantity to 6 6s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Given that the bid history has been steadily increasing and considering my hand, I should assess the likelihood of there being 6 or more 6s in total. Since I only have one 6, I need to consider if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. The bid of 6 6s seems plausible given that there are 16 digits in play and my opponent could have multiple 6s. However, I should consider if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is more suitable.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. I should bid a higher quantity of 6s or a higher digit. Since I have a 7 in my hand, bidding 8 6s or 7 7s seems reasonable.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 8 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Given that the bid history has progressively increased the quantity of 6s, it's likely that Player 0 has at least one 6. However, bidding 9 6s seems too risky without more information. I should consider a higher digit or quantity carefully. Since I don't have many high digits, I should either bid conservatively or challenge. The bid of 8 6s seems plausible but I don't have enough information to safely increase the bid. However, I can try to challenge this bid as it seems high given the number of 6s already bid.
