Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s, which is a very low quantity. Given my hand contains 0s, I can confidently bid a higher quantity with a higher digit. I see two 0s in my hand, so bidding 2 0s seems a reasonable increase.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. My hand contains two 6s, but no 1s. I have a 0 in my hand. The previous bids were 1 0s and 2 0s. Given the current bid and my hand, bidding 2 0s seems like the best move, as it's a higher quantity of the same digit.
