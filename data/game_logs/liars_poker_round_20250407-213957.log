Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. The best opening bid typically targets a digit I have multiple of to increase its likelihood. My hand is 62553894, which contains two 5s, two 3s, two 8s, and one each of 2, 6, 9, and 4. Opening with '2 5s' is reasonable because I have two 5s, and it's likely the opponent has at least one 5, making '2 5s' a conservative and solid opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 5s'. To beat this bid, I need to bid at least '3 5s' or any higher quantity of a lower digit. However, since I only have one '5' in my hand, it's unlikely that the other player has exactly one '5'. Therefore, challenging the bid is a strategic move to potentially win the round if the other player is bluffing.
