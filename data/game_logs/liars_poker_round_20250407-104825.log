Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 4s, two 9s, one 0, one 1, and one 3. It's usually safe to open with a conservative bid based on digits I hold multiples of. I will open with '2 8s' since I hold two 8s myself, making it at least plausible, and a reasonable starting bid.
