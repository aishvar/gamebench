Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. Starting the bid at 4 2s assumes there's at least one more 2 among other players' hands, making the total plausible. This raises the bid higher than my own count to challenge others early.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have zero 2s in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 2s seems reasonable. I have two 8s, so bidding 5 8s is a plausible option, increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 4 3s, 4 4s, etc. Since I have two 8s, and 5 is not an unreasonable quantity, I will bid 5 8s.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have two 8s in my hand (08476161). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Increasing the quantity to 6 and keeping the digit as 8 seems reasonable because I know there are at least 2 eights (the ones in my hand), and it's likely others have them too. However, bidding 6 8s might be a bit high since it implies a total of 6 eights across all hands. An alternative is to bid on a higher digit with the same quantity (5). The next higher digit is 9, so bidding 5 9s is a possibility. Since I don't have any 9s, I'm somewhat skeptical about the existence of many 9s, but it's still within the realm of possibility. Given the current bid and my hand, I will choose to bid 5 9s, as it is a higher bid and keeps the quantity the same while increasing the digit.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 9s

--- Turn: Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 5 9s, meaning there must be at least five 9s among all 32 digits. Since I only hold one, the remaining three players (24 digits) would need to collectively have at least four more 9s. The expected count for any digit across 32 digits is about 3.2, so five 9s is already on the high side. Given that, and the fact that the previous bid increased from 5 8s to 5 9s (not increasing quantity, just digit), I think Player 2 might be bluffing or pushing the limits. It's unlikely there are five 9s total, so challenging is the best move.
