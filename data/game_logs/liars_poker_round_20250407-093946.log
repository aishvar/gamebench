Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand has two 5s. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid of 2 5s is safe because even if the opponent has none, the total count (2) meets the bid. This allows me to set a baseline and force the opponent to bid higher.

Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s, requiring at least one 5 from the opponent. While they might have one, there's a ~43% chance they have none (calculated via probability). Given the risk/reward and their possible bluff, challenging now offers a reasonable chance to win.
