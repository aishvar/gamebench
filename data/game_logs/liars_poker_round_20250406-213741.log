Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I can make an opening bid. I have four 2s in my hand. Bidding a small amount of 2s seems like a reasonable starting point. I will bid 3 2s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This move is strategic as it leverages my hand's strength in 8s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. Bidding 4 0s is a safe increase in quantity, and I have two 0s in my hand, making it slightly more plausible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s, and I have no 0s in my hand. Given that the maximum possible 0s is 8 (from Player 0's hand), 4 0s seems plausible but risky. However, considering the bid history and the likelihood, challenging might be the better option to test the validity of the bid.
