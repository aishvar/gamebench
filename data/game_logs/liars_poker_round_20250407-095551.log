Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid in the game. Looking at my hand (33290849), I have two 3s, one 2, one 9, one 0, one 8, one 4, and no other digits. Since I have two 3s, that's a good starting point. I could bid conservatively with '2 3s' since I know those exist just in my hand. However, since this is the first bid and there are 16 total digits in play (8 in my hand and 8 in my opponent's hand), I can reasonably assume there might be more 3s in my opponent's hand. A slightly more aggressive but still reasonable opening bid would be '3 3s', suggesting there's at least one more 3 in my opponent's hand. This is a balanced opening that isn't too aggressive but also isn't too conservative.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 3s in my hand. For the current bid of 3 3s to be valid, Player 0 must have at least three 3s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of holding three 3s in 8 random digits is low (~2.68% by binomial calculation). Given the low likelihood and my lack of 3s, challenging is statistically favorable.
