--- Turn: Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: With no bids on the table, I have the freedom to choose a bid that reflects the strengths in my hand. My hand '46753007' contains two 7s, which guarantees that at least two 7s are in play. Bidding '2 7s' is a safe opening move because it aligns with my confirmed count and is low enough to not overcommit, while still pressuring the opponent as the game develops.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 7s, which makes the current bid of 2 7s plausible but uncertain. Since I hold no 7s, all 7s would have to be in Player 0's hand, which is possible but slightly unlikely. Instead of challenging now, a safer strategy is to increase the bid with a digit I hold multiple of. I have two 4s and two 5s, so bidding 3 4s is a reasonable and natural escalation, as I already hold two 4s myself.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 4S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand shows only one 4, so for the bid of 3 4s to be valid the opponent must have at least 2 fours, which has an approximate probability of 18.7%. Bidding higher would force me to rely on other digits I possess with lower supporting counts. Given the low likelihood that there are actually 3 fours among 16 digits, challenging the bid is the best strategic move.
