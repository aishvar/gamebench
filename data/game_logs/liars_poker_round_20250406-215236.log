Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. The current bid is 4 0s, which means Player 1 is claiming there are at least four 0s total. Since I have some 0s, I can confidently bid higher. I can bid 5 0s, which is a valid higher bid based on the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 6 0s is a safe increase. Alternatively, I could bid 5 of a higher number, but I don't have a strong indication of how many of any other number there are.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have no 0s in my hand, and the maximum possible quantity of 0s among both hands is 16. Since the previous bids have all been for 0s and the current bid is already at 6, it seems unlikely that there are that many 0s in play. Therefore, I should challenge the last bid.
