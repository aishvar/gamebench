Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. The current bid is 1 0s, which is plausible given my single 0 and the possibility that the opponent might have another. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. I notice I have two 9s, which makes a bid of 2 9s quite safe. This is a strictly higher bid and leverages my strong holding of 9s.

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 0s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have only one 0 in my hand. For the opponent's bid of 3 0s to be valid, there would need to be at least two 0s in their hand, which is somewhat unlikely given the average distribution (each digit appears roughly 1.6 times per player). Since I only hold one 0, and the naive opponent escalated the bid from 1 to 3 0s quickly, it's probable they are bluffing or overestimating. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
