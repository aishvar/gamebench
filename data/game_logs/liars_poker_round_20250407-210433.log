Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have a full knowledge of my hand, I should start with a conservative bid that is likely to be valid but not too high. My hand contains the digits: 1, 3, 3, 9, 6, 4, 0, 6. The most frequent digit in my hand is 6 which appears twice. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit across both players' hands is 16 and I have no information about the other player's hand, bidding on a digit that appears at least twice in my hand seems reasonable. I will bid on the digit '6' with a quantity of '2'. However, the action format requires a specific digit and quantity which seems to be 'Q D', implying quantity and digit respectively.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (13396406), I see I have one 7 and other digits but no 7s are present in a quantity of 2 or more. The current bid is '2 7s' made by Player 1. Given that I don't have enough 7s to make a higher quantity bid, I should consider if I can make a valid higher bid by digit or if challenging is the best option. Since I have a 7, I can try to bid a higher digit that I know exists in my hand or challenge if I think it's unlikely. My hand contains one 7, and several other digits including multiple 6s are not present but 6 is lower than 7.

Player 0 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (13396406), I count 3 sixes and 1 seven. The current bid is '2 7s'. To make a valid higher bid, I must exceed either the quantity (2) or the digit (7). Since I have 3 sixes, I can bid higher on sixes. Bidding '3 6s' would exceed the current quantity of 2 and is a valid move.
