Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have a variety of digits in my hand, I can start with a conservative bid. I have one '6' in my hand, so bidding '1 6s' is a safe starting point.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) bids: 1 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 1 6s, which is guaranteed to be true since there are at least two 6s in total (my hand alone). Bidding 2 6s increases the quantity while maintaining the digit, leveraging my strong hand and ensuring the bid is valid regardless of the opponent's hand. This forces the opponent to either bid higher or challenge a demonstrably safe claim.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s, which means there must be at least one more 6 in the opponent's hand. Since the bid is still relatively low and I have one 6, it's reasonable to increase the bid slightly. I'll bid 3 6s to keep the pressure on.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) bids: 3 6s
