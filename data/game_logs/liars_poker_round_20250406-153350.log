Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 59319290. I count 1 zero, 1 one, 1 two, 1 three, 1 five, and 2 nines. I'll start by bidding on the most frequent digit in my hand, which is 9. I have 2 nines, so it's reasonable to bid on at least 3 nines in total across both hands.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, which would require my opponent to be holding at least 3 or more 9s, or a combination where I have zero and they have all 3. Given that distribution, it's somewhat unlikely but still plausible. Since I have two 3s and two 4s, I can make a safe higher bid by increasing the digit but maintaining the quantity. Bidding 3 9s -> 3 9s is invalid, but bidding 3 9s -> 3 anything higher than 9 is impossible. So, I need to increase the quantity. I don't have any 9s but I do have two 3s, so bidding 4 3s is reasonable, as I expect at least two in their hand or a total of four combined.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have one 3, bidding 5 3s seems plausible because it increases the quantity. However, I should also consider the likelihood of the other player having multiple 3s. Given that I have one 3, it's reasonable to believe the total count could be higher. I'll bid 5 3s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 3S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have only one 3. The current bid is 5 3s, which means there must be at least five 3s across both hands. Since I only have one, the opponent would need at least four 3s for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution of digits, it's unlikely the opponent has four or more 3s out of eight digits. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
