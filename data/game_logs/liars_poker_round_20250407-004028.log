Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains two 7s, two 8s, and one 9, and one 0. A reasonable starting bid, given my hand and aiming to increase the quantity or digit in subsequent turns, would be to bid on a digit that appears multiple times in my hand. I have two 7s and two 8s, making 2 7s or 2 8s a safe starting point. I choose to bid 2 7s as my starting bid, increasing the quantity or digit in future turns.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 7s. Since I only have one 7, the total count of 7s across both hands is likely to be at least 2, but I cannot be certain without knowing the other player's hand. However, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity to 3 7s, as it is a reasonable assumption that there might be at least one more 7 in the other player's hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains two 7s, I can confidently bid higher. Increasing the quantity to 4 or more is risky without knowing the opponent's hand, but bidding 4 7s or higher seems unreasonable given my current knowledge. I can bid 3 8s, increasing the digit while matching the quantity, which seems like a reasonable next step.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 8s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total, it's unlikely that there are 3 or more 8s in play. I should challenge the bid to verify the count.
