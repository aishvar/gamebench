Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the opening bid and I have two 1s, two 9s, and one each of 3, 4, 7, and 8. A conservative yet strong opening is to bid 2 of a digit I have multiples of, like 2 9s or 2 1s. Since higher digits can be strategically advantageous later, I'll start with 2 9s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 7, 4, 3, 8, 9, 1, 9, 1. I have zero 0s, so for the current bid of 3 0s to be valid, the opponent would need to have all 3 or more zeros in their hand. Since they only have 8 digits, the chance they have 3 or more zeros is relatively low. Additionally, since the previous bid was 2 9s, which I know is valid because I hold two 9s, the opponent might be trying to mislead me with the jump to 3 0s. Given the unlikelihood that there are at least 3 zeros total, challenging is the best move.
