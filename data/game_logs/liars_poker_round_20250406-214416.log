Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is '1 0s', I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since my hand contains no 0s, bidding on 0s would not be strategic. However, I notice my hand has a variety of digits. A safe increase would be to bid on a digit I have, ensuring I at least contribute to the count. I have one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, and two 7s. Bidding on the digit '1' with a quantity of '2' seems reasonable because it's a low enough quantity that it might be achievable given the opponent could also have a '1', and it's higher than the current bid both in digit and quantity when considering the rules of bidding.
