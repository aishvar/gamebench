Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have four '2's in my hand, it's a strong starting point. Bidding on '2' with a quantity of 4 is a conservative but reasonable opening bid, as it's based on my own hand and leaves room for the opponent to respond.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 61704794. The current bid is '4 2s', made by Player 0. I have zero 2s in my hand. For the bid to be true, Player 0 must have at least four 2s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having four or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is extremely low (approximately 0.5%). Since I hold none of the bid digit, the likelihood of the current bid being true is very small. Making a higher bid, such as '4 3s' or '4 4s', is also risky. While I have two 4s and two 7s, bidding '4 4s' or '4 7s' relies on Player 0 having at least two of that digit, which is not guaranteed (probability ~18.7%). Challenging the current bid of '4 2s' has a very high probability of success.
