Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, and I already hold one, it is quite likely that at least one zero exists between both hands, making a challenge unwise. A minimal safe raise is to bid 2 0s, which is plausible considering I have one zero and the opponent could have at least one as well.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (77520956), I have zero 1s. Since the current bid is 2 1s and I hold none, all 1s would have to be in Player 0's hand to meet the bid, which is plausible but not guaranteed. However, bidding higher is generally safer early in the game. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 5s, and two 9s, making these digits good candidates for a higher bid. I can confidently increase the quantity to 3 based on my pairs. A bid of '3 5s' leverages my two 5s, requiring only one more 5 between both hands, which is quite reasonable.
