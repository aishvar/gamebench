Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have two 2s, one 4, one 6, one 8, one 9, and one 0. A safe starting bid would be to bid on a digit I have. Bidding 1 9s is a reasonable starting point as it's a relatively high digit and I have one in my hand. It's a low risk bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and the current bid is only 1 9. Given the low quantity and the fact that 9s are relatively rare, it's unlikely there's even one 9 in the other player's hand. Bidding higher seems risky without more information, so challenging is the safer option.
