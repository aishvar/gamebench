Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s and two 3s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with a safe bid based on my hand is strategic. Bidding 2 0s ensures the total is at least 2 (my two 0s), making it a valid and low-risk opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, so the opponent must have at least one 0 for their bid to be valid. However, bidding 2 9s (since I have two 9s) is a safer and valid move. It increases the digit value while maintaining the same quantity, ensuring the bid is truthful and forcing the opponent to either challenge (risky for them if I have two 9s) or bid higher.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand. The opponent's bid of 2 9s requires them to have at least two 9s in their 8-digit hand. Given the probabilities, there's an 81% chance they have fewer than two 9s (0 or 1), making a successful challenge likely. Bidding higher would require guessing their hand composition, which is riskier than challenging here.
