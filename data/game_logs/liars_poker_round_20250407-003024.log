--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. My hand contains the digits 3, 8, 0, 0, 3, 9, 5, 8. I have two 8s, which is a reasonable starting point. Bidding 4 8s seems safe, as it's likely there are at least four 8s in total when considering both players' hands.

Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, there are no 8s at all. Since I have zero 8s, for the current bid of 4 8s to be valid, the opponent would need to have all 4 or more 8s in their hand of 8 digits. The probability of one player having 4 or more 8s is quite low. Given this, it is unlikely that there are at least 4 eights in total, so challenging is the best move.
