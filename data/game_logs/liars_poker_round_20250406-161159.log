Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 4s, two 7s, and two other digits. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will choose 2 4s based on my hand, as I hold two 4s myself. This is a safe opening bid that reflects my hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have zero 4s in my hand (59513610). For the bid to be true, the opponent must have at least two 4s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of this is relatively low (approx. 18.7%). Challenging is a strong option. However, the bid is very low. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding '2 5s' is a minimal increase (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires zero or more 5s from the opponent to be true. The probability of the opponent having zero 5s is about 43%, meaning the bid '2 5s' has roughly a 57% chance of being true. Given it's early, making a safe, credible bid based on my hand seems strategically sounder than challenging such a low opening bid. It puts the pressure back on the opponent.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 5s, so the likelihood of there being at least two 5s relies entirely on Player 1's hand. Since Player 1 confidently bid 2 5s, it's plausible they have at least two 5s themselves, making that bid reasonable. To overbid, I should consider digits where I have a strong presence. I have three 0s and two 4s. The current bid is 2 5s, so I can raise to 3 0s, increasing the quantity and choosing a digit I hold strongly. This is a safe and strategic higher bid.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand (59513610). This means the bid is true if the opponent has two or more 0s in their 8 digits. While possible, it's not certain, making a challenge a consideration. However, I have strong counts of other digits. I have two 1s and two 5s. Bidding based on my hand seems safer. A bid must be higher than '3 0s'. Options include '3 1s', '3 3s', '3 5s', '3 6s', '3 9s', or increasing the quantity to 4. Bidding '3 1s' is well-supported as I hold two 1s, meaning the bid is true if the opponent holds just one 1 (which is statistically likely). This is a safer move than challenging '3 0s' or making a riskier bid like '4 1s'.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 1S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 0s, one 1, two 4s, one 7, and two other digits. The current bid is 3 1s, and I only have one 1, so for that bid to be valid, my opponent would likely need to have at least two 1s, which is plausible but uncertain. However, I have two 4s, making a bid of 3 4s quite reasonable and strictly higher (same quantity, higher digit). This is a safe incremental bid based on my hand's strength.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 4S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. My hand (59513610) contains zero 4s. For the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least three 4s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-card hand is low (approximately P(>=3) = P(3) + P(4) + ... ≈ 0.033 + 0.005 + ... ≈ 4%). Since I have no 4s, the probability that the bid is false is very high (~96%). Although Player 0 previously bid 2 4s, escalating to 3 4s seems like a significant risk for them unless they have a very strong hand in 4s, which is statistically unlikely. Challenging is the highest probability move.
