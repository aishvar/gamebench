--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, two 0s, and one each of 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9. Opening with a conservative but credible bid, I will choose '3 4s' because I hold two 4s myself, making it likely there are at least three 4s in total across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains one 4, one 0, one 6, two 2s, two 3s, and one 9. I have no 5s. The current bid is 3 5s, which is plausible if the opponent has three or more 5s, but since I have zero, it's somewhat risky to challenge now. Instead, I can raise the bid based on digits I hold multiple of. I have two 3s and two 2s, making a bid of 4 3s or 4 2s reasonable. Since 4 3s is a valid strictly higher bid (quantity increased from 3 to 4), and I hold two 3s myself, I'll bid 4 3s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (14423906), I have two 4s. The current bid is 4 4s, meaning there must be at least two more 4s in Player 1's hand to make the bid valid. Since each player has 8 digits, it's somewhat unlikely Player 1 holds two or more 4s, especially since I already have two. The probability that Player 1 has at least two 4s is low, making the current bid suspicious. Therefore, the optimal move is to challenge.
