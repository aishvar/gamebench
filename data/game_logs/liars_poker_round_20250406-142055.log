Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 20484295. I count 2 fours and 2 twos, and other digits appear once or not at all. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and consider the total number of players and digits. Since there are 4 players and 8 digits each, there are 32 digits in total. A bid of 3 or 4 for a digit I have seems reasonable. I have two 2s, so bidding on 2s could be a good start as it allows for a potential increase in quantity or digit later.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since I have a few digits in my hand that could contribute to a higher bid, I should consider increasing either the quantity or the digit. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32, and there are 4 players, I should assess my hand for potential digits to bid on. I have one 2, one 6, and other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. A reasonable next bid could be to increase the quantity or the digit. I have a 2, a 6, and other digits that could be used. A safe bet would be to increase the digit to a 3 or higher if possible, or increase the quantity if I have enough digits to make it believable.

--- Turn: Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one '2' in my hand. The current bid is 4 2s. With 4 players each having 8 digits, the total digits are 32. Given that I only have one '2', it's possible that other players have enough '2's to meet the bid. However, bidding higher would be risky since I don't have strong evidence to support a higher bid. Challenging seems premature as 4 2s is not an extreme bid. I'll make a conservative higher bid based on my hand.

Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand (86004901), I have zero 3s, so I cannot personally contribute to the current bid of 4 3s. Given 32 digits in total and my lack of 3s, the other three players must collectively have at least 4 3s to make the bid valid. Statistically, each digit appears roughly 3 times across all hands, so 4 3s is just slightly above average but plausible. However, since I have none, and the bid increased from 4 2s to 4 3s without raising quantity, it may be an attempt to push without strong evidence. Given the risk, challenging now is reasonable.
