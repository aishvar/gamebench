Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand 15203492, I notice I have two 2s, two 0s, and one each of 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9. A safe opening bid would be 2 2s or 2 0s, reflecting my hand strength. To be slightly aggressive while remaining plausible, I will start with 2 2s.
