Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (75510123), I have two 1s, two 5s, and one each of 0, 2, 3, and 7. Since I have two 5s in my hand, I know there are at least 2 fives total. A conservative first bid would be '2 5s'. However, I could also bid on 1s since I have two of those as well. Since 5 is a higher digit than 1, bidding on 5s gives me more room if the bidding comes back to me. I'll start with a modest bid of '2 5s' which I know is true based on my hand alone.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, but I do have two 6s. Since the current bid is only 2 5s, I can safely increase both the quantity and the digit by bidding 3 6s, which is a higher bid and seems reasonable based on my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of '3 6s'. Looking at my hand (75510123), I don't have any 6s. The opponent is claiming there are at least 3 sixes between our hands. Since I have zero 6s, all 3 would need to be in their hand. While this is possible, it's somewhat unlikely as they would need to have 3 out of their 8 digits be 6s (a 37.5% concentration). I could challenge, but there's still a reasonable chance they have 3 sixes. Alternatively, I could bid higher. I have two 5s in my hand, so I know there are at least 2 fives. I also have one 7, one 1, one 0, one 2, and one 3. I could bid '3 7s', but I only have one 7 so the opponent would need to have at least two 7s. Instead, I'll bid '4 1s' - I have one 1, so I'm claiming the opponent has at least three 1s, which is possible but puts pressure on them.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand, and the current bid is 4 1s. Since there are only 16 digits in total, it's unlikely there are 4 or more 1s. I should challenge the bid.
