Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 35029787, which contains two 7s. Since no bids have been made yet, starting conservatively makes sense. I will bid on digits I already have multiple of in my hand, making it safer. I have two 7s, so bidding at least 2 7s is a safe initial bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s, which means Player 0 is claiming there is at least one more 7 in their hand. Since the bid is relatively low and I have one 7, it's plausible that there are at least two 7s in total. I can safely make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 8, which I also have one of in my hand. Bidding 2 8s is a reasonable next move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 35029787, containing digits 3, 5, 0, 2, 9, 7, 8, and 7. I have exactly one '8'. The current bid is '2 8s', meaning the opponent claims there are at least two '8's in total. Given I already have one '8', it's plausible the opponent has at least one '8' as well. Therefore, challenging now would be risky. Instead, I will make a slightly higher and safer bid based on digits I have multiple of. I have two '7's in my hand. Previously, I bid '2 7s', and the opponent shifted the digit to '8's without increasing quantity. I can safely increase the quantity of '7's to 3, considering I already hold two '7's myself, making it likely one more '7' is present elsewhere.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which means the opponent must have at least two 7s to make this bid valid. Given that the bid is relatively low and I have one 7, it's plausible that the opponent has two 7s. However, since the bid is already at 3 7s, I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Considering my hand (41235270), I have two 5s, which could be a strong point. I can bid 3 5s, which is a higher digit than 7, but the same quantity. This is a safe move as it keeps the bid within reasonable limits based on my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. Since there are 16 digits in total (8 per player), it's possible that the opponent has two more 7s, making the total three. However, bidding higher would require either increasing the quantity or the digit. Given that I have a 5 and a 7, I can bid 3 8s, which is a higher digit than the current bid of 3 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 35029787, containing digits: 3, 5, 0, 2, 9, 7, 8, and 7. I have exactly one '8'. The opponent bid '3 8s', meaning they likely have at least two '8s'. With 16 digits total, having at least three '8s' is plausible. However, bidding higher (e.g., '4 0s' or '3 9s') would be speculative, as my hand doesn't strongly support any digit enough to confidently increase the bid. Given that the current bid of '3 8s' seems plausible, challenging is risky. Therefore, cautiously increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity seems safest. Since '3 9s' is the next valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit), and I have one '9', this bid is reasonable and relatively safe.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 9s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total, it's unlikely that the opponent has three 9s. Challenging seems like the best move.
