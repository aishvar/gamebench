Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. In my hand of 8 digits, I have three 9s and two 0s. A conservative yet credible opening bid is '3 9s' because I already hold three 9s, making the bid truthful based on my hand alone and setting a solid starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have 3 4s in my hand. Bidding 4 4s requires only one additional 4, which is statistically plausible given the remaining 24 digits (expected 2.4 4s in other hands). The bid is strategically strong and likely valid.

--- Turn: Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. Bidding 5 4s would be risky, as it requires at least 3 more 4s among the other players. Bidding a higher digit with a quantity of 4 seems more reasonable. I have one 5 in my hand, so bidding 4 5s is a plausible option. Alternatively, I could bid 5 3s, but that seems less strong given I only have one 3. Therefore, I will bid 4 5s.

--- Turn: Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand (07862983), so the total count of 5s could be higher than 4, but it's not certain. I need to either challenge or make a higher bid. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or bidding the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I see a 6 and a 9 in my hand, and 9 is higher than 5, I can bid 4 6s or 4 9s. Both are valid bids. However, bidding 4 9s is more conservative and still valid because it increases the digit. I will choose to bid 4 9s.

Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 4 9s, which requires there to be at least two more 9s among the remaining 24 digits. Statistically, that is plausible, so challenging now is risky. A safe and strategic move is to increase the bid slightly. I don't have enough 9s to confidently bid 5 9s, but I do have three 0s. Since the quantity is the same, I can raise the digit to 4 0s, which is a legal higher bid and keeps me in the game without overcommitting.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s. The current bid is 4 9s, so for that bid to be valid, there must be at least two more 9s among the remaining 24 digits held by other players. Statistically, expecting four or more 9s total is plausible, but pushing beyond that becomes increasingly unlikely. Since I must bid higher, the next options are 4 9s (already current), 4 0s (higher digit), 4 1s, ..., or increasing quantity to 5 of any digit. Based on my hand, I also have two 0s, so bidding 4 0s is not valid as it's not strictly higher. Bidding 4 9s is current, so I can only bid 5 9s or 5 of any digit. Given the risk, I think challenging is better because 4 9s is already somewhat aggressive, and I doubt there are 4 or more 9s total.
