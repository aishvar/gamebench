Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '20381403', I have three 0s. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, I know there are at least three 0s in total from my hand alone. Given that, a safe and natural raise would be to increase the quantity to 3 0s, which is both valid and supported by my hand.
