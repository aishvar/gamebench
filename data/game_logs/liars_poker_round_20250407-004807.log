Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a bid of 2 9s. This is a safe and strategic move given my hand composition and the high value of the digit 9.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s. Since the total digits are 16 and I hold none, the opponent would need to have at least 2 9s for the bid to be valid. This is plausible, so challenging now is risky. Instead, I can raise the bid conservatively. I have two 0s, so bidding 3 0s is reasonable as it only requires the opponent to have at least one 0, which is likely.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 0s in my hand, making it unlikely that the total meets the bid of 3 0s. Challenging is a strategic move to test the validity of the bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
