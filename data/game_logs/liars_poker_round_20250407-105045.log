Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. The current bid is 1 0s, which is plausible since I alone have one. It's risky to challenge now as the bid is minimal and likely true. The safest strategic move is to increment the bid slightly to maintain pressure without overcommitting. I also have two 6s, so bidding 2 6s increases the quantity and digit, making it a valid and reasonable next bid.
