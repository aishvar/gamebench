Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 81718272, I have: 2 8s, 2 7s, 2 2s, 1 1. Since this is the first bid and I have 2 8s, starting with a bid of '2 8s' is a reasonable opening move. It's conservative enough to be safe while using my highest digit that I have multiple of.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand (49963360). The current bid is 2 8s, which means the opponent would need to have at least two 8s in their hand. Since the maximum possible 8s in their hand is 8, and I have none, it's plausible but not guaranteed. However, with no 8s in my hand, challenging seems too risky. A safer move would be to bid higher with a digit I have more of, like 3 6s (I have two 6s).

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 81718272, I have no 6s. The opponent bid '3 6s', claiming there are at least 3 sixes total. Since I have zero 6s in my hand, this means the opponent would need to have at least 3 sixes in their hand of 8 digits for their bid to be true. While possible, having 3 or more of the same digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively unlikely. Given I have no 6s to support their claim, I should challenge rather than make a higher bid.
