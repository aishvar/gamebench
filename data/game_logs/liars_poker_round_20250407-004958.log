--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, two 8s, one 2, one 3, one 9, and one 9. A safe opening bid is usually 2 of a common digit in my hand. I'll start with 2 8s, as I hold two 8s myself, making it a strong and truthful opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (19477452), I have no 8s. The opponent bid '2 8s', claiming there are at least 2 eights total. Since I have zero 8s in my hand, this means all claimed 8s would need to be in their hand. While this is possible, I can make a safer bid. I see I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding '2 9s' would be a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and gives me room to maneuver if challenged later.

Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s (digits: 36968928). The current bid is 2 9s, which is fully accounted for just with my hand alone. Since there are 8 digits in my opponent's hand, it's quite plausible there could be at least one more 9, making a bid of 3 9s reasonable and safe. Therefore, I will raise the bid to 3 9s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (19477452), I have no 9s. The opponent has bid 3 9s, claiming there are at least three 9s total between our hands. Since I have zero 9s in my hand, this would mean they must have at least 3 9s in their hand of 8 digits. While possible, this seems unlikely as it would mean over 1/3 of their digits would need to be 9s. Additionally, their bidding pattern (moving from 2 8s to 2 9s to 3 9s) suggests they might be bluffing. Given this analysis, challenging seems like the best option.
