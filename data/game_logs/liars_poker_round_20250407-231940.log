Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid of two 7s is safe because even if the opponent has no 7s, the total (2) meets the bid. This establishes a baseline while leveraging my hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s, which is possible but not certain. To make a higher bid, I can increase the quantity to 3 7s, which is a reasonable assumption given the total of 16 digits in play. This bid increases the quantity while keeping the same digit, which is a valid move according to the rules.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, meaning the opponent needs at least one 7 in their 8-digit hand. Given the probabilistic distribution of digits (each digit has a 10% chance per slot), the opponent has approximately a 57% chance of having at least one 7. However, there's still a 43% chance they have none, making the total 7s exactly 2. Since the risk of challenging is substantial but plausible, and alternative bids (e.g., 3 8s/9s or 4 of lower digits) carry even lower probabilities of validity, challenging the bid offers a reasonable chance to win.
