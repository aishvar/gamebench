Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. Since I don't have any 6s in my hand, the maximum possible 6s in the game is 8. Bidding higher would require a digit I don't have enough of. Challenging seems reasonable as 3 6s might be a bluff.
