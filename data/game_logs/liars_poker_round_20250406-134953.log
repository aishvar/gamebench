Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s and two 5s. A bid of '2 5s' or '2 6s' seems reasonable. I will choose to bid '2 5s' as it is a lower digit and might be more believable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 6, 8, 6, 3, 7, 0, 3, 4. There are no 5s at all. Since the current bid is 2 5s, my opponent claims there are at least two 5s in total. Given that I hold zero 5s, for their bid to be valid, they must have both 5s themselves. This is possible but statistically less likely than them bluffing or overestimating. Therefore, challenging the bid here is a solid strategic move.
