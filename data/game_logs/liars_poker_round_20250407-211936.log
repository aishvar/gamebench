Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Analyzing my hand (84271046), the most frequent digits are 4 and 0, each appearing twice. A safe opening bid is to choose one of these digits with a quantity of 2. Between the two, bidding on 4 seems reasonable. Therefore, I will open with a conservative yet credible bid of 2 fours.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. My hand contains one 4, so there are at least 3 4s in total (including Player 0's hand). I can safely increase the bid to 3 4s, which is a valid higher bid. Since I have a 4, this bid is likely valid and challenging is unnecessary.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. Looking at my hand (84271046), I have two 4s. For the total count to be at least 3, the opponent would only need to have at least one 4, which is quite plausible given the distribution across 8 digits. Therefore, challenging now is risky. The next minimum valid bid would be 3 5s or 4 0s (since quantity must increase or digit increase with same quantity). Bidding 3 5s is conservative and keeps the game going without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. My hand contains one 5. Assuming the opponent has at most two 5s, the total possible 5s is 3, which matches the current bid. Since I cannot bid higher without exceeding the plausible total (4 5s would require at least one more 5 in the opponent's hand, which is uncertain), challenging is the safer move.
