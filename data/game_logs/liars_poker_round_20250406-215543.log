Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 7s and two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 2 4s, which is relatively low. I can bid 3 6s, which is a higher quantity than the current bid while also using a digit that I have in my hand. This is a reasonable and strategic move.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I could bid 4 0s, 4 1s, 4 2s, 4 3s, 4 4s, 4 5s, 4 6s, 4 7s, 4 8s, 4 9s, or I could bid 3 7s, 3 8s, 3 9s. I will bid 4 0s. This is a safe bid, and I don't have enough information to challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s and two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 4 0s, which seems low given the digits I hold. I can bid 5 6s, increasing both the quantity and the digit, which is a reasonable move based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 6 6s is a safe increase and a valid bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 6S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 6 6s. To make a valid higher bid, I can bid 7 6s, which is a higher quantity while keeping the same digit. This seems reasonable given my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 6S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 7 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 8 6s is a small increase and keeps the same digit, which is a safe option. Since the previous bids on 6s have been incremental, it might be believable.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 6S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 8 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand, which means there are at least three 6s accounted for in my own hand. The current bid is 8 6s, which means I need to bid higher. I can bid 9 6s since I can reasonably assume that there are enough 6s in total across both hands to support this bid. This keeps the digit the same while increasing the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 6S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 9 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. It seems unlikely that there are at least nine 6s in total. I will challenge.
