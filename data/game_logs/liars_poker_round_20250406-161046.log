Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game. My hand is 57498329. I have two 9s, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. With 16 total digits in play between two players, the expected count for any digit is 1.6. Having two 9s myself makes it plausible that there are at least three 9s in total (assuming the opponent has at least one). Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable opening bid based on my hand's strength in that digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand '20027653', I have zero 9s. Since there are only 16 digits in total and I hold none of the 9s, all 3 or more 9s would have to be in Player 0's hand. The probability that Player 0 has 3 or more 9s in their 8-digit hand is quite low. Therefore, it's unlikely the total number of 9s reaches 3, making this a good spot to challenge.
