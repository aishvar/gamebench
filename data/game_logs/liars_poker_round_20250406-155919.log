Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand 04886154, I have two 8s, which is a strong starting point. Opening with '2 8s' is reasonable, as it's supported by my hand alone and puts some pressure on my opponent to raise with less certainty.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze what's in my hand and what's a reasonable next move. Looking at my hand (77429291), I have zero 8s. The current bid is '2 8s', meaning Player 0 is claiming there are at least 2 eights between both our hands. Since I have none, all claimed 8s would have to be in Player 0's hand. It's quite possible they have 2 or more 8s, making their bid truthful. I could challenge, but it seems risky given this is just the opening bid and a reasonable one. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, one 4, one 2, two 9s, and one 1. I could bid on 7s or 9s since I have two of each. I'll bid '2 9s', which is higher than '2 8s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity.

Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s, so all 9s would have to be in my opponent's hand to satisfy the current bid of 2 9s. While it's possible they have 2 or more 9s, it's not highly probable. However, challenging on 2 9s is risky since it's quite plausible. Instead, I can safely raise the bid by increasing the quantity on a digit I have multiple copies of. I have two 8s, so a bid of 3 8s is reasonable, implying at least one 8 on their side, which is likely.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '3 8s'. Looking at my hand (77429291), I have zero 8s. This means for the bid '3 8s' to be valid, Player 0 would need to have at least 3 8s in their hand. While this is possible, it's somewhat unlikely that they would have exactly 3 or more 8s. Also, their bidding pattern (starting with '2 8s', then raising to '3 8s' after I bid '2 9s') suggests they might be bluffing by incrementing their original bid. Given I have no 8s in my hand, I think challenging is the better option here rather than making a higher bid that would be based purely on speculation.
