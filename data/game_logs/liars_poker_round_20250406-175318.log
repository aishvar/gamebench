Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is 1 0s and I can see one 0 myself, it's quite likely there is at least one 0 in total, so challenging now would be unwise. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or the digit. I have three 7s and two 9s, which are strong digits to bid on. Bidding 2 7s is a safe incremental bid that is strictly higher than 1 0s, leveraging my strong count of 7s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 75029779, I have two 7s and no 8s. The current bid is 2 8s. Since I have zero 8s, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least two 8s, which is plausible but not highly likely given only 8 digits. The naive player increased from 2 7s to 2 8s, possibly bluffing. With zero 8s in my hand, challenging here is reasonable because the likelihood they have both 8s is low.
