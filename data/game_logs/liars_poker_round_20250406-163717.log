Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid. I will start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s and two 8s. A bid of 2 8s seems reasonable as a starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. Bidding 2 9s increases the digit value while maintaining the same quantity, making it a valid higher bid. Since 9 is higher than 8, this bid is strategically sound and shifts the focus to a digit I hold (1 nine), increasing the likelihood of forcing the opponent into a weaker position.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains a 6, 7, 5, 2, 9, 8, 4, and 3. I see one 9 in my hand, so there is at least one 9 in total. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 9 and the current bid is 2 9s, I can try to bid higher on the quantity or the digit. I have two 8s and two other digits that are higher than 9, but not enough information about other player's hand. I will increase the quantity to 3 and keep the digit as 9 because I have one 9.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. To meet the bid, the opponent must have at least two 9s. Given random distributions, the probability of them having two or more 9s (needed to reach the bid's total of 3) is only ~18.7%, making challenging favorable.
