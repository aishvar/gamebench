Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I examine my hand (04781914) and notice that I hold two 1s, which is a strong count given that the average occurrence per digit is about 1.6 in a total of 16 cards. With no prior bids, starting with a bid that reflects a count I can fully account for is a safe opening move. By bidding '2 1s', I leverage my hand’s strength, and if challenged later I can confirm I hold exactly two 1s, making the bid verifiable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 66926437, I have a total of 3 sixes, 2 fours, 2 threes, 1 nine, 1 seven, 1 two, 1 one, and 1 zero. I can see that bidding 3 or more of a higher digit than 1 would be a good strategy. I have 2 sixes, which could potentially make a strong bid if I consider the possibility of Player 0 having some of these digits as well.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand (04781914) contains no 6s, so for the current bid of '3 6s' to be true, the opponent's 8 digits would need to contain all three 6s—a very unlikely event given the probability of around 3-4% for any given digit to appear three times in 8 random digits. Therefore, the opponent's bid is extremely suspicious, and it's best to challenge.
