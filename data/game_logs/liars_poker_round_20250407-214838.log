Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand (95750284), the digit distribution is: 0(1), 2(1), 4(1), 5(2), 7(1), 8(1), 9(1). The most frequent digit in my hand is '5' with 2 occurrences. A conservative opening bid would be '2 5', indicating at least 2 fives across both hands, which is guaranteed from my hand alone. This is a safe and strategic opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. My hand contains 1 '5', so the bid would be valid only if the opponent has at least 1 '5'. Challenging risks losing if they have a '5'. Raising the bid to 2 6s is valid (same quantity but higher digit) and safe since I have 2 '6's. This forces the opponent to either challenge or escalate further, leveraging my existing 2 '6's.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand, 95750284, I have no 6s. The current bid is 2 6s, meaning there must be at least two 6s among both hands. Since I have zero 6s, both of those would have to be in Player 1's hand, which is possible but somewhat unlikely given only 8 digits. It's risky to assume Player 1 has exactly two or more 6s, especially since they raised from 2 5s to 2 6s, possibly bluffing. Given the unlikelihood of Player 1 having both 6s, challenging now is a strategic move.
