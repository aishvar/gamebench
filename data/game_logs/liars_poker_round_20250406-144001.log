Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. Bidding 2 1s is safe since my own count already meets the bid, making it valid. Starting with a bid I can confidently uphold while setting a baseline for future bids.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 7, 5, 5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 1, which includes exactly one '1'. Since the current bid is 2 1s, there would need to be at least one more '1' in Player 0's hand. This is quite plausible, so challenging now would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. The minimal valid higher bid is 2 2s, which increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, and seems reasonable given the early stage of the game.

Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. Bidding 3 1s increases the quantity from the current bid of 2 2s. This leverages my existing 1s and requires only one more 1 from the opponent, which is plausible given random distribution.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains no 1s at all, making the current bid of 3 1s quite risky for my opponent. Since I hold zero 1s, all three would need to be in Player 0's hand, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. The probability that Player 0 has 3 or more 1s is low, so challenging is the optimal move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
