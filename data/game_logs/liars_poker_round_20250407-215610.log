Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my first turn. I need to make a valid bid that could potentially be higher than what the other player might have. Analyzing my hand: 89721662, I have 3 sixes, 2 sevens are not present, 1 eight, 1 nine, and the rest are unique. A safe bet would be to bid on a digit that I have multiple instances of or a high digit that could potentially add up quickly across both hands. Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a low to moderate digit that is likely to appear in both hands but not too high to be immediately challenged.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my first turn. I should start with a conservative bid to test the waters. I have two 6's and two 7's in my hand, but I don't know my opponent's hand. A bid of '1 6' seems reasonable as it doesn't overcommit and allows me to gauge my opponent's response.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 six. Looking at my hand (05433802), I have zero sixes. Since there are 8 digits in my opponent's hand, the total number of sixes across both hands can be anywhere from 0 to 8. The bid of 1 six is quite conservative and very likely to be true, as it only requires there to be a single six in the opponent's hand. Therefore, challenging now would be premature. The best move is to increase the bid to maintain pressure and gather more information. A straightforward higher bid would be 1 seven, since it increases the digit without increasing the count, which is the minimal increment.

Player 1 bids: 1 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Analyzing the current bid of '1 7s' made by Player 1, I need to consider if I can make a valid higher bid or if I should challenge. My hand is 89721662, which contains one 7. Given that the current bid is '1 7s', to make a higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 7 in my hand, bidding higher on 7s is not possible. I should look for another digit that appears more than once or a higher digit. In my hand, the digit 6 appears twice. The bid history shows that Player 1 bid '1 7s' after Player 0 bid '1 6s'. I can make a bid on 6s with a quantity higher than 1 or bid on a different digit with a quantity of 1 or more if it's higher than 7. My best move is to bid on 6s with a quantity of 2 because it's a valid higher bid.

Player 0 bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 05433802, which contains zero 6s and one 7. The current bid is 2 6s. Since I have no 6s, Player 0 must be claiming that there are at least two 6s across both hands, implying they likely have both 6s themselves. That is plausible, but still somewhat risky. Alternatively, I can consider raising the bid. Since I have one 7, a bid of 2 7s is reasonable, as Player 0 could plausibly have at least one 7. This is a safer incremental bid compared to accepting the 2 6s claim, which I cannot support at all from my hand. Therefore, the best strategic move is to bid 2 7s, increasing the quantity on a digit I hold, rather than challenge immediately or bid on 6s I don't have.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Analyzing the current bid of '2 7s' made by Player 1, I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is the best option. Given my hand '89721662', I count 3 occurrences of the digit '7' is not present but I have multiple '6's and other digits. The current bid is '2 7s', so I must either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any '7's, I will focus on increasing the digit or the quantity of a digit I have. I have 3 '6's and 1 '8', 1 '9', 1 '2', 1 '1', and 1 '4' is not present but there are other digits. I can bid on '3 6s' as it's higher in quantity than '2 7s' and I have the digits to back it up.

Player 0 bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (05433802), there are no 6s and no 7s. The opponent has bid 3 6s, implying at least 3 sixes across both hands. Since I hold zero 6s, all three must be in the opponent's hand. While it's possible, it's somewhat unlikely given only 8 digits. The earlier bid history shows the opponent favoring 6s and me favoring 7s, with the opponent pushing the count from 1 to 3 sixes. Given the low probability of the opponent having 3 sixes and my zero, challenging is strategically sound. A higher bid on 7s (3 7s) is risky since I have zero 7s as well, and it would be a bluff. Therefore, the best move is to challenge.
