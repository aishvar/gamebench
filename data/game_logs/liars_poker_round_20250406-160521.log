Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 3s, two 6s, one 4, one 5, two 2s, and one 9. A safe opening bid is typically 2 of a digit I have at least two of. I will open with '2 6s' as I hold two 6s, making it a solid and credible starting bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (46017543). This means the bid is true if the opponent (Player 0) has at least one 6, which is quite likely with 8 unknown digits in their hand. Challenging a low bid like 2 6s is risky. I should make a higher bid. My options are bids with quantity 3 (any digit) or bids with quantity 2 and a digit higher than 6 (7, 8, 9). I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 3 4s is a valid higher bid (increasing the quantity from 2 to 3). This bid requires the opponent to have at least one 4 for it to be true, which is plausible. This seems like a reasonable step up from the current bid, utilizing the strength of my hand (two 4s).

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 83458629, I have one 4 and two 6s. The current bid is 3 4s. Since I only have one 4, Player 1 would need to have at least two 4s for the bid to be valid. This is plausible but somewhat risky to challenge. Alternatively, I can raise the bid. Given that I have two 6s, bidding 3 6s (same quantity, higher digit) is a safe incremental bid that leverages my hand.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 46017543. I have one 6 and two 4s. The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 0. Player 0 previously bid 2 6s, I bid 3 4s, and then Player 0 bid 3 6s. This sequence suggests Player 0 is confident about the number of 6s, likely having at least two 6s in their hand (making the total count 1 + 2 = 3). Challenging 3 6s seems risky as it's plausible Player 0 has the required two 6s. I need to make a higher bid. Possible bids are 3 7s, 3 8s, 3 9s, or 4 of any digit. I have two 4s, which is the digit I have the most of. Bidding 4 4s requires Player 0 to have at least two 4s among their 8 digits. While Player 0 didn't contest my previous 3 4s bid directly (they raised with 3 6s), bidding 4 4s is based on the strongest part of my hand and forces Player 0 to make a significantly higher bid or challenge.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 83458629, I have zero 4s. The current bid is 4 4s, which means there must be at least four 4s across both hands. Since I have none, for the bid to be valid, my opponent must have all four or more 4s, which is possible but statistically unlikely given only 8 digits per hand. The probability that one player has four or more of a specific digit is low. Therefore, it's a good opportunity to challenge the bid.
