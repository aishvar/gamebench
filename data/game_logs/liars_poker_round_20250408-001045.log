Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. I could challenge, but there might be four 5s between the other player's hand. I have two 7s. The last bid before the current one was 3 7s. I can raise the bid to 4 7s.
