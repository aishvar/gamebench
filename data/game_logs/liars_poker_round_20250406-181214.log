Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 'None', I should make an initial bid based on my hand. I have 4 digits in my hand that are greater than or equal to 5, and 3 digits that are greater than or equal to 6. Since 6 is the highest digit in my hand, I should bid on it. With 4 digits in my hand that are 6 or higher, I can reasonably bid 4 6s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable increase in digit, as I have one 9 in my hand, and the quantity is lower than the current bid, making it a valid higher bid.
