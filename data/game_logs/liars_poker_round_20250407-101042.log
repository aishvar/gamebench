Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I see two 0s. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, I know there are at least two 0s total. Therefore, I can confidently raise the bid to 2 0s, which is a strictly higher bid and well-supported by my hand.

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 2 1s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (98100775), I have two 0s and zero 1s. The current bid is 2 1s, which requires there to be at least two 1s in total across both hands. Since I have none, all 1s must be in Player 0's hand, which is unlikely. The chance that Player 0 has two or more 1s out of eight digits is low. Therefore, challenging is a strong option here rather than making a riskier higher bid.
