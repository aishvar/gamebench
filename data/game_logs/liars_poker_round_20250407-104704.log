Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 7s, two 8s, one 4, and one 3. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 7s, reflecting my two 7s and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8 and two 7s. The current bid is 2 8s. Since I already hold one 8, it's quite plausible there is at least one more 8 in the opponent's hand, making the current bid reasonable. To increase conservatively, I can bid 3 7s, since I hold two 7s myself, and it's likely there is at least one more 7 in the opponent's hand. This is a minimal but valid raise, increasing the quantity from 2 to 3 and reverting to a digit I have good evidence for.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 74720083, I have two 8s and one 7. The current bid is 3 8s. Since I have two 8s myself, it is quite plausible that at least one more 8 exists in Player 1's hand, making the total 3 or more. Therefore, challenging now is risky. To make a higher bid, I can increase the digit at the same quantity, but since the current bid is already on 8s, the only way to raise is to bid 3 9s or increase the quantity. Given I only have one 7, bidding 4 7s would be aggressive but plausible, as I already had confidence to bid 3 7s before. Alternatively, bidding 4 8s aligns better with my hand, as I hold two 8s, so it's reasonable to expect two more 8s in total. Thus, the best strategic move is to bid 4 8s.
