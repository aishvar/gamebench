Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. I have two 0s, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 8 in my hand. A conservative bid would be 1 of any digit. I will bid 1 0s, as I have two of them.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand (from digit 0). The current bid is 1 0s, which is very low. Since I have one 0, it's likely there are at least one or two more 0s among the other players' hands. Bidding 2 0s is a safe increase that is likely to be true.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 0S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) bids: 2 0s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. My hand is 88911436, which contains no 0s. Given that there are 3 players and each has 8 digits, the total number of digits is 24. A bid of 2 0s implies that there are at least 2 zeros across all hands. Since I have no 0s, the 2 0s must be distributed among the other two players. This seems plausible but not certain. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I will increase the digit to make a higher bid. Bidding 2 1s is a valid higher bid because it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit. Upon examining my hand, I see I have one 1, so it's reasonable to think there could be at least 2 ones in total among all players.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 1S'
Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have no 1s in my hand, making it plausible that the bid is an overestimation. However, other players could have 1s. I have two 0s, and the previous bids were focused on 0s, so it's possible there are more 0s. I will bid 3 0s, which is higher than the previous bid of 2 0s and the current bid of 2 1s. It's a relatively safe bid given my hand and the recent bidding history.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s, which seems high given that I have none. However, since there are two other players, it's possible they have multiple 0s. To be safe, I will increase the bid slightly by bidding on a digit I have in my hand, which is 4. Bidding 3 4s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 4S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have one 4 in my hand (88911436). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I see one 4 in my hand, it's possible others have 4s as well, but I don't have information about their hands. I can bid 3 5s, increasing the digit, or bid 4 0s, 4 1s, 4 2s, 4 3s, or 4 4s, increasing the quantity. Given my hand has two 8s, I can confidently bid on 8s. Bidding 4 8s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and is based on my hand having two 8s, making it plausible that the total count could be at least 4.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. It's unlikely there are three more 8s among the other two players' hands, but not impossible. However, bidding higher on 8s is risky. I have two 6s, and the previous bids focused on 0s, 1s and 4s. Bidding 5 6s is a reasonable increase in quantity and is not a digit that has been bid on heavily yet. It's a safer bid than increasing the 8s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand ('41234921'). The current bid is 5 6s, which seems high given that I have none and the previous bids suggest moderate digit counts. Challenging is a reasonable move as it's unlikely there are five 6s across all hands.
