Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I analyzed my hand (23519127) and noted that I have two 2s. Since there are 16 total digits in play and my opponent's digits are unknown, bidding 2 2s is a safe and credible opening bid because I already guarantee the bid with my own hand. It also forces my opponent to either raise or risk a challenge later when the bid increases.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. I could bid 3 0s, 3 1s, 3 3s, etc. I have three 6s, so bidding 3 6s is a safe and reasonable increase.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, meaning the bid of 3 6s depends solely on the opponent's 8 unknown digits. The probability that the opponent holds at least 3 6s is extremely low (around 3.8%), making the current bid highly unlikely to be valid. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move.
