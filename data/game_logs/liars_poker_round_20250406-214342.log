Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s and two 2s in my hand. Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable bid. Bidding 3 7s is a good starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 7.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I do not have any 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which would require Player 0 to have all three 7s in their hand. Given that I have none, challenging this bid is a strategic move to test the validity of the claim.
