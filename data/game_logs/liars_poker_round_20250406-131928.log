Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None'. I have two 6s and one 8 in my hand. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that other players have at least one 6.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. Bidding 4 6s would be risky as it's unlikely there are four 6s total. However, bidding 3 7s is a valid and reasonable move, as it maintains the quantity but increases the digit. I don't have any 7s, but it's still more plausible than a higher quantity of 6s. Bidding 4 0s is also possible, but 7s feels like a slightly better play given the current bid.

Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. My hand is 64432550, which contains one 7. So, the total count of 7s across all hands is at least 1 (mine) plus whatever the other two players have. Since there are 8 digits per player, it's possible the other players have more 7s. I can bid higher than 3 7s by either increasing the quantity or bidding on a higher digit. I will increase the quantity to 4 and keep the digit the same, making it 4 7s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have two 6s in my hand and have already bid 3 6s in an earlier round. Since the current bid is only one higher than my previous bid and the digit is only one higher, it's plausible that the bid is valid. I can try to increase the digit to 8, as I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 5 8s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
