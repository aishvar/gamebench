Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without worrying about being too high or challenging. I have two 6s and two 7s in my hand. A bid of '2 6s' or '2 7s' seems reasonable and not too risky given the current state of the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 7, 5, 3, 0, 9, 9, 9, 2, which contains no 6s. Since there are no 6s in my hand, the current bid of 2 6s relies entirely on the other two players collectively having at least two 6s out of their 16 digits. Statistically, this is plausible, as the expected average per digit across all 24 cards is about 2.4. Therefore, challenging now is risky. A safe strategic move is to increase the bid slightly while not overcommitting. The minimal valid raise is to keep the quantity at 2 and increase the digit. The next higher digit is 7. I have one 7 in my hand, so bidding 2 7s is reasonable.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand, and I know there is at least one more 7 in play (from Player 1's bid). Bidding 3 7s is a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity of the current bid. Challenging seems premature, as 2 7s is quite likely.

Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. Given that I have a 6 and a 7 in my hand, and considering the bid history, I should assess the likelihood of there being 3 or more 7s in total. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and there are only 3 players, I should consider if my hand can support a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent. My hand contains one 7, so I know there are at least 2 7s (including mine). The bid of 3 7s seems plausible but I need to consider if I can reasonably make a higher bid or if challenging is the best option.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (75309992), I have two 7s. Given the total of 24 digits, a bid of 4 7s requires at least two more 7s among the other 16 digits. Since the previous bids have escalated quickly on 7s, it's plausible but starting to become risky. However, with two 7s myself, a conservative approach is to challenge now, as pushing to 5 7s would likely be overreaching. I believe 4 7s is already a borderline bid, so challenging is the best move.
