--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 3, one 4, one 7, one 8, two 4s total (since digit 4 appears twice), one 6, and one additional 1 (correction: only one 1). The most frequent digits in my hand are two 4s. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 4s, reflecting my strong holding in that digit and setting a solid baseline.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I don't have any 4s in my hand. Since the current bid is low, I can bid a slightly higher amount of a different digit. I have two 7s, so I will bid 3 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 73461481, which contains one 7. The current bid is 3 7s, implying at least three 7s between both hands. Since I only have one 7, Player 1 would need to have at least two 7s for the bid to be valid. While that's possible, it's somewhat unlikely given the distribution. Rather than risk increasing the bid without strong evidence, I will challenge the current bid, as it's plausible Player 1 is bluffing or overestimating.
