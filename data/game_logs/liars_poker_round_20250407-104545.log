Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 9s, two 8s, one 4, and one 6. A safe opening bid is to call 2 of a digit I have multiples of. I will choose 2 8s, as I have two in my hand, making it quite probable there are more in total.
