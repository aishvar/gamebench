Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (13289440), I have two 4s. Bidding 2 4s is a safe starting point, as it's based on the digits I have and sets a baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The opponent has bid '2 4s', which means they claim there are at least 2 fours in total between our hands. Looking at my hand (32961558), I have zero 4s. This means all the 4s would have to be in the opponent's hand. Since they bid only 2 4s, it's quite possible they have at least 2 fours, making their bid reasonable. I need to make a higher bid based on what I know about my own hand. I have two 5s, one 3, one 2, one 9, one 6, one 1, and one 8. The most frequent digit in my hand is 5, appearing twice. I could bid '2 5s', which is higher than '2 4s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity. This is a safe bid since I know I have two 5s myself.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s, which means there must be at least one more 5 in the other player's hand. To make a valid higher bid, I can increase the quantity to 3 5s, which is reasonable given the possibility of the other player having at least one 5.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of '3 5s'. Looking at my hand (32961558), I have two 5s. Since there are two players with 8 digits each, there are 16 total digits in play. The opponent claims there are at least 3 fives total. Since I have 2 fives, this means the opponent is claiming they have at least 1 five in their hand. This is quite reasonable and likely true. Given that I know I have two 5s already, I could safely bid '4 5s', but that would be risky if the opponent has no 5s. I could also bid '3 6s', which is a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 6, so bidding '3 6s' would mean the opponent needs to have at least two 6s, which is possible but not certain. Another option is to bid something like '3 8s' since I have two 8s in my hand. This would be a safer bid. I'll go with '3 8s' as it's higher than '3 5s' and I'm confident in it based on my hand.

Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which means there must be at least two more 8s in Player 1's hand. However, given the bidding history and the digits in my hand, it's unlikely that Player 1 has two more 8s. Bidding higher would require increasing the quantity or digit, but without more 8s or higher digits in my hand, it's safer to challenge the current bid.
