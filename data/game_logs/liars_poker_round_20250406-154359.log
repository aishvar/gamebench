Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s, which seems like a good starting point. The bid should be higher than 0, and I can start with a low quantity to test the waters.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s (digits: 86023673). Since the current bid is 2 6s, and I already possess two, it's quite likely there could be more 6s in the opponent's hand. Therefore, challenging now would be risky. A safe and strategic move is to increase the bid slightly, for example, to 2 7s, which is a minimal raise respecting the rules, keeping pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have a 6 in my hand, and I can see that bidding a higher quantity or digit is possible. Since I have one 6, I can reasonably bid that there are at least 3 6s in total, considering my own hand and the possibility of my opponent having some as well.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 86023673, I have two 6s and two 3s. The current bid is 3 6s. Since I hold two 6s myself, it's plausible there is at least one more 6 in the opponent's hand, making the bid reasonable. To raise, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and bid on a higher digit. I have two 7s, so bidding 3 7s is a safe, strictly higher bid matching the quantity but increasing the digit. This is a conservative yet valid move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 5, 2, 1, 0, 3, 0, 8, 2. I have two 0s, which could be useful. However, I should also consider the possibility of higher digits being present in Player 1's hand. Since the current bid is 3 7s, I should either increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 0s and two 2s, but no 7s or higher digits that could easily compete. A safe bet would be to increase the quantity or digit slightly, considering my available digits. I can see that bidding 4 0s could be a reasonable move as it increases both the quantity and digit compared to 3 7s, and I have two 0s in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 86023673, I have one 0. Since there are 16 digits total, for the bid of 4 0s to be valid, there must be at least 3 zeros in the opponent's hand. Given that zeros are usually less common and I only have one, it is statistically unlikely the opponent has three or more zeros. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
