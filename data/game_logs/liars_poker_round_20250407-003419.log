Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have two 9s in my hand. A conservative starting bid would be 1 9s. This establishes a baseline without being overly aggressive.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 1 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 1 9s, which is already matched by my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 9, increasing the quantity to 2 9s is not possible without risking a challenge. However, I can bid 2 of a higher digit, such as 2 0s, which I have two of in my hand. This increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a valid and reasonable bid.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 2 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. My previous bid was 1 9s, and I have two 9s. Increasing the quantity of 9s to 3 seems reasonable. Alternatively, I could bid on another digit I have, like 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Bidding 3 9s is a safe and logical next step, as it increases the quantity of a digit I know I have at least one of.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 9s. Since I only have one 9, it's unlikely there are three 9s in total. Instead of challenging, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity of a different digit. I have three 0s in my hand, so bidding 4 0s seems reasonable, as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. The previous bids show a pattern of escalating 9s from me and 0s from the opponent. While I could challenge, it's early in the game and challenging a 4 of anything is relatively low risk for my opponent. Instead, I will bid higher, focusing on a digit I have multiple of. I have two 9s. Bidding 5 9s is a reasonable escalation, as it's higher in quantity than the previous 3 9s and the opponent has been focusing on 0s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 9S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 5 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, so there could be up to 2 9s in total if the other player has one as well. Bidding 6 9s is not feasible since it's unlikely there are 6 9s in total. Instead, I can switch to a different digit. I have four 0s in my hand, so bidding 6 0s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 0S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. The previous bids show a pattern of Player 1 bidding on 0s and me bidding on 9s. Player 1 seems determined to push the 0s bid. Given I have two 9s, and the previous bid was 5 9s, bidding 7 9s is a logical next step to continue the pattern and potentially bluff. It's a relatively safe bid considering my hand, and it increases the quantity without changing the digit. Bidding higher on 0s would be a very risky and unlikely proposition given my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 9S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 7 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. I have only one 9 in my hand, and the maximum possible 9s in play is 2 (my one 9 and potentially one from the opponent). Bidding 8 9s is impossible as it exceeds the maximum possible count. Instead, I should challenge the bid as it's highly unlikely to be true.
