Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (47132582), I can see the distribution of digits is relatively even. A safe opening bid is one of the most common digits in my hand, and I have two '2's. I will bid 2 twos ('2 2') to start conservatively while leaving room for higher bids later.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 twos. Looking at my hand (53860990), I have no twos at all. Since I hold 8 digits and have zero twos, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least 2 twos in their 8 digits. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely given the average expected count of each digit is about 1.6 (16 digits / 10 digits â‰ˆ 1.6). Given that I have zero twos, the chance they have 2 or more is less than 50%. Therefore, challenging now is strategically sound.
