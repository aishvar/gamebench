Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 3, 4, 1, 7, 8, 2, 7, 1. I have zero 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s relies entirely on the opponent having at least one 0. Since there are 8 digits in the opponent's hand, it's plausible they have at least one 0, so challenging now is risky. A safe and minimal higher bid would be increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, such as 1 1s. I have two 1s in my hand, making this bid quite safe.
