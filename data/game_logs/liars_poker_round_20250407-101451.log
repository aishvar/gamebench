Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 3s, two 0s, two 9s, one 7, and one 8. Since the current bid is 1 0s and I hold two 0s myself, I know there are at least two 0s in total, so the current bid is definitely safe. To make a strictly higher bid, I can increase the quantity or the digit. The simplest is to increase the quantity on 0s to 2 0s, which I know is certainly true. This is a safe and minimal raise.
