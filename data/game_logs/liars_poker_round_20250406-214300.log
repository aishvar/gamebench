Round setup complete. Starting bids.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the opening bid, and my hand contains two 0s, two 3s, two 4s, one 1, and one 5. Since there are 16 digits total, a conservative but reasonable opening bid would be 3 of a digit I have multiple of. I will start with 3 3s because I have two 3s myself, making this a safe and strategic opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s. Considering the total possible count of any digit is 16 and I only have one 3, bidding higher might be risky. However, I also have other digits that could potentially be bid upon. Since I don't have enough information to safely challenge or make a significantly higher bid with confidence, I should look for a safe increase. Given my hand, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same seems like a plausible strategy. I notice I have a 6 and a 9, both of which are higher than 3. Between the two, bidding on the 6 seems safer because it's lower, thus potentially more likely to occur.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 1, 3, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 8. I have zero 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, meaning there must be at least three 6s across both hands. Since I have none, the entire count would have to come from Player 1's hand, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. The probability of Player 1 holding 3 or more 6s is quite low, so challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 1's (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bid of 3 6s.
