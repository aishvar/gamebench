Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: For my opening bid, I should analyze my hand and make a strategic initial bid. In my hand of 92708573, I have one 7, one 5, one 3, one 2, one 8, one 9, one 0. Since I know I have one 7 and there could be several more 7s in the opponent's hand (up to 8 more possible), bidding 3 sevens is a relatively safe opening bid. This leaves room for higher bids while not being too conservative.

--- Turn: Player 1 (Random(openrouter/cohere/command-a:floor)) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (Random(openrouter/cohere/command-a:floor)), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. In my hand, I have one 7. Since the maximum possible 7s across both hands is 2 (from my hand) + 2 (from the opponent's hand), the highest valid bid for 7s is 4. However, the current bid of 3 7s is already close to the maximum possible. Given that the opponent's hand is unknown, it's safer to challenge the bid rather than risk overbidding.
