Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 3 9s sets a strong initial claim using my highest-count digit. It allows room for escalation but also leverages my existing 2 9s, making it plausible if the opponent has at least one more 9. Bidding higher digits early can pressure opponents to either raise or challenge.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The opponent's bid is 3 9s, which means there must be at least two more 9s in their hand. Since each player only has eight digits, having three or more 9s in total is plausible but somewhat unlikely. However, it is not improbable enough to confidently challenge right now. A safe strategic move is to increase the quantity to 4 but switch to a digit I have more of. I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding 4 5s leverages my known digits and pressures the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid since 9 > 5. I have two 9s in my hand (04096962), which includes two 9s). Assuming the opponent has at least two more 9s, this bid could be valid. This avoids challenging the current bid, which carries a higher risk if the opponent has 4 or more 5s.

Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 4 9s, which would require at least three 9s in the opponent's hand to be valid. Given that 9s are relatively rare and I only have one, the probability that there are at least three more in just 8 digits is quite low. Therefore, I believe it's unlikely that there are 4 or more 9s total, so I should challenge.
