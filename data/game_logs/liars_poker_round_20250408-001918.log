--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand (71203754). For the bid to be true, the opponent must have at least two 8s. While possible, challenging such a low opening bid is risky. I have two 7s in my hand. The expected number of 7s in the opponent's 8-digit hand is 0.8. Therefore, a total count of three 7s (my two plus at least one from the opponent) is reasonably likely (probability > 50%). Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid than 2 8s (higher quantity) and is supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, making it uncertain if the total is 3. Challenging is a safer move as it could reveal the opponent's potential bluff.
