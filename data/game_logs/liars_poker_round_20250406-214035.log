Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. Bidding 4 6s assumes the opponent has at least one 6, making the total count four. This is a reasonable starting bid as it is based on my hand and a likely assumption about the opponent's digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (from 43813220). To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 6s seems reasonable because I know I have one 6, and it's possible the other player has some 6s as well. Alternatively, bidding 4 7s is also an option as it has the same quantity but a higher digit. Given that I have no information about 7s in my hand or the opponent's hand, I'll choose to increase the quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s, and I have two 6s in my hand. Considering the maximum possible quantity is 16 and the likelihood of Player 1 having three 6s to reach the bid, challenging seems risky. However, since I only have two 6s, it's uncertain if the total meets the bid, making challenging a viable option.
