Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand (digits 0 and 0). Since the current bid is only 1 0s, I know there are at least two 0s in total. Therefore, I can confidently raise the bid to 2 0s, which is a strictly higher bid and well-supported by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 5, 4, 0, 6, 0, 9, 3, 8. I have two 0s and zero 1s. The current bid is 2 1s, but since I have no 1s, it's less likely there are exactly two 1s total, though not impossible. To avoid challenging on such a low bid, it's better to make a small safe raise. Since I have two 0s, and the previous bid was 2 0s before Player 0 switched to 1s, I can safely bid 3 0s, which is plausible given my hand and the total digits.
