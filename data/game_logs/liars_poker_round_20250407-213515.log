Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 42730110, I have two '0's, two '1's, one '2', one '3', one '4', and one '7'. The most common digits in my hand are '0' and '1', each appearing twice. Since I don't know the opponent's hand, a conservative and reasonable opening bid is to claim a total of 3 of a digit I hold multiples of, such as '1's or '0's. I'll choose '1' because it's a common digit and I have two of them, making a bid of 3 '1's a safe and sensible opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s, and the maximum possible quantity is 16. I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains 9 1s, I can make a valid bid of 9 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s, which is a reasonable starting point. Given the secret nature of the hands, it's difficult to make an extremely high bid. However, I can try to make a bid that exceeds the current bid by quantity or digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 ones. Looking at my hand (42730110), I have two '1's. For Player 1's bid of 4 ones to be valid, there must be at least two more '1's in their hand. While this is plausible, it's not guaranteed. Since half of the total possible '1's are already in my hand, the probability that Player 1 has two or more '1's is moderate but uncertain. Given the risk, challenging now is reasonable, as the bid might be a bluff or an overestimate.
