Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since this is the first bid, I can start with a reasonable quantity and a high digit. Bidding 2 9s is safe and sets a foundation for future bids.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 74402804, which contains digits 7, 4, 4, 0, 2, 8, 0, and 4. I have no 9s in my own hand. The current bid is 2 9s, meaning Player 0 claims at least two 9s exist across both players' hands. Since I have zero 9s, Player 0 must have at least two 9s to fulfill their claim. With 8 digits each, it's plausible Player 0 has two or more 9s. However, given that the bid is still low (only 2 digits), it is risky to challenge. I should instead make a slightly higher bid on a digit I have multiple copies of. I have three 4s, making it safer to bid on 4s. I will bid 3 4s, which is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have no 4s in my hand, so the total number of 4s could be up to 8. However, since I don't have any, the other player must have all the 4s. Bidding 3 5s is a valid higher bid as I have two 5s, and it's a safer move than challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 74402804, which contains the digits 7, 4, 4, 0, 2, 8, 0, and 4. I have no 5s, so I cannot confirm any digit 5 from my own hand. The current bid is 3 5s, meaning Player 0 claims there are at least three 5s across both our hands. Since I have none, Player 0 would need to have at least three 5s themselves. Given that Player 0 initially bid on 9s, then shifted to 5s only after my bid on 4s, it's plausible they might not actually have three 5s. With no information supporting this bid from my own hand, the claim seems risky and possibly a bluff. Thus, challenging this bid is the safest and most logical move.
