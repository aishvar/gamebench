Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. Since it's the first bid, I can start with 3 5s, assuming the other player has at least one more. This is a reasonable starting point.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have the digits 27914283, and I count one 5 in my hand. It's possible that the total count of 5s across both hands is 3 or more. I can increase the quantity or the digit. I see that I have a 7 and an 8, which are higher than 5. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and is based on the presence of 8s in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand, so the total number of 8s could be 1, 2, or 3. Challenging this bid seems risky, but given the uncertainty, I'll take the chance to test the claim.
