Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, two 8s, and one each of 0, 1, 2, and 9. A safe opening bid is typically 2 of a digit I have multiple of. I will bid 2 6s, reflecting the two 6s in my hand, which is a reasonable and conservative opening bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s and a 7 in my hand, but no 6s. The current bid is 2 6s. Given that I cannot support the bid with my hand, I should challenge it because it seems unlikely that there are at least 2 sixes in total between both players.
