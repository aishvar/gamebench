--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 01265843, I have one of each digit except for 7 and 9. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 of a common middle digit. I have one 5 and one 6, so bidding 2 5s is a safe and standard opening.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '2 5s' and examining my hand '05939677', I notice I don't have any 5s. However, I should consider the possibility that the other player might have at least two 5s or is bluffing. Since I don't have any 5s and the bid is relatively low, challenging seems like a viable option, especially considering the low quantity of the bid. It's unlikely that there are two or more 5s in total given the random distribution of digits and my hand not containing any 5s.
