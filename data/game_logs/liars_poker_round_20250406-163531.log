Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 6s, one 0, one 1, one 4, and one 7. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, reflecting my hand and leaving room to maneuver later.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s, and I do not have any 5s in my hand. However, it is reasonable to assume there could be at least 2 5s between both hands. To increase the bid, I can choose a digit I have in my hand to make a stronger bid. I have one 2 and one 7, so I will bid 2 7s, as it raises the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '74065156', I have one 7. Since the current bid is 2 7s, it's plausible that there is at least one more 7 in Player 1's hand, making the bid reasonable. To outbid, I can either increase the quantity to 3 or bid 2 of a higher digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s and two 6s. Bidding 3 5s is risky with only two 5s in my hand, but 3 6s is more plausible since I hold two 6s, and expecting one more from Player 1 is reasonable. Therefore, I will bid 3 6s as a higher and reasonable bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, meaning there need to be at least three 6s across both hands. Since I only have one, the other player would need at least two 6s to meet their bid. This is plausible, but not certain. To stay in the game and raise the stakes strategically, I will bid 3 7s, as I have two 7s in my hand, making it more likely that this bid is valid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s and two 6s. The current bid is 3 7s, which is plausible since I hold two 7s myself, so it's likely there is at least one more among the opponent's 8 digits. To continue strategically, I can increase the bid by either raising the digit or the quantity. Since I already previously bid 3 6s and have two 6s, bidding 4 6s is a reasonable and safe incremental bid, leveraging my strong hand in 6s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. Looking at my hand (38290472), I have no 6s, so I am relying entirely on the other player's hand to make up the count of at least 4. Since the maximum total digits across both hands is 16, and I have no 6s, the claim of 4 6s seems plausible but risky. However, increasing the bid to 4 7s is reasonable because I have two 7s in my hand, making it more likely that the total count of 7s across both hands is at least 4. This is a safer bid than challenging at this point.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s (digits '7' at positions 1 and 7). The current bid is 4 7s, so for that to be true, my opponent must have at least two 7s. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely, as the average number of any digit across both hands is about 3.2. Since the bid is already at 4 7s, pushing it higher would be risky unless I have strong evidence. Given that, and the fact that I hold two 7s myself, I think challenging is the best move because it's unlikely there are four or more 7s in total.
