Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s and one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 1 0s. Bidding 2 5s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit and quantity from the current bid. I could also bid 2 6s, but 2 5s is a safer bet given my hand.
