Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (89903041), I have two 0s, which is a decent starting point. Since there are no previous bids and I'm starting, I'll make a conservative opening bid of three 0s, assuming there's likely at least one more 0 in the opponent's hand given their 8 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand already. Itâ€™s fairly likely the other player has at least one more, making a total of at least 3 7s. This is a safe outbid on the current bid of 3 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 89903041, I have zero 7s. The opponent bid '3 7s', and since I have none, all 3 would need to be in their hand. While possible, this seems unlikely. Given I have no 7s to support their bid and it's early in the game, challenging now would be strategic rather than letting the bidding escalate with uncertain information.
