Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 2 7s is safe and leverages a high digit (7), making it harder for the opponent to overbid with the same quantity while staying within plausible totals.

Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7. Since the current bid is 2 7s, it implies the opponent is claiming there are at least two 7s combined. With my one 7, the opponent would only need one more, which is quite plausible. Therefore, challenging now carries a high risk. The next minimal valid bid is 2 8s (same quantity, higher digit). I have two 8s in my hand, making a bid of 2 8s very safe and logical.

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. Your hand has no 8s, so the opponent must have at least two 8s. The probability of them having two or more 8s in their 8 digits is ~18.7%, making challenging a high-probability win (81.3% chance).
