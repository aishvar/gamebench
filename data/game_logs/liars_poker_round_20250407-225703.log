Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game, so I need to start with a reasonable bid based on my hand. I have two 9s and two 0s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. A starting bid of 3 9s is reasonable, as it accounts for my two 9s and the possibility of at least one more 9 in my opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. For the current bid of 3 9s to be valid, Player 0 must have at least two 9s. Given the low probability of an opponent holding two 9s (approximately 19% chance based on binomial distribution), challenging is statistically favorable. There's an 81% chance the total 9s are below 3, making this a high-value challenge opportunity.
