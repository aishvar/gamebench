Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there are no bids yet. I have two 4s, two 6s, one 3, one 0, one 9, and one 6 in my hand. Given this, a safe opening bid would be 2 4s, as I already have two 4s in my hand, making this bid highly likely to be valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 2 4s, which I can safely increase to 2 8s since I know there are at least two 8s in total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, which makes it unlikely that there are many 8s across both hands. However, the current bid of 2 8s is plausible since there are 16 digits in total. I have three 4s in my hand, and the previous bids have focused on 4s and 8s. To increase the bid reasonably and based on my hand, I will bid 3 4s, raising the quantity while shifting back to a digit I have confidence in.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have no 4s in my hand, making it less likely that the total count is 3 or more. Challenging this bid seems reasonable given the uncertainty and the lack of 4s in my hand.
