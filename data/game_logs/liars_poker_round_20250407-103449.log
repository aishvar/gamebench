Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. The current bid is 1 0s, which is easily supported by my own hand alone. Since there are 16 digits total, it's quite plausible there is at least one more 0 in Player 0's hand. Therefore, challenging now would likely lose. The minimal safe move is to increase the bid slightly, for example to 1 1s, which is a higher digit at the same quantity and a valid next bid. I have one 1 in my hand, so this is a reasonable conservative increment.
