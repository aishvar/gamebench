Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, making it a relatively safe initial bid. Starting with a modest bid like '2 7s' is reasonable since I can confirm at least two 7s myself.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 6, 3, 8, 5, 7, 1, 6, 0. I have one 7. Since the current bid is 2 7s, and I hold only one, this implies the opponent likely has at least one 7 or is bluffing. Given the total of 16 digits, a bid of 3 7s is plausible but somewhat risky. Alternatively, I can increase the digit to something I have multiple of. I have two 6s, so a bid of 2 8s or 2 9s is not strictly higher, but bidding 3 6s would be a valid higher bid, increasing the quantity while choosing a digit I have two of. This is safer than increasing the digit on 2 7s to 2 8s, which is not a strictly higher bid. Therefore, bidding 3 6s is a strategic move based on my hand.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 73740249, which contains no 6s. The opponent bid '3 6s', implying they likely have multiple 6s or are bluffing. Without any 6s in my hand, the opponent would need to have all three 6s themselves, which is possible but uncertain. However, since I lack any 6s, raising the bid would be risky without concrete evidence. Given the uncertainty and the moderate bid, challenging at this stage is somewhat risky, but bidding higher on another digit where I have multiple instances is safer. I have two 7s in my hand, and I previously bid '2 7s'. Increasing the bid to '3 7s' is reasonable, as I already possess two 7s, and it only requires one additional 7 from my opponent.

Player 0 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (63857160), I have one 7. The current bid is 3 7s, which requires at least two 7s in the opponent's hand to be valid. This is somewhat unlikely but plausible. Since I don't have strong evidence to confidently challenge yet, and I can still make a reasonable higher bid based on my hand, the safest move is to increase the digit within the same quantity. I have two 6s, so bidding 3 8s would be risky, but bidding 3 8s is a minimal increment and puts pressure back on the opponent.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 73740249 and does not contain any 8s. The opponent bid 3 8s, implying they might have multiple 8s. However, since I have none, the opponent would need to have at least three 8s themselves, which is possible but uncertain. Given the risk and uncertainty, it's safer to shift to a digit that I hold multiple of. I have three 7s, making it reasonable to increase the bid quantity to 4 and bid on a digit I hold multiple of, such as 7.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 0 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (63857160), I have one 7. The current bid is 4 7s, implying there are at least four 7s among all 16 digits. Since I only have one, the opponent would need at least three 7s, which is quite unlikely given the distribution. The probability of four or more 7s overall is low, especially since I've seen only one myself. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
