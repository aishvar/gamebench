Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand 10776086, I observe I have two 0s, two 6s, and two 7s. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I'll start with 2 6s, reflecting my own count and leaving room to escalate.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (86103599), I don't have any 6s. The current bid is 2 6s, which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 2 sixes between our hands. Since I have no 6s in my hand, this means all the claimed 6s would have to be in Player 0's hand. It's certainly possible they have 2 or more 6s, so challenging immediately might be risky. I should make a higher bid. I have two 9s in my hand, so I know there are at least 2 nines for sure. I could bid '2 9s' which is higher than '2 6s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity. Alternatively, I could bid '3 5s' since I have one 5 in my hand, but this would be riskier as it requires Player 0 to have at least two 5s. I'll go with the safer option based on what I know for certain from my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '10776086', I have zero 9s. Since the current bid is only 2 9s, it's plausible that my opponent has two or more 9s, or that there is at least one in their hand. Challenging now risks losing if they indeed have two 9s. To maintain pressure, I can safely increase the bid to 3 of a digit I have strong holdings in. I have three 0s and three 6s. Increasing the quantity to 3 and choosing either 0 or 6 is strategic. Since 6 is already part of my initial bid and I have three of them, I will bid 3 6s to increment both quantity and keep the digit where I have strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (86103599), I have zero 6s. The current bid is '3 6s'. Since there are 16 total digits in play (8 in my hand, 8 in my opponent's hand), and I have zero 6s, that means my opponent would need to have at least 3 6s in their hand for this bid to be valid. While this is certainly possible, it's not guaranteed. However, I notice I have three 9s in my hand. I could safely bid '3 9s', which is higher than '3 6s' because it's the same quantity but a higher digit. This would be a strategic move based on what I know is in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 1, 0, 7, 7, 6, 0, 8, 6. I have zero 9s, so the current bid of 3 9s relies entirely on my opponent holding at least 3 nines, which is unlikely given only 8 digits in their hand. Since I have none, the probability they have 3 or more 9s is low, making the bid risky. Therefore, challenging is the best move here.
