Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is 1 0s, it's quite likely there is at least one 0 in total, possibly more. To make a strictly higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and bid a higher digit. I have two 7s, so bidding 1 7s is a strictly higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is supported by my hand. This is a safe incremental bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 3, 6, 6, 0, 7, 1, 2, 7. There are no 8s in my hand. The current bid is 1 8s, which is a minimal bid and quite plausible since my opponent may have an 8. Challenging now would be risky. Instead, I can make a safe higher bid based on my hand. I have two 6s and two 7s, so bidding 2 6s is safe and strictly higher than 1 8s, since it increases the quantity.
