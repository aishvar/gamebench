Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make the opening bid. Looking at my hand 51374816, I have two 1s, two 8s, and one each of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Opening with a conservative yet reasonable bid based on my hand, I will choose '2 1s' as there are likely at least two 1s in total (I have two myself), making it a safe starting bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. Bidding 3 1s would be a reasonable bluff, as it's a small increase and I have no information to suggest it's unlikely. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I *do* have. I have two 5s, two 9s, one 0, one 2, one 6, and one 8. Bidding 3 5s is a plausible option, as it increases the quantity. Since the previous bid was low, I'll attempt to raise the quantity on a digit I hold, hoping to pressure the opponent. 3 5s feels like a good balance between plausibility and increasing the bid.

Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 51374816, I have one 5. The current bid is 3 5s, so my opponent is claiming there are at least three 5s in total. Since I have only one, that would require my opponent to have at least two 5s, which is plausible but not guaranteed. To make a higher bid, I check for other digits I have multiples of. I have two 1s, so bidding 3 6s or 3 7s would not increase the digit. Alternatively, I could bid 3 6s or 3 7s, but that doesn't increase the quantity. Instead, I can raise the quantity to 4 and pick a digit I have at least one of. Since I have two 1s, bidding 4 1s is a reasonable next higher bid, as it's more likely there are at least two 1s in my opponent's hand, making four in total plausible.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. Bidding 5 1s would be a bluff, but potentially reasonable. However, I have two 5s. Bidding 4 6s is a safe option, increasing the digit. Bidding 5 5s is also possible, but slightly more risky. Given the history of bids, it seems like Player 0 is trying to bluff. I will bid 5 5s, hoping to force a challenge or continue the bluffing war.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 5S'
Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 5 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 51374816, I have exactly one 5. For the current bid of 5 5s to be valid, there must be at least four more 5s in Player 1's hand, which is unlikely given the distribution of digits. The expected average per digit across both hands is around 1.6. Having five or more 5s is quite improbable, so challenging is the optimal move.
