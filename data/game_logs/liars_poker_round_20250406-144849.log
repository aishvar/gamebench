Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 65837373, which contains two 3s, two 7s, and one each of 6, 5, and 8. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. Since there are 8 of us and I have 8 digits, I should consider the distribution. I have a total of 5 digits that are either 3 or 7. It's reasonable to assume that across all players, there might be a higher count of these digits. I'll start by bidding on 3s since I have two of them and it's a relatively high digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 6, 5, 9, 2, 8, 8, 4, 3. I have only one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 5 3s, which implies there are at least five 3s among all 32 digits. Statistically, the expected count of any digit is about 3.2, so 5 is slightly above average but still plausible. Since I only have one 3, it's risky to challenge now. A safe move is to make a minimal higher bid. I will raise the digit to 4 while keeping the quantity the same, making the new bid 5 4s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 5 4s

--- Turn: Player 2 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. My hand has 0 4s. With 32 total digits and only 24 remaining in other hands, the expected count of 4s is low (24 * 0.1 â‰ˆ 2.4). Total expected ~2.4, which is below 5. Challenging is likely profitable.
