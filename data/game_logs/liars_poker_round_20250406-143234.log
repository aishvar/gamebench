Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (85167012), I have 8 digits. The most frequent digit in my hand is not immediately obvious, so I'll count: 8 appears once, 5 appears once, 1 appears twice, 6 appears once, 7 appears once, 0 appears once, 2 appears once. The digit '1' appears the most in my hand, twice. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative and not too high. Bidding 2 1s seems like a safe and reasonable starting point as it reflects the count of a digit I have.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (39687085), I have no 1s. The current bid is only 2 1s, which is quite plausible given 32 digits in total, since on average each digit appears about 3 times. Challenging now is risky. I should make a minimal but valid higher bid. Since I have two 8s, bidding 2 8s is legal but not higher. Therefore, I will bid 2 2s, which is a strictly higher digit with the same quantity, a safe incremental bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 2s

--- Turn: Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one '2' in my hand. The current bid is '2 2s'. Since there are 4 players with 8 digits each, the total possible digits are 32. Given that I only have one '2', it's possible that the other players have at least one more '2' to meet the bid. However, the bid is still low, so I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Considering the risk of challenging a low bid, I'll make a slightly higher bid based on my hand.

Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 2 4s

--- Turn: Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have a 4 in my hand, but I also have other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 8 secret digits per player, I should consider the possibility of higher digits being more common. However, I also need to consider the likelihood of there being more than 2 4s in total. Since my hand contains a 4 and I have no information about other players' hands, I will make a conservative bid that is higher than the current bid. I will bid 3 5s, assuming that there might be at least 2 5s or higher digits in other players' hands.

Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. My hand contains one 5. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 6 and an 8 in my hand, and increasing the digit is an option, I can bid 3 6s. However, I should also consider the likelihood of the bid being true and the potential risk. Bidding 3 6s is a relatively safe move as it doesn't significantly increase the quantity, and I have a 6 in my hand, which gives me some confidence.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand, 39687085, I have one 6. The current bid is 3 6s. With 32 digits total, the expected average count per digit is about 3.2, so 3 6s is plausible. Since I have one 6, there only need to be two more among the other 24 cards, which is quite likely. Challenging now would be risky. A safe and strategic move is to increment the digit at the same quantity to 3 7s, as I also have one 7, keeping the bid pressure manageable without overcommitting.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. Given that there are 4 players with 8 digits each, the total digits in play are 32. The probability of there being at least 3 7s is reasonable, but not certain. Since I can increase the bid safely by raising the digit, I'll bid 3 8s, which is a higher digit than 7s and maintains the same quantity.

--- Turn: Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid can be beaten. My hand contains one 8, but I also have other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 8 digits per player, I have a total of 32 digits in play (8 digits * 4 players). The current bid of 3 8s seems plausible but I need to consider if I can make a valid higher bid. A higher quantity or digit could make my bid more competitive. I have 1 '8' in my hand, so I know there are at least 1 '8' in play. I also see that bidding 3 8s was just made, so I should consider if I can safely bid higher or challenge.

Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. My hand is 85167012, which contains one 0. This means there are 7 other digits across the other players' hands, and at least 3 more 0s are needed to fulfill the bid of 4 0s. Given the distribution, it's possible that the other players have the remaining 0s, but it's a bit aggressive. However, I can bid higher. I have one 1 and no higher digits in significant amounts. I can increase the quantity or digit. Bidding 4 1s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (39687085), I have no 1s at all. The current bid is 4 1s, meaning there must be at least four 1s among the 32 total digits. Given I have zero, that leaves four 1s among the remaining 24 digits. Statistically, that's unlikely, since the expected count is about 2.4 (24/10). Because the bid is already at 4 1s and I hold none, it's risky to make a higher bid, and challenging seems favorable here.
