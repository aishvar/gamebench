Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to make the opening bid. Looking at my hand 44236816, I have two 4s, two 6s, two 8s, one 3, one 2, and one 1. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I choose 2 6s, reflecting my own hand and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have a lot of 6s, I'll look at other digits. I can see that there's already a bid on 6s, so bidding on a higher digit like 7s or 8s could be a good strategy. However, I should first check if increasing the quantity is feasible. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, so assuming Player 1 has at least one 6, this bid is plausible. Bidding 4 6s would require there to be at least two more 6s in Player 1's hand, which is less likely. Given that I already hold two 6s, it's risky to assume there are at least two more 6s in their hand to justify a bid of 4 6s. Therefore, I believe challenging is the better move.
