--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand (24462370), the digit '2' appears twice, '4' appears twice, '6' once, '3' once, '7' once, and '0' once. The digits '2' and '4' each appear twice, which are the highest counts in my hand. Opening with a conservative bid based on one of these digits is strategic. I will start with '2' twos, which is a reasonable opening bid and puts some pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '2 2s' and my hand '74651925', I have one '2' and possibly another '2' in the other player's hand. Since the bid is low and my hand does not contain multiple '2's, I should consider challenging this bid or making a higher bid. However, without knowing the other player's hand, the safest option is to challenge the current bid, assuming it might be too high given the low probability of having exactly two '2's across both hands.
