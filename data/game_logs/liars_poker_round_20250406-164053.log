Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s, two 4s, one 8, one 5, and one 3 in my hand. Since this is the first bid, I need to start with a reasonable and safe bid. Bidding 3 9s is a good starting point because I already have two 9s in my hand, and it's likely that the other player has at least one 9 as well.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 86623165, I have a total of 3 '6's, 2 '8's, and other digits. I can see if I can make a reasonable bid based on my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, so I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 8s and two 6s, but no 9s. A reasonable bid could be to increase the digit to a higher number since I don't have any 9s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my hand is 86623165, I have a total of 3 nines. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 8 digits per player, I can safely assume that there are not many 9s in total. However, I do not have enough information to challenge yet. I will make a bid that seems reasonable and higher than the current bid. My hand contains two 6s, and I can see that bidding 4 6s could be a reasonable and valid move, as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, which makes it unlikely that there are 4 or more 6s across both hands. Since the maximum total number of digits is 16, and I know my hand contains no 6s, Player 1 would need to have all 4 or more 6s themselves, which seems improbable. Therefore, I should challenge the current bid.
