Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: For my opening bid, I should analyze my hand first. In my hand of 93084374, I have: one 9, one 8, one 7, two 3's, one 4, and one 0. Looking for the most frequent digit in my hand, I see I have two 3's. Since this is the opening bid and I know my opponent has 8 digits as well, making a conservative bid of three 3's would be strategic - I already have two 3's, and it's reasonable to expect at least one more 3 in my opponent's hand. This is a safe opening bid that gives me room to maneuver as the game progresses.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. Looking at my hand (68091862), I have the digits: 6, 8, 0, 9, 1, 8, 6, 2. There are zero 3s in my hand. Since I have no 3s, that means all 3 claimed 3s must be in Player 0's hand, which is unlikely given they have only 8 digits. Having 3 of the same digit in a single 8-digit hand is possible but somewhat rare (~11.7% for at least 3 of a kind). Without any 3s myself, it's statistically improbable that there are at least 3 total. Therefore, the bid is likely an overstatement, and the best move is to challenge.
