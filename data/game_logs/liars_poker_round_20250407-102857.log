Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 2s, one 1, one 4, one 5, and one 8. The most frequent digits are 2 and 3 with two occurrences each. A conservative but reasonable opening bid would be 2 3s, as it's quite likely there is at least one more 3 in the opponent's hand, making a total of at least 3 or even more. However, starting with 2 3s is the minimum opening bid and gives me a safe foundation.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 4, 1, 8, 2, 5, 3, 3, 2. I possess one 4. Since the current bid is 2 4s, and I have one, it is plausible the other player has at least one 4, making the bid reasonable. To continue, I can increase the bid by either raising the quantity or keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit. I don't have any 5s, but I have one 8, one 1, two 3s, and two 2s. The most strategic move is to bid 2 5s, which is a strictly higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Even though I have only one 5, it's a safe incremental raise without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 4, 1, 8, 2, 5, 3, 3, 2. I have zero 6s. The current bid is 2 6s, which means my opponent claims there are at least two 6s in total. Since I have none, all 6s would have to be in Player 1's hand, which is possible but not guaranteed. Making a higher bid without any 6s in my hand is risky, but I can safely increase the digit at the same quantity by bidding 2 7s, since it's a legal minimal raise and keeps pressure on the opponent.
