Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid (Current Bid: None). My hand is 51983764. I have one 9 in my hand. The lowest possible bid quantity is 1. Bidding '1 9s' is a safe opening bid, as the existence of at least one 9 is guaranteed by my own hand. This forces the opponent to increase the quantity to at least 2 for their next bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s, which is quite low considering there are 16 digits in total. I have two 7s in my hand, which allows me to confidently bid 2 7s, increasing both the quantity and the digit. This is a reasonable move as I can assume at least some 7s are present across both hands.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. My hand (51983764) contains one 7. For the bid to be true, Player 1 needs only one 7, which is statistically likely (over 50% chance they have at least one). Challenging this low bid is risky. I should make a higher bid. The next possible bids are 2 8s, 2 9s, or starting with quantity 3. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding '2 8s' is the minimal possible increase, is supported by my hand, and only requires Player 1 to hold one 8 for the bid to be accurate.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 8s. Since I can increase the bid by either raising the quantity or the digit, I can bid 3 7s, which is a valid higher bid based on my hand.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 3 7s

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (51983764). For the bid to be true, the opponent needs at least two 7s. The opponent previously bid 2 7s, I bid 2 8s, and they raised to 3 7s. This suggests they likely have at least two 7s, making a challenge risky. I should make a higher bid. Possible bids are 3 8s, 3 9s, or 4 of something. I have one 8 and one 9. Bidding 4 of any digit requires the opponent to have 3 or 4 of that digit, which is less likely. Between 3 8s and 3 9s, I previously bid 2 8s. Player 1 ignored this and went back to 7s. Bidding 3 8s again puts pressure back on them regarding 8s. It's a minimal increase and forces them to make a decision on a digit they previously avoided.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have no 8s in my hand, and the previous bids indicate a focus on 7s and 8s. Given that I only have two 7s, it seems unlikely that there are enough 8s to meet this bid, especially since the total count of digits is limited to 16. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
