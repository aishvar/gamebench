Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand 59282059, I have two 5s, two 9s, two 2s, one 8, and one 0. The most frequent digits in my hand are 5s, 9s, and 2s with two each. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 of one of these digits. I'll choose 2 5s to start the bidding.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze my hand and the current bid to make a decision. Looking at my hand (78847612), I have no 5s. The current bid is '2 5s', meaning Player 0 is claiming there are at least 2 fives between our hands. Since I have no 5s in my hand, all of those 5s would have to be in Player 0's hand. It's entirely possible they have 2 or more 5s, so challenging might be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have two 7s and one 8 in my hand, so I could confidently bid on either of those digits. I'll bid '3 7s' since I already have two 7s and only need Player 0 to have one more 7 for this to be true, which seems reasonable.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '59282059', I have no 7s, so the current bid of 3 7s relies entirely on the opponent holding at least 3 sevens, which is unlikely with only 8 digits. Additionally, I have three 5s in my hand. Since the current bid is 3 7s, I can safely raise to 3 8s or 3 9s, but a stronger move is to increase the quantity to 4 5s leveraging my strong count of 5s. This is a reasonable and safe higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (78847612), I have zero 5s. The current bid is 4 5s, meaning Player 0 is claiming there are at least 4 fives total between our hands. Since I have zero 5s in my hand, all 4 would need to be in their hand. While possible, this seems somewhat unlikely - they would need to have half their hand as 5s. I could challenge, but if they do have 4 fives, I'd lose. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding on 7s gives me confidence. I'll bid 5 7s, which is higher than 4 5s by increasing the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (59282059), I have zero 7s. Given that the total digits are 16, for the bid of 5 7s to be valid, my opponent would need to have almost all of those 7s, which is statistically unlikely. Since I hold none, and the bid is already at 5, it's improbable there are five 7s total. Therefore, the best move is to challenge.
