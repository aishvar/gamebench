Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my first turn. I should start with a conservative bid to test the waters. Analyzing my hand '45220356', I have a count of 2 for digit '2', 2 for '5', and 1 for each of the other digits. A bid of '1 5' seems reasonable as it claims there is at least one '5' in total across both hands, which could be true given my hand alone.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 five. Looking at my hand, I have one 5, so the current bid is certainly plausible. Since I cannot challenge a bid that is clearly possible, the best move is to raise. The minimum legal raise is either increasing the count of 5s to 2 or bidding 1 of a higher digit (6s, 7s, 8s, or 9s). Examining my hand, I have two 7s, making a bid on 7s safer. Therefore, the most strategic bid is 2 7s, which is both valid and puts pressure on my opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Analyzing the current bid of '2 7s' made by Player 1, I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is the best option. My hand is 45220356. I have two 7s in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and there are 2 players, the current bid of '2 7s' could be valid or not. I will count my 7s and compare with the possibility of Player 1 having more 7s.

Player 0 bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, which means that across both hands, there must be at least three 7s for the bid to be valid. Since I hold two 7s, the opponent would only need to have at least one 7 to make the bid plausible. Given the distribution, it's reasonably likely they have at least one 7 among their eight digits, making the current bid believable. Raising to 4 7s would require the opponent to have at least two 7s, which is less probable. Instead, making a minimal safe raise by increasing the digit to a lower frequency digit with the same count (3 8s or 3 9s) is risky without evidence. A safer option is to increase the quantity but switch to a digit I have more of. My hand contains one 5, one 2, one 3, two 7s, one 4, and one 1, so the best minimal raise is to 4 of a digit I have at least one of. The safest minimal legal raise is '4 7s', but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, I can bid '3 8s' or '3 9s', but this is less safe. Given that, challenging the current bid is risky because it's plausible. Therefore, the strategic move is to raise to '4 7s'.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (45220356), I see I have one '7'. The current bid is '4 7s'. If I bid '5 7s', it must be a valid higher bid because it has a higher quantity than the current bid. However, I should consider if challenging could be more beneficial if I think the bid is unlikely to be true. Given that I only have 1 '7', I must assess if there's a high chance the other player has more '7s'. Since my goal is to make a strategic move, I choose to bid higher with a digit I have, increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (45220356), I see I have one '7'. The current bid is '4 7s'. If Player 1 has 4 '7s' as they claimed, and I only have 1 '7', then together we can have at most 5 '7s'. However, I believe the bid of '4 7s' might be overestimated given that I only have 1 '7'. I will challenge this bid because I think it's unlikely they have 4 '7s' and I only have 1.
