Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have one 3, one 5, one 6, one 7, one 9 and two 0s in my hand. A safe starting bid would be to bid 2 0s, as I know there are at least two 0s in play. This is a conservative approach to establish a baseline.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 06123981, I have one 0. Since the current bid is 2 0s, for this to be true there must be at least one more 0 in Player 0's hand. This is plausible. However, challenging now is risky because 2 zeroes in total is quite possible. To make a safe higher bid, I look at other digits I have multiple of. I have two 1s (digits '1' and '1'), so bidding 2 1s is equal in quantity but digit is higher, making it a valid higher bid. This is a safe incremental move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 3 1s is a possibility, but I only have one 1. Increasing the digit is more promising. I have a 3, a 5, a 6, a 7, and a 9. Bidding 3 3s seems reasonable, as it increases the digit and is a valid bid. Bidding 2 2s would also be valid but less aggressive. I'll go with 3 3s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 0, 6, 1, 2, 3, 9, 8, 1. I possess one '3' and two '1's. The current bid is 3 3s, meaning at least three '3's across both hands. Since I only have one '3', Player 0 would need to have at least two '3's for the bid to be valid. This is plausible but not certain. A safer strategy is to increase the bid modestly, leveraging my two '1's to bid 3 4s or 3 5s would be riskier, so instead, I'll increase the digit to 3 4s, which is a minimal legal raise and puts pressure back on Player 0.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 4S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. Bidding 4 4s would be risky, as it's a direct increase in quantity without any information about the opponent's hand. I have one 5, so bidding 4 5s is a possible option. However, given the history of bids increasing incrementally, and the opponent's previous bids, I believe a challenge is more strategic. The opponent has already bid on 0s, 1s, 3s and 4s. It seems unlikely they have three 4s given the previous bids. A challenge is the best course of action.
