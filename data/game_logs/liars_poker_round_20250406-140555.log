Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can make the first bid. My hand is 41664360, which contains three 6s. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but not too low. Bidding 3 6s is a good starting point as it reflects the count in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '3 6s'. Looking at my hand (99548821), I don't have any 6s. The current bid claims there are at least 3 sixes across all players' hands. Since I have 0 sixes, all 3 would need to be in the other players' hands. With 16 digits between the other two players, it's certainly possible they have 3 or more sixes. However, I can make a safe higher bid based on what I know for certain: I have two 8s and two 9s in my hand. I'll bid '3 8s' which is higher than '3 6s' (same quantity, higher digit) and I know it's true because I alone have 2 of them.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 8, 8, and 6. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24, and there are already 3 8s bid, I should consider if I can safely make a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent. Since I have two 8s, I know there are at least 2 8s in total (including mine). If I bid 4 8s, it would mean there are at least 4 8s in total. However, I also have to consider the possibility of other players having more 8s or digits in general. A bid of 4 8s seems risky but plausible given my hand. Alternatively, bidding 4 9s seems impossible since I don't have any 9s. Therefore, increasing the quantity or digit seems reasonable.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand is 41664360, which contains one 8. Given that there are 3 players and each has 8 digits, the total number of digits is 24. The current bid of 4 8s implies that at least 4 out of 24 digits are 8s. This is a relatively low bid considering the total number of digits. I have one 8 in my hand, so it's plausible that the other players have at least 3 more 8s among them. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 5 8s seems risky as it requires the other players to have 4 more 8s. Instead, bidding 4 9s is a safer option as it keeps the same quantity but moves to a higher digit. This seems like a reasonable move given the information available.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand, I have two 9s. The current bid is 4 9s. Since I have 2 of them myself, there would need to be at least 2 more 9s between the other two players for this bid to be valid. With 16 digits between the other two players, it's certainly possible they have 2 or more 9s between them. However, Player 0 has already jumped to 9s as a digit after Player 2 bid 4 8s, which suggests Player 0 might have some 9s in their hand. I could challenge, but it seems risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 8s in my hand, so I know there are at least 6 8s total (my 2 plus the 4 that Player 2 claimed). I'll bid 5 8s, which is higher than 4 9s and likely to be true based on what I know.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I need to assess if it's likely or not. Given that there are 24 digits in total and 8 of them are in my hand, I can see if there's any possibility that there could be 5 or more 8s. Since my hand does not have any 8s, I have to rely on the possibility of other players having them. I should consider if challenging or bidding higher is more strategic. My hand has no 8s, so I have no direct information about 8s, but I do see a potential opportunity to challenge or bid very high. However, without exact counts of other players' hands, a bid seems risky. I should challenge if I think it's unlikely.
