Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Statistically, with 16 digits, the expected count per digit is around 1.6, so it's reasonable to assume there might be more 0s. However, since I hold zero 0s, I don't want to increase the bid on 0s. Instead, I notice I have two 7s, which suggests a safer path to increase the bid. I can bid 2 7s, which is strictly higher than 1 0s and leverages my hand's strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 29157374, which contains zero 8s. The current bid is 2 8s, meaning Player 0 is claiming there are at least two 8s across both hands. Since I have none, all 8s would have to be in Player 0's hand. While it's possible Player 0 has two 8s, the odds are roughly (combinatorially) about 8-10%, making it a risky bet to accept. Given the low probability and my zero 8s, challenging is the best move.
