Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 2s and two 0s in my hand, making the current bid of 1 0s very safe. Since I must raise, a conservative yet valid next bid is 2 0s, which is supported by my hand alone and increases the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 1, 9, 2, 2, 8, 2, 0. There is only one '1' in my hand. The current bid is 2 1s, which is plausible given there are 16 total digits and I have one of them. Making a higher bid is relatively safe. Since I have three '2's, a strong next bid would be 3 2s, which is a strictly higher bid (higher quantity and digit) and supported by my hand. This puts pressure on the opponent while relying on my strong count of '2's.
