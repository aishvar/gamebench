Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. Bidding 2 1s is a safe increase, as the digit is higher and the quantity is only slightly increased. It's also possible that player 0 was bluffing with the 1 0s bid, making it more likely that a slightly higher bid will be successful.
