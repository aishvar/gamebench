Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid of 1 9s is safe because the total count must be at least 1 (my own 9). This forces the opponent to either bid higher or challenge, which they would lose. It sets a low-risk baseline for the bidding round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s and no 9s in my hand. The current bid is 1 9s, which is quite low. I can increase the quantity while switching to a digit I have, such as claiming 2 6s, which is more likely since I hold two of them. This is a reasonable move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand. The opponent bid 2 6s, which requires at least two 6s across both hands. Given there are only 16 total digits (8 per player), the probability of the opponent holding exactly two 6s is relatively low. Challenging now has a high chance of success since even one 6 in their hand would still make the total count (1) fall short of the bid (2).
