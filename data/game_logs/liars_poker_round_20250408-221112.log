Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 2 ones in my hand, and since there are 8 unknown digits, it's likely the other player has at least one more 1. Starting with a small opening bid of three 1s feels safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 90474388. The current bid is 3 1s. I have zero 1s in my hand. Challenging is an option, as the opponent would need all three 1s. However, I have strong counts for other digits. I have two 4s and two 8s. Bidding 3 4s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires only one 4 among the opponent's 8 digits to be true, which is statistically very likely given I already hold two 4s. This is a safer move than challenging and puts the pressure back on the opponent with a credible bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, so I only need one more 6 from the other player's eight digits to reach a total of three. Raising the digit from 4 to 6 is a reasonable next step.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand (90474388). For the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least three 6s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, it's not guaranteed. However, challenging feels risky without more information. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid is strongly supported by my hand, as it only requires the opponent to have one 8 among their 8 digits, which is statistically likely (expected value 0.8). This forces the opponent to either challenge a likely true bid or make an even higher bid (like 3 9s or 4 of something). Bidding 3 8s is a safer and more strategic move than challenging 3 6s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand, so the opponent alone would need to have all 3. That seems very unlikely. I should challenge.
