Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a safe bid of exactly the quantity I possess. Bidding 2 7s is guaranteed to be valid (since even if the opponent has zero 7s, my two 7s meet the bid requirement). This sets a baseline while maintaining control with a mid-high digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. I could challenge, but there's a chance my opponent has a few 7s and is bluffing low. I will conservatively raise the bid to 3 8s, as I have an 8 in my hand and it's slightly higher than the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The opponent's bid of 3 8s requires at least two 8s in their hand to be valid. Given statistical probabilities and the risk/reward balance, challenging now has a higher likelihood of success as there's an 81% chance they have ≤1 8s based on uniform distribution assumptions. This outweighs the 19% risk of them having ≥2 8s.
