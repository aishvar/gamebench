Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I can start the bidding with a reasonable amount. Given my hand (50403385), I have two 0s, three 3s, and one each of 4, 5, and 8. I will make a bid for a digit that I have a strong presence of. Bidding '2 0' is a strategic move as it indicates I have at least two 0s, which is true, and sets a solid foundation for future bids.
