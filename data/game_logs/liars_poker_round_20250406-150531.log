Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 32591717. I count 1 '1', 1 '2', 1 '3', 1 '5', 1 '7', 1 '9'. There's a good distribution of digits. A reasonable starting bid could be on a digit that I have or a relatively common one. I have a '1' and it's a relatively low digit, so bidding on '1' seems reasonable. Starting with a quantity of 2 for the digit '1' is a safe initial bid as it doesn't reveal too much about my hand and is a relatively low quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one '1'. The current bid is 2 1s, so for that bid to be valid, there must be at least one '1' in the opponent's hand. Since it's quite likely the opponent has at least one '1' among 8 digits, challenging now is risky. The safest move is to increase the bid slightly. I can raise to 2 2s, which is a minimal increase by digit, keeping the quantity the same but moving to a digit I have one of in my hand, making it plausible.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I see one 2, it's plausible that there are at least two 2s in total. I can bid 2 3s, increasing the digit and keeping the quantity the same.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 40510658, I have zero 3s. Since the current bid is 2 3s, and I hold none, the opponent must have at least two 3s for the bid to be valid. That is somewhat plausible but risky. To avoid challenging prematurely, I can consider making a safe higher bid based on digits I do have. I note I have two 0s and two 5s, so bidding 3 0s or 3 5s is reasonable, since it's likely there is at least one more 0 or 5 in the opponent's hand. Between those, I'll choose 3 5s as my next bid, which is strictly higher and backed by my two 5s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 7 and one 1 in my hand, but no 5s. The bid history indicates a progression in the digits. I need to make a higher bid. Since I don't have information about the exact count of 5s or higher digits, I'll consider bidding on a higher digit. I can bid 3 6s or higher. Given that I have two odd digits (1, 7, and 1, 7) and no 6s, bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it doesn't commit me to a digit I know I have, but it's a relatively safe increase in the digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 4, 0, 5, 1, 0, 6, 5, 8. I see only one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, so to be valid, there must be at least two 6s in the opponent's hand, which is plausible but not guaranteed. Making a minimal higher bid is reasonable here to avoid challenging on a relatively safe bid. Since I have two 5s, bidding 3 7s is not safer, but I can increase the quantity instead. I will bid 4 5s, since I have two 5s myself, and it's likely the opponent has at least two more 5s or one more, making it a safer incremental bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. My hand is 32591717, which contains one 5. I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have one 5, it's possible that the total count of 5s is at least 4, but I'm not certain. However, I can bid on a higher digit. I see that I have two 7s, which could be a good candidate. Bidding 4 7s is a valid move as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '40510658', I have one 7. The current bid is 4 7s, meaning there must be at least four 7s between both hands. Since I only have one, the opponent would need at least three 7s for the bid to be valid. Given typical digit distribution, having three or more 7s in their 8 digits is unlikely. The total number of 7s being 4 or more seems improbable, so challenging is the best move.
