Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I need to make a valid bid. I have two 7s in my hand, which gives me a decent starting point. I will bid 2 7s, as it's a reasonable quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, meaning the current bid of 2 7s relies entirely on the opponent's 8 unknown digits. Statistically, in an 8-digit hand where each digit has a 10% chance of being a 7, the probability of obtaining at least 2 7s is about 18.7%. This makes the bid highly unlikely, so challenging it is the optimal move.
