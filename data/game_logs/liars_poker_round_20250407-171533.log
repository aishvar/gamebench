Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first move of the game, so I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand '51334402', I have two 4s, two 3s, one 5, one 1, one 0, and one 2. Since I have two 4s in my hand, there could be up to 10 more 4s in my opponent's hand (though that's unlikely). A conservative opening bid would be to bid on a digit I have multiple of. I'll bid '3 4s', meaning I claim there are at least 3 fours between both our hands. This is a safe bid since I already have 2 fours myself, so I only need my opponent to have 1 more four for this to be true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. I don't have any 4s in my hand. The maximum possible number of 4s is 16. Given the current bid of 3, it's plausible that there are at least 3 4s between both hands. I could bid higher, but I don't have any information to suggest a higher bid would be safe. Therefore, challenging seems like a reasonable option, as the probability of the bid being false is non-negligible.
