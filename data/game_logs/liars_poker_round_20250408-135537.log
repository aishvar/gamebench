Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s provides a reasonable starting bid, as there's a chance the opponent has at least one 7. This balances risk and potential for future bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 92219284, which contains digits 9, 2, 2, 1, 9, 2, 8, and 4. I have no 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, meaning the opponent claims there are at least three 7s in total. Since I have zero 7s, all three would need to be in my opponent's hand of eight digits. While it's possible, it's statistically unlikely for them to have three or more of a specific digit. Given the limited information, however, challenging immediately might be risky. Instead, I can make a relatively safer bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have three 2s in my hand, making a bid of '3 9s' or '3 8s' risky since I only have two 9s and one 8. However, I have three 2s, so bidding '4 2s' seems reasonable and safer, as it is a modest increase in quantity and digit based on my own hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have zero 2s, so the total count depends on Player 1's hand. Bidding 4 7s is valid (higher digit than 2), and I have two 7s. If Player 1 has at least two 7s, the bid holds. This shifts the challenge risk to them while leveraging my existing 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand (92219284) has digits: 9, 2, 2, 1, 9, 2, 8, 4. Thus, I have no 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, meaning there must be at least four 7s among the opponent's eight digits, which seems unlikely. Given I have none, it's improbable the opponent holds all four required 7s. Challenging is the prudent choice here.
