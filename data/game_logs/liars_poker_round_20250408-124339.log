Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. I have two 8s in my hand. A conservative bid would be 1 8s, but I can be a bit more aggressive. I'll bid 2 7s, as I have one 7 and it's a reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand (14431623) contains no 7s. The current bid is 2 7s, meaning my opponent claims there are at least two 7s across both hands. Since I have none, my opponent would need to have at least two 7s. With 8 digits per player, it's plausible but somewhat risky. However, bidding slightly higher with a digit I have multiple occurrences of is safer. I have two 1s, two 3s, and two 4s. I'll bid 3 1s, as I already have two, making it highly likely there's at least one more among the opponent's digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. Bidding higher than 3 1s is necessary. I have two 8s, so bidding 4 8s is a reasonable option, increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 2 7s, but that wouldn't be higher than the previous bid of 2 7s. Therefore, 4 8s is the best option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 14431623, which contains no 8s. The opponent has bid 4 8s, implying that there are at least four 8s between our two hands. Given that I have zero 8s, the opponent would need to have all four 8s themselves. While possible, this is statistically improbable. Therefore, challenging this bid seems like the best strategic choice.
