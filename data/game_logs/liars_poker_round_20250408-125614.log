Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so any valid bid is acceptable. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 1 5s is a safe and reasonable opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '5' in my hand, which already matches the current bid of '1 5s'. Given there are 16 digits in total and the bid is very low, it is highly probable there is at least one more '5' in the other player's hand. Therefore, increasing the bid slightly seems safe and strategic. However, I have three '9's, making '9' a strong digit for me. Bidding '2 9s' leverages my strong holding and keeps the bid conservative.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. I could bid higher in quantity with a digit I have, but challenging seems more strategic. 2 9s is a relatively high bid, and it's unlikely Player 1 actually has two 9s, especially considering my hand doesn't contain any. Challenging provides a good chance of winning this round.
