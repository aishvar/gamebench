Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I can make the first bid. I have the digits 7, 3, 5, 1, 9, 1, 7, 0 in my hand. I notice that I have two 1s and two 7s. A reasonable starting bid could be on a digit I have, to increase the likelihood of it being in the other player's hand as well. Bidding 3 1s seems like a moderate start, as it is a digit I have and slightly increases the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 70463358, I have zero 1s. The current bid is 3 1s, which implies my opponent believes there are at least three 1s across both hands. Since I have none, all three would have to be in their hand. The probability of one player having three or more 1s in 8 digits is relatively low. Therefore, it is a good opportunity to challenge this bid.
