Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. My hand is 75914508. I have two 5s, which is the highest frequency of any digit in my hand. Bidding '2 5' is a safe opening move because I hold two 5s myself, guaranteeing the bid is true based on my hand alone. This starts the bidding at a reasonable level, leveraging my strongest digit count.
