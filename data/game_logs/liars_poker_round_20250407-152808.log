Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 4s, two 0s, one 6, and one 7. A reasonable conservative opening bid is 2 1s, reflecting the two 1s I hold. This is a safe and truthful starting point that does not overcommit early in the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have one 1 in my hand (since my hand is 36584859). The total count of 1s across both hands must be at least 2 (one from my hand and potentially one from the other player's hand), so the bid of 2 1s is plausible. However, to make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I see that I have multiple 8s and a few other digits, but not many high digits. Bidding 2 2s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (14647110), I have two 1s, zero 2s, two 4s, two 1s, and two 0s. Since I have no 2s, the current bid of 2 2s relies entirely on the opponent holding at least two 2s, which is plausible but not guaranteed. A safer strategic move is to increase the bid modestly on a digit I hold multiple of, such as 1 (I have two). Bidding 3 1s is a reasonable next bid, as with my two 1s, only one more is needed from the opponent, which is quite likely.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 1S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand (since my hand is 36584859). The total count of 1s across both hands must be at least 3 to justify the bid. It's possible that Player 0 has two 1s, making the bid plausible. I need to either believe the bid or make a higher bid. I can see that I have a total of two 8s and one 5, which are relatively high counts. However, bidding on 5s or 8s would be a safer bet if I had more of them or if the count was higher. I can bid 3 2s, which is a higher digit than the current bid, making it a valid bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 2S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 14647110, I have two 1s and zero 2s. The current bid is 3 2s. Since I have no 2s, for the bid to be valid, my opponent would need at least 3 2s in their hand, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. The probability of them holding 3 or more 2s is quite low. Therefore, challenging is the best strategic move.
