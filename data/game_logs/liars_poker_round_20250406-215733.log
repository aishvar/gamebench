Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 2 6s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 6.

Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. The opponent has bid 2 7s, but since they are playing naively, they might not have any 7s. Challenging seems risky, but bidding higher than 2 7s without having more 7s in my hand is also risky. I have two 6s in my hand, so I can safely bid 3 6s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.
