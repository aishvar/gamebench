Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (64296915), I have two 6s and two 9s, which are the most frequent digits. Bidding 2 6s or 2 9s is a safe starting point, but to increase the bid's strength, I'll choose the higher digit, 9.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable next step, as it increases the quantity of the current bid's digit. If I had more information about the other player's hand, I might consider challenging, but with the current information, a bid seems more strategic.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, which supports the current bid of 3 9s. Since the bid is plausible and I can't increase the quantity of 9s without risking a challenge, I should increase the digit instead. Bidding 3 6s is not valid as it doesn't increase the quantity or digit. Bidding 4 0s is a safe option, increasing the quantity and choosing a digit I have in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, making it unlikely that there are 4 0s in total. However, I should be cautious about challenging too early. I have two 8s, so bidding 5 8s is a reasonable move, increasing the digit and slightly increasing the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, which means there could be up to 4 8s in total (considering my opponent's hand). The current bid is 5 8s, which seems unlikely given the maximum possible quantity of 8s. Bidding higher would require 6 8s, which is not feasible with my current hand. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best option.
