Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, two 5s, two 3s, one 0, one 8, and one 9. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be 2 of a digit I have multiple of, such as 2 4s or 2 5s, to reflect my hand strength and leave room for escalation. I will choose 2 5s as my opening bid.
