--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, one 2, one 4, one 7, one 8, one 9, and one 5. The safest opening bid is often the digit I have the most of, which is two 0s. Starting with '2 0s' is reasonable as it reflects my hand and sets a modest opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s and no 1s. The current bid is 2 1s. Since I have no 1s, the chance there are at least two 1s across both hands depends entirely on Player 1's hand, making it somewhat risky to challenge now. A safer approach is to increment the bid on a digit I have strong knowledge of. I hold two 0s, so bidding 3 0s is reasonable, as it requires Player 1 to have at least one 0, which is plausible.
