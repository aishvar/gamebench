Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It is the first turn, and there is no current bid. I have three 3s in my hand, which is a relatively strong starting point. Bidding 3 3s is a reasonable opening bid that reflects my hand and sets the stage for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I notice that my hand (08677655) contains no 3s, meaning that the entire count for 3s must come from my opponentâ€™s 8 unknown digits. The probability that an opponent randomly holding 8 digits would have three or more 3s is extremely low (roughly 3-4%). Given that the current bid of 3 3s is thus highly unlikely to be true, challenging is the most favorable move.
