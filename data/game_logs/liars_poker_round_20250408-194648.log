Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (62511835), I see I have two 1s and two 5s along with single instances of the other digits. Since no bid has been made yet, I need to open with a bid that is safely supported by my hand. I know I have at least two 1s, so claiming '2 1s' is very safe. This bid is low enough to be credible and allows room to increase in future rounds.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s and one 8 in my hand. The current bid is only 2 1s. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I examined my hand (6, 2, 5, 1, 1, 8, 3, 5) and note that I have only one 8. The current bid of 3 8s requires that the opponent’s 8-digit hand must contribute at least two 8s—a statistically unlikely scenario given that each digit has only a 10% chance per card. Thus, the bid appears overambitious, and challenging it is my best move.
