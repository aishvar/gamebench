Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is only 1 zero, and looking at my hand (24351084), I have one zero myself. Since I know there's at least one zero in my hand, the bid of 1 zero is very safe and cannot be challenged. To increase the bid, I can either bid 2 zeros or a higher digit with quantity 1. Given that I have two 4s, bidding 2 4s is a reasonable and safe increase that leverages my hand strength.
