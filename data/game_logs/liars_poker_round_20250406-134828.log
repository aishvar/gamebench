Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits 0, 8, 3, 7, 5, 9, 1, 2, all unique, so only one of each digit. A safe and standard opening bid is '2 Xs' where X is a digit I hold, as it's likely at least one copy exists in the opponent's hand. I'll choose 2 5s, as 5 is a common digit and I hold one.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. Given that my hand contains the digits 1, 6, 8, 3, 2, 9, 0, 5, I have a 5 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 5, bidding a higher quantity than 2 for 5s or any 6s or higher would be risky without more information. However, I can try to bid slightly higher on the digit 5 or bid on a different digit. The bid of 3 5s seems reasonable as I have one 5 and it could be that the other player also has a 5, but not two. Thus, increasing the quantity slightly seems like a good strategy.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 5. The current bid is 3 5s, so the opponent is implying there are at least two more 5s in their hand. That is plausible, but not guaranteed. Statistically, 3 of any digit across 16 cards is quite common, so challenging now is risky. A safe strategic move is to slightly raise the bid to maintain pressure without overcommitting. I don't have more 5s, but I do have two 1s, so bidding 3 1s is a legal raise (same quantity, higher digit), and likely credible given my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I need to analyze my hand and the bid history. My hand contains the digits: 1, 6, 8, 3, 2, 9, 0, 5. I have one 6 in my hand. The bid history shows that Player 0 bid 2 5s and then I bid 3 5s. Given that the current bid is 3 6s and I have one 6, I should consider if I can make a valid higher bid or challenge. Since I have one 6 and the bid is 3 6s, I should think about increasing the quantity or the digit. I have a total of 8 digits in my hand, and none of them are higher than 6 in quantity, but I do have a higher digit (9). However, bidding higher than 3 6s requires me to have more 6s or to bid a higher digit with a quantity that seems plausible. I will increase the quantity and bid on a digit I have, which is 6. However, I only have one 6, so bidding more than 3 6s seems risky. I will challenge the bid because I find it unlikely that there are 3 6s in total.
