Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to start the bidding. In my hand, I have two 2s, two 4s, one 0, one 8, one 9, and one 1. Starting with a reasonable bid based on my hand, I will bid 3 4s, as I already have two 4s and it is likely that at least one more 4 exists in the opponent's hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. My hand is 51537256, which contains zero 4s. For the current bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least three 4s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is quite low (approximately 3.8% in this case: P(>=3) = P(3)+P(4)+...+P(8) = C(8,3)*0.1^3*0.9^5 + C(8,4)*0.1^4*0.9^4 + ... ≈ 0.033 + 0.0046 + ... ≈ 0.038). Since the probability of the bid being true is very low, challenging is the statistically advantageous move. While I could make a safe bid like '3 5s' (as I have three 5s), the likelihood of winning a challenge here is extremely high (>96%).
