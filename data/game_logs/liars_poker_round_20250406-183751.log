--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (67129214), I have zero 8s. Since there are a total of 16 digits in play and I hold half of them with no 8s, all 3 or more 8s would have to be in the opponent's hand. This is highly improbable, as it would require at least 3 out of their 8 digits to be 8s. The likelihood of that is low, making it a good opportunity to challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
