Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I need to make the first bid. Given my hand contains digits 3, 6, 0, 2, 9, 8, and 0, I can make a reasonable bid based on the quantity and digit. I notice I have two 6s and two 0s, which gives me a good starting point. I can bid 2 6s, which is a reasonable quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '14746294', I have two 6s. Since the current bid is 2 6s, and I already hold two, it's quite likely there are more in total, or at least not unlikely. Challenging now is risky. The next minimal valid bid would be 2 7s (same quantity, higher digit) or 3 of any digit. Given my hand contains two 4s, two 6s, and two 4s, a safe incremental bid is 3 4s, leveraging my two 4s and hoping the opponent has at least one.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have a 4 in my hand. I can make a valid higher bid by increasing the quantity to 4 4s, as I have one 4 and the current bid only claims three.

Player 0 bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (1,4,7,4,6,2,9,4), I have three 4s. The current bid is 4 4s, which means there must be at least one 4 in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. Given that Player 0 previously bid 2 6s, they likely have some 6s and may not have many 4s. It is plausible they have zero or one 4, making the total 4s likely three or four. Since I hold three 4s, the bid of four 4s is borderline. The probability that Player 0 has at least one 4 is not very high, so challenging is a reasonable strategy.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor)'s bid of 4 4s.
