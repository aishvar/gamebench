Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 12029381, which contains two 1s, one 2s, two 3s, one 8s, and one 9s. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the count of digits in my hand. I have a total of 7 digits, with two being the highest count for any single digit (1 and 3). I will bid on the digit '1' or '3' since they are the most frequent in my hand. Bidding 2 1s seems like a safe and reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 1s at all, which makes the current bid of 2 1s somewhat plausible but not certain. Since I hold zero 1s, the entire bid relies on my opponent holding at least two 1s in their 8 digits, which is unlikely but possible. Instead of challenging such a low bid, it's strategically better to increase the bid modestly based on the digits I do have. I have two 8s, so bidding 2 8s is equal in quantity but a higher digit, making it a valid higher bid and shifting the focus to a digit I hold strongly.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 8S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (from 12029381), so there is at least one 8 in my hand. The total count of 8s could be 2 or more. Bidding 2 9s is a valid higher bid because it increases the digit. I have no 9s, but it's a reasonable bluff given that I have an 8 and the other player might not have many 9s either. However, considering the quantity is the same, I could also consider bidding on a lower digit with a higher quantity. Since I have two 1s and one 2 and other low digits, I might consider a bid that reflects a slightly higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Bidding 3 0s seems like a reasonable move as it increases the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. The current bid is 3 0s, which requires at least two more zeros in the opponent's hand. Since zeros are less common and I only have one, it's somewhat unlikely the opponent holds two or more zeros. Instead of challenging now, I can make a safer higher bid based on my strong count of 8s â€” I have two 8s. Given that, a bid of 3 8s (same quantity, higher digit) is reasonable and safe, as it relies on a digit I have good evidence for.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (from 12029381). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I don't have information about other digits in my opponent's hand, I'll focus on my own hand. I see that I have three 1s and one 8, two 3s, and other digits. Bidding 3 9s is a safe increase in digit. Alternatively, I could bid 4 0s or 4 1s as I have three 1s. Given that my hand has three 1s, bidding 4 1s seems reasonable and is likely to be a relatively safe bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 1, one 8, one 4, one 3, one 9, two 2s, and one 5. The current bid is 4 1s. Since I only have one 1, for the bid to be valid, my opponent would need at least three 1s, which is somewhat unlikely given typical digit distribution. Additionally, I have two 2s, making a bid of 4 2s more plausible than the current bid. Therefore, I will raise the bid to 4 2s, increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity, based on my strong holding of 2s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 2S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have the hand 12029381, which contains one 2. This means there are at least one 2 in my hand and potentially more in the opponent's hand, making a total of at least one 2. The bid of 4 2s implies that there are at least 4 twos in total. I have one 2, so the opponent must have at least 3 twos for the bid to be valid. While possible, it's a bit aggressive. However, I also notice that I have a good number of other digits, and increasing the quantity or digit could be a viable strategy. I can bid 4 3s, which is a higher digit with the same quantity, making it a valid and potentially strong move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 81843925, I have one 3. Since the total digits are 16, for the current bid of 4 3s to be valid, the opponent must likely have at least 3 more 3s. This is somewhat unlikely, as 3s tend to be evenly distributed, and having 4 or more 3s overall is not very common. Given that I only have one 3, challenging here is a strategic move to test the credibility of the opponent's bid.
