Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 80616135. I have two 1s and two 6s, which are my most frequent digits. An opening bid should ideally be safe but also initiate the game. Bidding '2 1' is a safe starting point because I hold exactly two 1s. This bid is highly likely to be true (it only requires the opponent to have zero 1s), forcing the opponent to either raise the bid or challenge a probable truth. Starting with a lower digit like 1 also leaves more room for future bidding compared to starting with 6.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Let me analyze my hand and the situation. In my hand (14808425), I have only one '1'. Since the current bid is '2 1s' and I only have one '1', for this bid to be valid, the opponent would need at least one '1' in their hand. While this is possible, I can see all my digits and know that 1/8 of my digits is a '1'. The probability of the opponent having at least one '1' in their eight digits is reasonable, making this a plausible bid. Since this is the first bid and it's relatively conservative (only claiming two '1s' out of a possible 16 digits), I should continue bidding rather than challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 2s' made by Player 1. My hand is 80616135, which contains zero '2's, two '1's, and two '6's. For the current bid to be true, Player 1 must hold at least two '2's in their 8-digit hand. While possible, challenging this low bid is an option. However, I have strong holdings in '1's (two) and '6's (two). I can make a safe bid of '2 6s' as I hold two '6's. A slightly more assertive bid, leveraging my previous bid ('2 1s') and my hand strength, is '3 1s'. This bid requires only one '1' from Player 1's 8 digits, which is statistically plausible, especially since they didn't challenge my initial '2 1s' bid. Bidding '3 1s' utilizes my hand's strength and increases the bid quantity, putting more pressure on the opponent than the safer '2 6s' bid or a challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Let me analyze my hand and the current bid of '3 1s'. In my hand (14808425), I only see one '1'. For the bid of '3 1s' to be true, Player 0 would need to have two '1s' in their hand. While this is possible, it's not highly probable. Looking at the bid history, Player 0 started with '2 1s' and later raised to '3 1s', which could suggest they're bluffing. Since I can see all eight of my digits and only have one '1', and knowing there are only 16 total digits in play, I think challenging is safer than making a higher bid that would require either more '1s' or moving to a higher digit.
