Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 7s, and bidding 2 7s seems reasonable as a starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 3, 3, 1, 5, 8, 3, 9, 8, which contain zero 7s. The current bid is 2 7s. Since I have none, the probability that there are at least two 7s among the remaining 24 digits is plausible but not guaranteed. However, it's early in the game with a low bid, and challenging such a conservative bid is risky. Instead, I can comfortably raise by making a minimal higher bid, such as 2 8s, since I hold two 8s myself, making that bid quite safe.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, which is relatively low. Given that there are three other players, it's plausible that at least one other player has an 8, making the total count at least 2. However, to be safe and increase the bid, I can bid 2 9s, since I have two 9s in my hand and it's a higher digit than 8.

Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. My hand is 10460354, which contains one 9. The bid history has been escalating from 2 7s to 2 8s to 2 9s. Given that I have one 9, it's plausible that there are at least 2 nines in total among all players. However, bidding higher than 2 9s is necessary to make a valid move. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about other digits, I'll consider increasing the digit. Bidding 2 0s is a valid higher bid because 0 is higher than 9. I'll choose this action.

Requesting action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have the digits 1, 0, 4, 6, 0, 3, 5, 4 in my hand, with no 9s. The bid of 2 9s implies there are at least two 9s in total. Given that there are 4 players and I have 8 digits, the remaining 24 digits are distributed among the other players. It's possible they have 2 or more 9s. Bidding 3 0s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity and changes the digit to something more plausible given my hand and the distribution. I have two 0s, so bidding on 0s is not entirely unfounded.

Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have two 7s in my hand and the bid history shows an increase in digit but not quantity. My bid of 2 7s was not challenged, so I have some information about the distribution of digits. Given that the previous bids were 2 7s, 2 8s, and 2 9s, and now 3 0s, I should consider the possibility of other players having 0s. Since my hand contains no 0s, I can safely assume that there are not many 0s in total. However, I should also consider that bidding too high could be risky. I will increase the quantity slightly and choose a higher digit than 0, considering that my hand does not have any 0s but does have other digits that could potentially be in other players' hands.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (33158398), I have one 7 and two 8s, but no additional 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, so for that to be true, there would need to be at least three 7s among the other 24 digits. Statistically, the expected count of any digit across 32 digits is about 3.2, making four 7s plausible but not certain. Since I have only one 7, and given the previous bids, it's risky to assume there are three more. Therefore, challenging now is a reasonable choice.
