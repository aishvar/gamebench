Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Starting with a bid of 3 8s. My hand has two 8s, so bidding 3 gives a plausible total count. Since it's the first bid, choosing a digit I have multiple of (8) increases the likelihood the opponent has at least one more, making the bid defensible. Bidding higher (like 4) risks the opponent challenging if they have few 8s, while 3 balances aggression and plausibility.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (32701720), there are zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, meaning there must be at least 3 eights across both hands. Since I have zero, all three would need to be in Player 0's hand, which is statistically unlikelyâ€”having 3 or more of the same digit in 8 digits occurs but is uncommon. Given this low probability and no evidence to support the presence of 3 eights on their side, the optimal move is to challenge the bid.
