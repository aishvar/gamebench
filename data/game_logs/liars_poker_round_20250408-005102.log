--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 7, and one 1. Notably, I have two 1s. Starting with a bid that reflects my best digit makes sense, so I will open with 2 1s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 1s in my hand. The current bid is 2 1s, which is relatively low, but since I don't have any 1s, it's possible the opponent has at least two 1s. However, the probability is not extremely high, so I will challenge the bid to see if they are bluffing.
