Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s. Since I hold 2 out of the total 16 digits, for the bid of 4 9s to be valid, the opponent must have at least 2 more 9s, which is somewhat plausible but already on the higher side. The probability of the opponent holding 2 or more 9s is not very high, making the total of 4 9s unlikely. Therefore, challenging is a reasonable strategy here.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
