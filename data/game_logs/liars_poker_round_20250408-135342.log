Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains multiple digits, specifically two 3s, two 5s, two 6s, one 1, and one 7. Since no bids have been made yet, starting with a conservative bid based on my strongest digits makes sense. I have two 3s, two 5s, and two 6s. I'll start by bidding on the digit 6, as higher digits can give me more flexibility later. A bid of '3 6s' is a safe opening, considering I already have two 6s in my hand and there are 8 unknown digits in the opponent's hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand (the digits 6 and 6). The current bid is 3 6s, and since I know I have at least 2 6s, I can confidently raise the bid. I will bid 4 6s, which is a valid higher bid by increasing the quantity while keeping the same digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 6s. The current bid made by my opponent is '4 6s', meaning they believe there are at least four 6s in total. Since I have two 6s, my opponent would need to have at least two 6s as well for their bid to be valid. Given the total of 16 digits and the fact that I already have two 6s, it's plausible but uncertain that my opponent has two or more 6s. However, I also have two 5s in my hand, which makes bidding '4 7s' or '5' of any digit risky without additional evidence. Since the bid is plausible but uncertain, and raising the bid higher would be risky without strong evidence, the safest move here is to challenge the current bid.
