Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (61998302), I count the occurrences of each digit. The most frequent digit in my hand is '9' and '3' with 3 occurrences each, and '8' and '6' and '2' with 1 or 2 occurrences. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the count of a digit that is likely to be relatively common across both hands. Since I have 3 '9's, I can start by bidding on '9's with a quantity that is a bit more than half of the total possible count across both hands, which is 16 / 2 = 8. So, a bid of 5 '9's seems reasonable as it is a conservative start.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have 1 zero in my hand, so the total count of zeros across both hands is at least 1. The probability of having more than 6 zeros in total is low. I should challenge the bid as it's likely too high.
