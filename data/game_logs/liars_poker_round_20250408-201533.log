Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open with an initial bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s and two 0s, which are strong starting points. Opening with '2 6s' is a reasonable conservative bid based on my hand, as I already hold two 6s myself.
