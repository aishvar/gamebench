Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains digits 1, 7, 2, 8, 7, 0, 3, and 9, each appearing exactly once except for digit 7, which appears twice. Since there are no previous bids, starting conservatively with digits I already have multiple occurrences of is logical. Digit 7 appears twice in my hand, making it a safer initial bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The opponent has bid '2 7s', meaning they claim there are at least 2 sevens between our hands. Looking at my hand (25298951), I have one 7 in it. This means the opponent's bid is reasonable - they might have at least one 7 in their hand. Since this is the first bid and it's relatively conservative, challenging would be risky. I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s and two 5s, making these good candidates. I'll bid '2 9s', keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value, which makes it a valid higher bid while staying conservative based on what I know I have.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. Looking at my hand (17287039), I have exactly one '9'. With 16 digits in total (8 per player), it is quite plausible that the opponent has at least one '9' as well, making the current bid of 2 9s reasonable. However, I only have one '7' and one '9', making it risky to increase the bid on these digits without strong evidence. Instead, I notice I have two '7's (digits 7 at positions 2 and 6), so bidding higher on '7's seems safer. Since the current bid is 2 9s, bidding 3 of a lower digit is valid, as increasing quantity takes precedence over digit. Given I already have two '7's, it's reasonable to assume at least one more '7' exists in the opponent's hand, making a bid of 3 7s a safe and logical next step.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand (25298951). The current bid is 3 7s, which means there would need to be at least 2 more 7s in my opponent's hand for this bid to be valid. While this is possible, I also need to consider what digits I have in abundance. I have two 5s and two 9s in my hand. Since 9 is higher than 7, I could bid 3 9s, which would be a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit). Given that I have two 9s already, I only need one more 9 in my opponent's hand for this to be valid, which seems reasonable. I'll bid 3 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is '17287039', which contains one '9'. The opponent raised the bid to '3 9s', implying they likely have at least one or two 9s themselves. Considering I have one 9, it's plausible there are at least two more 9s across both hands. Therefore, challenging at this point seems risky. Instead, I will make a safer higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, and previously bid '3 7s'. Since I hold two myself, bidding '4 7s' is reasonable, as it only requires two more 7s from the opponent's eight digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand (25298951). The opponent has bid 4 7s, meaning they believe there are at least 4 7s between both our hands. Since I only have 1, that means they would need to have at least 3 7s in their hand for their bid to be valid. While possible, this seems somewhat unlikely. However, I do have two 9s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 9s. I've already established a pattern of bidding on 9s, and my opponent keeps returning to 7s, which suggests they may indeed have several 7s. I'll bid 4 9s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit).

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 1, 7, 2, 8, 7, 0, 3, and 9. I have exactly one '9'. The opponent has progressively increased their bid on '9's, now claiming there are at least four '9's in total. Since I only have one '9', the opponent would need at least three '9's in their own eight-digit hand. While possible, it's statistically unlikely. Moreover, the opponent's incremental bidding on '9's might indicate bluffing or uncertainty. Given these factors, challenging the current bid seems the most prudent action.
