Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, two 8s, and one each of 2, 7, 3, 9, and 6. Starting with a conservative yet reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 8s, reflecting my own hand, which is a solid starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 7 and one 4 in my visible hand, but more importantly, I can see my own hand which is 23606774. It contains two 7s and no 8s. Given that I have no 8s, the total count of 8s can be at most 8 (since there are 8 digits in the other player's hand). Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. However, considering the digit, I can try to bid on a higher digit or maintain the same quantity for a higher digit if possible. Since I have a 7, which is higher than 8, and I can see there are at least two 7s in total (one in my hand and potentially one in the opponent's), I can consider bidding on 7s. But directly challenging or bidding on 8s is more straightforward. I'll choose to bid 3 8s as it's a safe increase in quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 27448396, which contains one 8. The current bid is 3 8s, implying there are at least three 8s among all 16 digits. Since I only have one 8, the opponent would need to have at least two 8s. While this is possible, it's somewhat unlikely because having three or more 8s in total is not very common. Given the risk of the opponent bluffing to push the count higher, I think challenging now is a good strategic move.
