Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s, two 9s, one 4, one 7, one 5, and one additional 3 in my hand. Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. A reasonable opening bid would be 3 9s, as I already hold two 9s in my hand, and it is likely that the other player has at least one 9 as well.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 9s

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 75890714, I have one 9. I also notice that I have two 7s, which could be useful. However, bidding 4 or more 9s seems unlikely since I only have one 9 and the other player might have at most 8 9s. A safer bet would be to increase the quantity or the digit. I can see that bidding 3 8s or higher would not be useful as there is no guarantee I have more 8s or 9s than the other player. But I can try to bid 4 7s as it seems reasonable given I have two 7s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s and two 9s in my hand, which makes the current bid of 4 7s plausible but not guaranteed based on my hand alone. However, I also know that there are 16 total digits in play, so it's likely that Player 1 has additional 7s, making the bid more believable. To stay in the game and maintain a stronger position, I should make a higher bid. Since I have two 9s, increasing the bid to 4 9s is a strategic move, as it keeps the quantity the same but raises the digit, putting pressure back on Player 1.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. I can see the digits in my hand but not the opponent's. My hand contains one 9, one 7, and no 6s or 8s or 0s or 1s or 2s or 3s or 4s or 5s. I have a 7 and a 9. The bid history shows that Player 0 bid 3 9s and then 4 9s. I should try to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 7, I can try to bid higher with a digit I have. The current bid is 4 9s, so I should bid at least 5 or higher quantity or a higher digit. I have one 7 and my opponent seems to have a lot of 9s. I will bid 5 7s or higher if I have enough digits to make it reasonable.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand, which already accounts for a significant portion of the current bid of 5 7s. However, given that there are 16 digits in total and I can't see my opponent's hand, it is plausible that there are at least two more 7s in their hand to meet the bid. To maintain pressure and avoid challenging prematurely, I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Bidding 5 9s is a logical move since I have three 9s in my hand, making it likely that there are at least two more 9s between both hands.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 5 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 7, 5, 8, 9, 0, 7, 1, 4. I have two 7s and two 9s, but no 8s or higher quantity of any single digit that could immediately beat the current bid of 5 9s by increasing the quantity. However, I do have a 7 and a 9 in my hand. Since the current bid is 5 9s, I can try to bid higher with a digit that has a possibility of appearing multiple times across both players' hands. Given that I have two 7s and the opponent's hand is unknown, bidding 6 7s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and digit compared to previous bids and utilizes my available digits.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s, meaning there must be at least six 7s across all digits. In my hand, I have two 7s. For the bid to be valid, the other player would need at least four 7s, which is plausible but not guaranteed. However, instead of challenging, I can make a higher bid. I have four 9s in my hand, so bidding 7 9s seems reasonable. This increases the quantity and shifts the focus to a digit I have strong representation of.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 7 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 7, 5, 8, 9, 0, 7, 1, 4. I have two 7s and two 9s. The bid history shows increasing quantities and digits. Given that I have two 7s and two 9s, and the last bid was 7 9s, I should consider if I can safely bid higher or challenge. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's, bidding 8 7s seems reasonable as it's higher than 7 9s and I have two 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 7s. In my hand, I have two 7s. For the bid to be valid, there would need to be at least six more 7s in Player 1's hand. This seems plausible given the history of consistent bidding on 7s by Player 1, suggesting they likely have a strong hand in 7s. However, I also have three 9s in my hand, and increasing the bid to 8 9s is a strong option since it matches the quantity but increases the digit, leveraging my own hand strength.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 8 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 9s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I must consider my hand and the current bid. My hand contains the digits 7, 5, 8, 9, 0, 7, 1, 4. I have two 7s. The last bid was 8 9s, so I need to bid higher than 8 9s. I can bid a higher quantity or a higher digit with the same or higher quantity. Bidding 9 0s seems reasonable as I have a 0 in my hand and it's a higher digit than 9, but I should check if I can increase the quantity or digit reasonably.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 9 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 9 7s. This means there must be at least six additional 7s in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. Given the total of 16 digits across both hands, this seems plausible but pushes the upper limits of likelihood. However, instead of challenging, I can safely raise the bid to 10 7s, as it is still possible there are enough 7s in total, and this keeps the pressure on my opponent.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 7S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 10 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 7s. Given that I have 2 sevens in my hand (75890714), I should consider the possibility of increasing the bid while ensuring it's valid based on my hand and the bidding history. Since my hand contains two 7s and I know there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the other player's, the maximum possible 7s is 16. The current bid of 10 7s seems high but I have no information about the other player's hand. I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 11 7s seems reasonable as it's higher than 10 and there could be more 7s in the other player's hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 11 7s, which means there must be at least 11 sevens across both hands. I have two 7s in my hand, leaving at least 9 more required in Player 1's hand. This is highly improbable since Player 1 would need to have 9 out of their 8 digits as 7s, which exceeds the maximum possible. Therefore, I should challenge the bid as it is very likely to fail.
