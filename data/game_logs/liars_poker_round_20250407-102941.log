Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. The current bid is 1 0s, meaning at least one zero across both hands. Since I already have one, this bid is certainly true. To raise, I can either increase the digit or the quantity. I don't have any 1s, but I have one 9, two 9s, one 8, one 4, one 3, one 5. Given that, a safe minimal raise is to bid 2 9s, as I hold two 9s myself, making it likely. This increases the quantity from 1 to 2 and changes the digit to a high number, which is a stronger bid.
