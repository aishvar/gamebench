Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand (74530259), the counts of digits are: 0(1), 1(0), 2(1), 3(1), 4(1), 5(1), 6(0), 7(1), 8(0), 9(1). The most common digits in my hand are those that appear once, so I will start with a conservative but reasonable opening bid. A good initial bid is 2 of a digit I hold, assuming the opponent likely has at least one as well. The digit '5' is a good candidate since I have one, and '2' is also reasonable. However, bidding '2 of 5s' is a safe standard opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. Since the maximum possible quantity is 16, and the current bid is 2, there's room for a higher bid. My hand contains no 5s, but I have 8 digits, and I can bid on a different digit. I'll choose a digit with a high quantity in my hand, which is 9, and I'll bid 1 9s, as it's a higher quantity than the current bid.
