Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game. My hand is 51433759. I have two 5s and two 3s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. A safe opening strategy is to bid a low quantity of a digit I hold multiples of. Bidding '2 5s' is a credible starting point, as I already possess two 5s, making it statistically likely that at least two exist across both hands (16 total digits).

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 2s and two 0s in my hand, which means I could potentially bid on either digit. The current bid is 2 5s, which seems low given that I have no 5s. I can increase the bid by either increasing the quantity or bidding on a digit I have. Bidding 3 2s is reasonable since I have two 2s and can confidently claim a higher count on that digit.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. My hand is 51433759, which contains zero 2s. For the bid of 3 2s to be true, the opponent (Player 1) must have at least three 2s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is statistically low (approximately 3.8% assuming random distribution). Since I hold none of the bid digit, the burden falls entirely on the opponent. Given these odds, the bid is highly likely to be false. Therefore, challenging is the most strategically sound move.
