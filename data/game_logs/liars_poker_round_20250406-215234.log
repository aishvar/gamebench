Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have the digits 5, 6, 1, 7, 2, 8, 4 in my hand. Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make a valid opening bid. A reasonable starting point would be to bid 2 of a digit that I have. I will bid 2 5s as it is a digit I possess and allows me to start the game with a credible claim.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s, which seems plausible given there are 16 total digits in play. However, I cannot challenge as the bid is reasonable, and I must make a higher bid. To increase the bid, I will raise the quantity to 3 and choose the digit 5, as it aligns with my hand and is a logical progression.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand, which contributes to the current bid of 3 5s. Given that there are 8 digits in total, it's reasonable to assume that there are at least 3 5s in play. However, to make a valid higher bid, I could bid 4 5s. This would increase the quantity while keeping the same digit, which is a safe move considering I already have one 5 and there's potential for more in the other player's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand, and the current bid is 4 5s. This means there need to be at least three more 5s in Player 0's hand for their bid to be valid. While it's possible, it's not guaranteed, and bidding higher would require me to make a less likely claim. Given the bid history, Player 0 has consistently increased the bid on 5s, which could indicate they are bluffing. Challenging seems like the best move to test their claim.
