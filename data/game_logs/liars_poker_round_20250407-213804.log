Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. I analyze my hand: 39244317, which contains the digits - 3, 9, 2, 4, 4, 3, 1, 7. The counts are: 1 (1), 2 (1), 3 (2), 4 (2), 7 (1), 9 (1). The most frequent digits in my hand are 3 and 4, each appearing twice. Opening with a conservative but strong bid, I choose '2 4' indicating at least two 4s across both hands. This is guaranteed true given my hand and sets a solid starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. It's unlikely that Player 0 has two 4s, but not impossible. Bidding higher immediately risks escalating the bid and potentially being forced to challenge a much larger, potentially truthful bid. I will challenge the current bid, as the probability of Player 0 having two 4s seems low given my hand.
