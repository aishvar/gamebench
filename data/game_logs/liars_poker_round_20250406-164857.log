Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is None, so I should start with a reasonable bid. I'll choose a digit that's not too common, like 9, and a quantity that's not too high, like 2.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 3, 6, 6, 8, 2, 0, 4, which contains zero 9s. Since the current bid is 2 9s, this means the opponent would need to have both 9s to make the bid true. The probability of the opponent having two or more 9s out of 8 digits is relatively low. Given that I have none, challenging is the best move.
