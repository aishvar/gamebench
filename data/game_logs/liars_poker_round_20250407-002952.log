--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Since I don't have any 0s, it's slightly more likely that the opponent is bluffing. However, 4 is not a very high quantity, and the previous bid was 3 1s, so it is possible that there are four 0s in total. I will play it safe and increase the bid to 5 1s, using the digit 1 since I have two 1s in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 1s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total, it's unlikely there are 5 or more 1s in play. I should challenge this bid as it seems overly optimistic.
