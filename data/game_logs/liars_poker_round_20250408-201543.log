Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening bid and there is no prior bid to challenge, I want to start with a conservative yet credible bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 5, one 6, one 9, two 8s, one 2, one 0, and one 3. The most frequent digit in my hand is 8, appearing twice. Statistically, it's likely that the opponent also has at least one 8, so a safe opening bid is 3 8s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 3 9s, so combined between both hands, there need to be at least three 9s. Since I have only one, Player 1 would need to have at least two 9s, which is possible but somewhat unlikely. Raising to 4 of any digit would be risky unless I have strong support in my hand. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s. Bidding 4 6s leverages my known digits and is a safer incremental bid than assuming there are more 9s. Therefore, I will bid 4 6s.

Player 1 bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 56928603, I have zero 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, meaning there must be at least four 7s across both hands. Since I have none, all four would need to be in Player 1's hand of 8 digits, which is statistically unlikely. Given that, challenging is the optimal move.
