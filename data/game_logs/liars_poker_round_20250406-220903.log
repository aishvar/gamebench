Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 0s, one 4, one 7, one 8, and one 9. The most frequent digits in my hand are 0 and 3, each appearing twice. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 3s, leveraging the two 3s I hold.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 3s in my hand, and with 8 unknown digits on the opponent's side the odds that there are at least two 3s in play are very low (around 19%). This makes the current bid of 2 3s highly unlikely. Given these probabilities, it is strategically optimal to challenge the bid.
