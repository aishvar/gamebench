Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand has two 4s. With 16 total digits in play, starting with a bid of 2 4s is safe because even if the opponent challenges immediately, the minimum possible count (from my hand alone) meets the bid. This forces the opponent to make a higher bid rather than risk losing on a challenge.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 9, 0, 8, 3, 8, 1, 5, 7. I have zero 4s, so the current bid of 2 4s relies entirely on the opponent's hand. Since each player has 8 digits, it's plausible the opponent holds two or more 4s, making the bid reasonable. Rather than challenging early, I will increase the bid conservatively by choosing a digit I have multiple of. I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s (increasing quantity and a higher digit) is a strategic and valid move.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, meaning the opponent must have all three. With only 8 digits in their hand, the probability of them holding exactly three 8s is low. Given the risk of the bid being a bluff and the high threshold required, challenging is strategically sound here.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) challenges Player 1's (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bid of 3 8s.
