Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (Random(meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor)), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0, which is a low bid. Given the Naive 50/50 player's tendency to be conservative, it's likely they've made a low bid. Since my hand contains a 0, I have a good chance of making a higher bid. I'll choose a high digit (Q) and a moderate quantity (4) to challenge the current bid and potentially take the lead.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0, which is a low bid. Given the bid history and the players' strategies, I should make a higher bid to increase the stakes. My hand has 3 zeros, which is a decent amount. I'll bid 5 0s to make a more substantial claim.
