Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 2s, and two 0s, which are my most frequent digits. Starting with a conservative bid, I will choose 2 9s, as it represents a realistic count based on my hand alone and leaves room for future bids.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s, which could be plausible if the opponent has one or more 9s. Since 2 is a low quantity and it's early in the game, challenging now is risky. A safe move is to increase the bid slightly. I also have two 4s, so bidding 2 4s wouldn't be higher. Instead, I'll raise the quantity to 3 and choose a digit I have some of, such as 4. Bidding 3 4s is a valid, slightly aggressive but reasonable bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 4s. It is plausible there could be at least 3 4s across both hands, but I cannot be certain. To stay in the game and increase the bid, I will bid on a digit I have more of. I have two 9s in my hand, and bidding 3 9s is a valid and strategic move since it matches the current quantity but increases the digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9 and two 4s. The current bid is 3 9s, which implies there are at least two more 9s in Player 0's hand. Given that having three or more 9s across both hands is plausible but somewhat risky, and since I only hold one 9, I think challenging is the best move as the likelihood of Player 0 holding at least two 9s is moderate but not certain. The safer strategy here is to challenge rather than escalate the bid.
