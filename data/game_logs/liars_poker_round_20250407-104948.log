Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must open with a reasonable initial bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, two 3s, one 1, one 2, one 8, one 7, and one 4. The most frequent digit in my hand is 3, appearing twice. Given there are 16 digits total, a conservative but solid opening is to bid 2 3s, reflecting my hand strength and putting some pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 3, one 1, one 3, two 0s, one 8, one 7, and one 4. So, I have one 4. The current bid is 2 4s, which is reasonable, since I have one and it's likely the opponent has at least one 4 as well. To outbid, I can either increase the digit at quantity 2 (to 2 5s or higher), but that's riskier. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 3 for any digit. I have two 0s, so bidding 3 0s is plausible, assuming the opponent might have at least one 0. Therefore, I will bid 3 0s, which is a valid higher bid and supported by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 31320874, I have one '1'. The current bid is 3 1s, so for that to be true, the opponent would need at least two '1's. Given that distribution and since '1' is not a particularly common digit in my hand, it's risky to assume there are three total. A safer approach is to challenge, as the odds favor fewer than three '1's between the two hands.
