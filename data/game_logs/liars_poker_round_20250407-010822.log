Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, making it a safe choice to bid on 9s. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid of 2 9s, which is supported by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand (18022467). For the bid to be true, the opponent must have at least two 9s in their 8-digit hand, which is possible but not guaranteed. However, challenging such a low bid early is risky. I have three 2s in my hand. Bidding 3 2s is a safe and valid higher bid, as I know for certain there are at least three 2s in total (my three). This increases the quantity and uses my strongest digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 2s. Since I don't have any 2s, Player 1 must have all of them. Bidding 3 9s is a strategic move as it's a higher digit than 2 and I can potentially meet the bid if Player 1 has at least one 9.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand is 18022467, which contains zero 9s. For the bid of 3 9s to be accurate, the other player (Player 0) must hold at least three 9s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-card hand is statistically low (expected number of 9s in 8 digits is 0.8). Given I have none, the burden falls entirely on Player 0. Player 0 previously bid 2 9s and raised to 3 9s after my bid of 3 2s. While this could indicate strength, it could also be a bluff, especially since 3 is significantly above the expected value for their hand alone. Challenging seems safer than making a higher bid like 4 0s or 4 2s, which would require Player 0 to have multiple of those digits.
