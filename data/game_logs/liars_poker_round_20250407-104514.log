Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. I could challenge, but the opponent is a naive 50/50 player, so they might actually have a reasonable bid. I will play it safe and bid slightly higher. I will bid 4 3s, since I have two 3s in my hand, and increasing the quantity is a safer strategy than trying to bluff a high number of a digit I don't have.
