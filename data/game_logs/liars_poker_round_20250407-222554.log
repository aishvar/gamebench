Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, which is a strong starting point. Bidding 2 7s is a safe and strategic move, as it's a low quantity with a high digit, making it less likely to be challenged without good reason.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. I could challenge, but there's a chance the opponent has some 7s, and there could be others in their hand. It's safer to raise the bid slightly. I have two 8s, so I can bid 3 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, making the total count of 8s dependent solely on Player 1's hand. Given that 8 is a high digit and less likely to be numerous, challenging the bid of 3 8s seems plausible. If Player 1 has fewer than 3, I win. The risk is balanced by the potential reward, considering the unlikelihood of multiple 8s.
