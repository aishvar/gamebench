Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative opening bid based on my hand. I have two 0s, two 1s, and two 2s. Bidding 3 0s seems like a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 0s. Since I know there are at least two 0s in play (my own), and the other player bid 3 0s, it's possible they have at least one 0. However, bidding 4 0s seems reasonable, as it increases the quantity based on the likelihood of the other player having at least one 0.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. I could bid higher, but it might be a bluff. Given that the previous player only incremented the bid by one, it seems reasonable to assume they don't have many 0s. I will challenge.
