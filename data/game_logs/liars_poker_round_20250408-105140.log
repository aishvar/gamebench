Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 7, and one 8. The safest opening bid is typically 2 of a digit I hold, but since I only have one of each digit, the most conservative and reasonable opening bid is 1 of the highest digit, which is 8. This minimizes my risk and forces the opponent to raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 71523840, I have one 8 and zero 9s. The current bid is 1 9s, which is plausible given there are 16 digits total, so at least one 9 is likely. To outbid, I can increase the digit at the same quantity by bidding 1 9s -> 1 0s, but since 0 is lower than 9, that's invalid. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 2 and pick a digit where I hold at least one, making it more credible. I have one 8, so bidding 2 8s is reasonable, expecting the opponent might have at least one 8 as well.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 71523840, which contains no 9s. Since the current bid is 2 9s and I hold zero, that would require both 9s to be in the opponent's hand. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely but not implausible. Rather than risking a challenge on an early low bid, a safer approach is to raise. I have two 8s in my hand, and earlier I bid 2 8s, so increasing to 3 8s is a reasonable and safe higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (71523840), I have zero 9s and two 8s. The current bid is 3 9s. Since I hold no 9s, the entire count of 9s depends on Player 1's hand. For there to be 3 or more 9s total, Player 1 would need to have all 3 or more, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. Therefore, it's a good spot to challenge as the bid is probably an overstatement.
