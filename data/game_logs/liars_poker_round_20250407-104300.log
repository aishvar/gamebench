Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the opening bid, and my hand contains two 0s, two 1s, two 8s, one 3, and one 4. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 of a digit I have multiple of, such as 2 0s or 2 8s. I'll choose 2 8s to start the bidding.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 2 9s, which means there must be at least one more 9 in Player 1's hand. Given the total of 16 digits, it's plausible there are at least 2 or even more 9s overall. Since I have one, it's risky to challenge such a low bid. The minimal safe overbid is either 3 0s or 3 9s. I have two 0s, so bidding 3 0s leverages my hand strength and is a reasonable incremental bid.
