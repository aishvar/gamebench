Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make an opening bid. I should choose a digit and quantity that is likely to be present but not too high as to invite an immediate challenge. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding one 9 seems reasonable. I will bid one '9'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a low bid. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding one 9 is a safe starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 65408597, I have one '9'. The current bid is 1 nine, which is consistent with my hand alone. Since there are 16 digits total and I have one nine, it's plausible there could be more nines in the opponent's hand. Therefore, the bid of 1 nine is reasonable, and I should consider making a higher bid. The next valid bid can be either increasing the count to 2 nines or bidding at least 1 zero (since digit order increases). I have one zero in my hand, so bidding 1 zero is safe and a minimal raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one '9' (the last digit). The current bid is 1 nine, which is fully supported by my hand alone, making it plausible. Since I must either increase the bid or challenge, and challenging a minimum bid supported by my hand is unwise, I will raise the bid. The safest incremental bid is 1 zero, which is the next digit up. My hand contains one zero, so bidding 1 zero is also plausible and legal, exceeding the current bid by digit order.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 3/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one '9' digit. Since the current bid is '1 9s', there is at least one '9' (mine), and possibly more in Player 0's hand. It is quite plausible Player 0 has at least one '9', making the total at least 2. Therefore, challenging now is risky. A safe strategic move is to increase the bid slightly to '2 9s', which is a minimal legal raise and keeps pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. It's plausible that there are at least two 9s in total. However, to play strategically, I should increase the bid to something more believable but still potentially incorrect. Bidding 3 9s seems like a reasonable increase that might be accepted. Alternatively, I could bid a higher quantity of a different number. Since I have a 4, I could bid 3 4s. However, increasing the quantity of 9s is a safer bet. I will bid 3 9s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (65408597), I have one '9'. The current bid is 3 nines, which means across both hands there must be at least three 9s. Since I only have one, Player 0 would need to have at least two 9s for the bid to be valid. The probability that Player 0 has two or more 9s in their 8 digits is relatively low, especially since 9s are just one of ten digits. Given this, the bid of 3 nines is likely an overbid, making it a good opportunity to challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
