Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 0 in my hand (from 30155389), so there is at least one 0 in total. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have information about other digits, I'll start by increasing the digit. Bidding 1 1s is a reasonable next step as it is a valid higher bid.
