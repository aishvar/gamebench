Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 8s, two 4s, one 5, and one 6. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 7s, since I hold two myself, making it likely there are at least two in total.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s and two 8s. The current bid is 2 8s, which I already meet entirely with my own hand, making it very likely that the total count of 8s is at least 2, possibly more. Therefore, challenging now would be unwise. A natural next bid is to increase the quantity to 3 for either 7s or 8s. Since I have two 8s and the opponent likely has at least one 8 to confidently bid 2 8s, bidding 3 8s is safe and logical.
