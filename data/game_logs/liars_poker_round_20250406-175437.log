Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I don't have any 1s in my hand. Since the other player is Naive 50/50, they might be bluffing. However, I don't have strong reason to believe they are. I can safely raise the bid to 3 2s. I don't have any 2s, but it's a relatively safe bid.
