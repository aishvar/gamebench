Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Since I must make a strictly higher bid, I can either increase the quantity to 2 of any digit or keep the quantity at 1 but increase the digit. I notice I have two 1s in my hand, making '2 1s' a safe and natural higher bid supported by my hand.
