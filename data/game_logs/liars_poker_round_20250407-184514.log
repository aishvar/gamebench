Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid and there is no current bid to exceed, I can start with the lowest possible digit count. Observing my hand, the digit '1' appears twice, which is a safe starting point as it's likely to be present in the opponent's hand as well, making it harder to challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have zero 1s in my hand. It's unlikely there are two 1s in total across both hands. While it's possible, it's a good opportunity to challenge, as a failed challenge means I lose nothing but a turn, while a successful challenge immediately wins me the round. Bidding higher would be risky as I have no 1s and could be forced to continue raising or eventually call a bluff I can't support.
