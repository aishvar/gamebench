Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I need to make the first bid. My hand contains 0,3,2,4,0,9,8,9. Let's count the occurrences of each digit. 0 appears twice, 2 once, 3 once, 4 once, 8 once, 9 twice. The digits 0 and 9 are the most frequent in my hand. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, starting with a low bid is safer. Bidding 2 0s could be a good start because I have two 0s, and there might be more in the opponent's hand. Alternatively, 2 9s is also possible. However, starting with the lowest digit (0) might be better strategically, as it gives less information. So, I'll bid 2 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s and one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 2 0s, which is quite low considering I have higher digits. I can bid 3 4s, which is a valid higher bid both in terms of quantity and digit.
