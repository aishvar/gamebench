Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, two 1s, one 3, one 4, two 7s, and one 5. A safe and standard opening bid is usually 2 of a digit I have at least one or two of. Given I have two 7s, bidding 2 7s is a reasonable and conservative opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7 and zero 8s. The current bid is 2 8s, which is plausible since I have none, but my opponent could have up to two 8s. However, it's risky to challenge at this low level. A safe incremental bid is 3 7s, because I have one 7, so it's reasonable to expect my opponent might have two more 7s among their eight digits. This raises the quantity, keeping the digit manageable, and puts pressure back on the opponent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 31640775, which contains zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, meaning there must be at least three 8s total between both hands. Since I have none, Player 1 would need to have all three 8s in their hand of eight digits. While possible, it's relatively unlikely to have exactly three 8s in a single hand, especially since no 8s have been bid before Player 1's last two bids. Given this improbability, challenging is the optimal move.
