Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two 9s in my hand, I can start with a conservative bid to set the tone. Bidding 2 9s is based on my hand and leaves room for the opponent to respond.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (84274092), I have two 9s. The current bid is 2 9s, which means the opponent is claiming there are at least two 9s in total. Since I already hold two 9s myself, the bid is certainly valid. Raising the bid to 3 9s is reasonable, as it's likely the opponent has at least one 9, but even if not, my holding makes this bid plausible and strategic.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which is only one more than what I have. Given that there are 16 digits in total, it's plausible that the opponent has at least one more 9. Therefore, I will increase the bid to 4 9s to stay competitive.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s. The current bid is 4 9s, which would require my opponent to have at least two 9s as well. The probability of that is moderate but not guaranteed. Bidding 5 9s would be risky unless I have more 9s myself. Alternatively, I can consider raising the quantity with a lower digit where I have a strong count. I have three 0s (digits: 8,4,2,7,4,0,9,2), so bidding 5 0s would require my opponent to have at least two 0s, which is unlikely. For other digits, my counts are insufficient. Given the riskiness of a higher bid and the current bid already being borderline plausible, I think it's a good spot to challenge.
