Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Since I'm the first to bid, I can choose any quantity and digit. Bidding 3 3s seems reasonable, assuming the other player has at least one 3.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 3s in my hand, so I’m not sure if the opponent can have three 3s. Instead of challenging, I’ll raise the digit to one I hold multiples of. I have two 6s, so bidding 3 6s is relatively safe; I only need the opponent to have one 6.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, so the total count could be two or three. Challenging this bid is a calculated risk, as if the total is two, the bid is invalid, and I win. If the total is three or more, I lose. Given the uncertainty, challenging seems like a strategic move.
