Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (48381925), I have two 8s. Bidding 2 8s is a reasonable starting point, as it is the highest digit I have multiple of and sets a baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 8s. Since I can confirm at least one 8 exists, I can safely bid higher. I will bid 3 8s, which is a valid higher bid by increasing the quantity while keeping the same digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 8s. Since I only have two 8s, it's unlikely there is a third 8 in the other player's hand. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
