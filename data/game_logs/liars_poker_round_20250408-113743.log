Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. I have two 7s in my hand. A conservative bid would be 1 7s, but to be slightly more aggressive and potentially discourage an early challenge, I will bid 2 7s. This is a reasonable starting point given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have two 6s and one 7 in my hand. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 4 7s is a valid and reasonable next step, as it increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same. I don't have enough of any other digit to confidently bid higher with a different digit, and challenging seems risky given I have some 7s myself.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 7s, I should increase the quantity or the digit to make a valid higher bid. My hand contains a 9, so I can make a bid with a higher digit. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 6 7s is a logical next step, increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have one 8, one 9, one 0, one 1, one 2 and two 5s. Bidding 2 8s or 1 9s would be valid, but 6 7s seems the most reasonable given the recent bidding history focused on 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. Given the increasing quantity of 7s in each bid, I should bid a higher quantity of 7s. Since I have a 7 in my hand, I can reasonably bid 7 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. While I could bid higher on 7s, it's risky as the opponent has already bid aggressively on this digit. Bidding on a different digit seems more strategic. I have a 5 in my hand. Bidding 1 8s is a safe, minimal increase, and could potentially succeed if the opponent doesn't have many 8s. Bidding 1 8s is a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 1 8S'
Parse Error: Bid 1 8s is not higher than current bid 7 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. It's unlikely the opponent has enough 7s to make this bid valid. Challenging seems like the best course of action, as the bid is quite high and I don't have enough 7s to confidently raise it.
