--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have two 8s in my hand. I could bid 3 0s, which is a higher quantity and resets the digit. It's also plausible that there are at least three 0s in total. Alternatively, I could bid 3 9s. Given the naive player bid 2 9s, it is possible they don't have any 9s. However, I will bid 3 0s. It's safer than assuming they have no 9s and bidding 3 9s.
