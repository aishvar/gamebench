Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 78057148, I have two 7s, two 8s, two 1s, and two 0s. A safe opening bid would be 2 of any of these digits. Starting with 2 7s leverages my own hand strength and is a reasonable conservative opening.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s and one 7. The current bid is 2 8s, which I can already fully account for myself. Since there are 8 unknown digits in the opponent's hand, it's quite likely there are more 8s. Therefore, challenging now is risky. The safest move is to increment the quantity to 3 8s, which is a reasonable and minimal higher bid consistent with my hand.
