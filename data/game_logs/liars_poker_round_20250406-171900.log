Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable bid based on my hand. I have two 8s, so I'll bid a small number of 8s to start.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 2 8s

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider my hand and the possibility of having a higher quantity or digit. My hand contains the digits 5, 9, 6, 4, 5, 8, 7, 1. I have two 5s and two 8s are already bid, so I should think about increasing the quantity or the digit. A bid of 3 8s seems reasonable as I have one 8 and can reasonably assume Player 0 might have one as well, but I don't have enough information to be sure of higher digits in their hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 4 8s is a safe increase.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more likely to succeed. My hand contains the digits 5, 9, 6, 4, 5, 8, 7, 1. I have one 8, so I know there are at least 5 8s in total (since Player 0 has already bid 4 8s). Given this, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems risky without more information. However, I can try to bid higher with a different digit. Since I have two 5s and the current bid is 4 8s, I could bid 5 5s as there are only 16 digits in total and my hand has two 5s, making it plausible that there are not enough 8s but enough 5s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Bidding higher on 5s is risky. I could bid 6 of another digit, but I don't have a strong read on what's likely. Given the bid history focused on 8s, and the current bid being relatively low, I will bid a slightly higher quantity of 8s, since there have been multiple bids on 8s already. I'll bid 6 8s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 8S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 5, 9, 6, 4, 5, 8, 7, 1. I have no 8s, but I do have a 5 and other digits. Given that the bid is 6 8s, I must consider if I can reasonably make a higher bid or if challenging is the best option. Since I don't have any 8s, I should focus on a digit I have. I have two 5s and other digits, so bidding 7 5s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit compared to the previous bids, but I must ensure it's higher than the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 5S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Bidding higher on 5s seems risky. I have two 8s, and the bidding history shows a lot of 8s already. I could bid 8 5s, but I think challenging is a better option. It's possible there are fewer than 7 fives.
