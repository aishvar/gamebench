Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 2s, one 6, one 7, one 0, and one 3. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will choose a digit I have multiple of. I have two 8s, so a bid of 2 8s is a solid start, reflecting my hand strength and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (09670492), so the total count of 8s is at least 1. The bid of 2 8s is plausible but I need to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. Since I have some information about my hand and the bid is not extremely high, I will analyze further. I can see that I have digits that could potentially be part of a higher bid. For instance, I have two 0s and two 9s/7s which are higher or could be used to make a higher bid. However, making a bid just slightly higher than 2 8s, like 3 8s, is a reasonable move because it doesn't commit me to a very high quantity. Given that I have one 8, it's possible the other player has at least one 8 as well, making 2 8s a potentially correct or underbid count. Bidding 3 8s is a cautious increase.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 8s (digits: 62708382). The current bid is 3 8s, which I fully account for myself. Since the opponent likely has zero or at most one 8, a bid of 4 8s would be risky and probably false. Given that I hold three 8s, the claim of at least three is plausible, so challenging now is risky. To stay in the game without overcommitting, I can make a minimal higher bid, such as 3 9s, increasing the digit but keeping the quantity the same, which is safer than increasing quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I can see my own hand: 09670492. I have one 9 in my hand. The total count of 9s across both hands must be at least 1 (mine) plus some unknown number from the opponent's hand. Since the bid is for at least 3 nines, and I have 1 nine, my opponent must have at least 2 nines for the bid to be valid. It's possible but not certain. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Bidding 4 9s seems too high because it requires my opponent to have 3 nines, which is unlikely but not impossible. However, I can bid 3 with a higher digit or increase the quantity. Bidding 4 0s is a safer option as it increases the quantity and changes the digit to 0, which is lower than 9 but still a valid bid. I have 2 zeros in my hand, so it's plausible that together we have at least 4 zeros.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 6, 2, 7, 0, 8, 3, 8, 2. I have one 0. The current bid is 4 zeros, so the opponent is claiming there are at least three more zeros in their hand, which is unlikely given the total of 16 digits. Typically, zeros are less frequent, and having 4 or more in total is not common. Given I only hold one zero, it's a risky bid to accept, so challenging is the best option.
