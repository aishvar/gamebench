Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. I could bid higher on 1s, but I'm not confident. I could also bid on a different digit. I have two 6s and two 7s. I will conservatively bid 3 6s, which is higher than 2 1s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 4 7s seems reasonable, as it's only a small increase and I have some information about the digit.

Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 4 8s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. The previous bids have been relatively low, suggesting a conservative play style from my opponent. Bidding higher than 4 8s requires me to increase either the quantity or the digit. I could bid 5 of any digit or 4 of 9. Given the conservative bidding so far, it's unlikely my opponent has a significant number of 8s. However, I have two 7s in my hand and my opponent bid 4 7s previously, so they might be bluffing. I will bid slightly higher to test them. I will bid 5 0s, as 0 has already been bid and I have one in my hand.
