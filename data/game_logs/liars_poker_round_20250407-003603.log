Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits 6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 2, 9, and 6. Notably, I have two 6s. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I will bid 2 6s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 6s. Since there are only 16 digits in total and I only have one 6, it's unlikely there are two 6s in total. However, to keep the game moving and avoid an immediate challenge, I can increase the bid by raising the quantity to 3, which is a reasonable step up. This assumes there might be another 6 in the other player's hand.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, so for the current bid of 3 6s to be valid, the opponent would need at least one 6, which is plausible. Making a higher bid is reasonable here. Since I already hold two 6s, bidding 4 6s is a safe incremental increase that pressures the opponent while remaining likely.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s, which means there must be at least three more 6s in the other player's hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and the other player has already bid 4 6s, it's unlikely they have more than one 6. Bidding higher seems risky, so I should challenge.
