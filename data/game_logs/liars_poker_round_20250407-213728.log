Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I can start the bidding with any digit and quantity. I will choose to bid on '2' and say there are 1 of that digit across both hands. This is a conservative bid that I believe is safe, as I hold two '2's in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 '2's across both hands. Looking at my hand (60861491), I have zero '2's. Since the total digits between both players are 16, and I have none, the opponent must have at least one '2' for their bid to be valid. A single '2' in their hand is quite plausible, so challenging now would be risky. Instead, I can safely make a minimal higher bid. The next valid bids are either increasing the quantity to 2 of any digit, or 1 of a higher digit than 2. Looking at my hand, I have two '1's, two '0's, one '3', one '4', one '6', one '8', and one '9'. I have two '1's, so bidding 2 '1's is both safe and minimal. This is a valid increase over 1 '2's.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 1s', meaning Player 1 claims there are at least 2 occurrences of the digit '1' across both players' hands. My hand contains no '1's, so the only way to challenge this bid is if I believe Player 1 is bluffing or overestimating the count of '1's. Given that I have no '1's in my hand, I suspect that Player 1's bid is likely invalid. I will challenge the bid instead of making a higher one, as I cannot successfully bid higher than '2 1s' without having '1's.
