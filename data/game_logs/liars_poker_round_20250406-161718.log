Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (26391571), I have one 1, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 9. Since this is the opening bid and I have one 1, starting with a conservative bid of '2 1s' seems reasonable. This leaves room for escalation while being likely true since I already have one 1 and only need one more across the opponent's 8 digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 1s, making it less likely that the total number of 1s across both hands is high. The current bid is 2 1s, which is plausible, but I have no evidence to confidently challenge yet. To maintain pressure and avoid an early challenge, I will make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit at the same quantity, moving from 2 1s to 2 2s, since I have two 2s in my hand, making this bid quite safe.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand (26391571). The opponent bid '2 2s', suggesting they believe there are at least 2 twos total. Since I only have one 2, and they bid exactly 2, this could be a bluff. However, it's a very conservative bid and they likely have at least one 2 as well. Rather than challenge such a low bid, I should increase it. Looking at my hand, I have one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 9. I could bid '2 5s' or higher. Bidding '2 9s' is safer since I already have one 9, and it's a higher digit than 2 with the same quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 9S'
Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 2 9s, so for the bid to be true, the opponent would need at least one 9, which is plausible. Since I have one 9, a safe and reasonable higher bid would be 3 9s, assuming roughly average distribution. This increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same, satisfying the bidding rules.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The opponent bid 3 9s, meaning they're claiming there are at least 2 more 9s in their hand. While possible, this seems unlikely given they raised from my 2 9s bid. With only 8 digits in their hand and them needing at least 2 9s to make their bid valid (since I only have 1), I think they're bluffing.
