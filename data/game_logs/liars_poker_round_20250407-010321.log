Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid in the game. Looking at my hand (73180812), I have: one 0, two 1s, two 8s, one 3, one 7, and one 2. Since I have two 1s and two 8s, these are my strongest digits. I could bid on either, but I'll choose 8s since they're a higher digit. Since this is the first bid, I can start conservatively. I know there are at least two 8s (in my hand), and there could be more in my opponent's hand. A reasonable opening bid would be '3 8s', suggesting there's at least one more 8 in my opponent's hand beyond my two.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand (42663607). For the bid to be true, the opponent must have all three 8s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, challenging seems reasonable. However, I have a very strong hand in 6s, holding three of them myself. Bidding 4 6s only requires the opponent to have one 6 out of their eight digits, which is statistically likely (expected value is 0.8). This is a safer and more assertive move based on my hand strength compared to challenging the opponent's bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have 8 digits in my hand (73180812), which contains two 8s, one 7, one 3, one 1, and three 0s. The current bid is '4 6s' made by my opponent. Looking at my hand, I don't have any 6s. Since there are 16 total digits in play (8 in my hand, 8 in my opponent's hand), and I have zero 6s, my opponent would need to have at least 4 6s in their hand for the bid to be valid. While this is possible, it seems somewhat unlikely that they would have that many of a single digit. I could challenge, but there's still a reasonable chance they have 4 6s. Alternatively, I could make a higher bid. I have three 0s in my hand, so bidding '5 0s' would be a reasonable move, as I only need my opponent to have two 0s for this to be valid. I'll go with this safer option.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I only have one 0 in my hand (42663607). For the bid to be true, the opponent must have at least four 0s in their 8-digit hand. The statistical probability of having four or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is very low (under 1%). Given this low probability, the opponent's bid is highly likely to be an overbid or a bluff. Therefore, challenging is the most strategically sound move.
