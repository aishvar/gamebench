Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid, I can start with a low bid based on my hand. I have two 1s, so bidding 3 1s is a safe starting point.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand and no 1s. The current bid is 3 1s, which I believe is unlikely since I cannot contribute to that count. I can bid 4 6s, which is a valid higher bid based on my hand.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I don't have any 6s in my hand. However, I also don't have enough information to confidently challenge. I can increase the bid to 5 0s, which is a safe move since 0 is the lowest digit and I'm increasing the quantity. This forces the other player to make a more informed decision.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand and the current bid is 5 0s. Since I have a substantial count of 6s, I can bid 6 6s, which is a valid higher bid both in quantity and digit. This also aligns with my hand, making it a reasonable move.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. There are 16 total digits. It's possible there are six 6s, but it's also possible there aren't. I will increase the bid to 7 6s. This is a safer move than challenging, as it forces the opponent to make a potentially riskier bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 7 6s. Since I have enough 6s to support a bid of 8 6s, I will increase the quantity to make a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 6S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 8 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. The maximum possible number of 6s is 16. 8 6s is a relatively high bid. I will bid higher by increasing the quantity to 9.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 6S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 9 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, which means there are likely more than 9 6s in total when considering both players' hands. I can increase the quantity to 10 while maintaining the digit, which is a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 6S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 10 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. The maximum possible count of any digit is 16. It's getting risky to keep bidding higher on 6s. I'll challenge.
