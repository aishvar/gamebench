Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 3s, one 4, one 5, one 7, and one 8. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 3s, as I already have two 3s in my hand, and it's likely there are additional 3s in my opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have one 3 in my hand (23428795). For the bid to be true, Player 0 needs at least one 3 in their 8 digits, which is statistically likely. Challenging this low bid seems risky. I need to make a higher bid. Options are increasing the quantity (e.g., 3 0s) or keeping the quantity at 2 and increasing the digit (e.g., 2 4s). My hand contains two 2s. Bidding '3 2s' is a valid higher bid (quantity increases from 2 to 3). This bid leverages my hand's strength (two 2s) and requires Player 0 to have at least one 2 among their 8 digits, which is a reasonable assumption. This seems like a better strategic move than bidding low on a digit I only hold one of (like '2 4s' or '2 5s') or challenging.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand, which makes it plausible that there are at least three 2s across both hands. However, bidding higher is safer than challenging at this stage, as the current bid is not overly ambitious. I also have two 3s in my hand, which makes bidding 4 3s a reasonable and strategic move to increase the quantity while choosing a digit I have more of.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I hold one 3 (in hand 23428795), meaning the opponent needs at least three 3s in their 8-digit hand for the bid to be true. The opponent (Player 0) started the bidding with 2 3s and then raised to 4 3s immediately after my bid of 3 2s. This escalation suggests confidence in the digit 3, making a challenge seem risky. My hand contains two 2s, which is my most frequent digit. Bidding 5 2s is a reasonable escalation. It requires three 2s from the opponent's 8 unknown digits, which is statistically plausible. This bid leverages the known strength in my hand and increases the quantity, putting pressure back on the opponent.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 2S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) bids: 5 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s, and I have no 2s in my hand. For the bid to be valid, there must be at least 5 total 2s between both players' hands. Given that I have 8 digits and none are 2s, Player 1 would need to have all 5 of the required 2s in their hand, which is unlikely. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
