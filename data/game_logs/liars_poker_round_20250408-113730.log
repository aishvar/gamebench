Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a good mix of digits in my hand. To make a valid bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 9, I can increase the digit to 9s. The current bid is still None, so I can start with a low quantity and a high digit. I'll bid 2 9s to start.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The opponent bid '2 9s', which means they believe there are at least 2 nines total between our hands. Since I can see one 9 in my hand, this is a reasonable bid. Given my hand also has two 3s and one 7, I could safely bid '2 3s' or '3 3s', but that's not higher than '2 9s'. A reasonable move would be to bid '3 9s' since there could be more 9s in the opponent's hand, and it's a relatively conservative increase in quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s, but I have two 9s in my hand. I should bid higher to increase both quantity and digit, but I don't have a digit higher than 9. I'll increase the quantity to 4, making a reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand (22371379). The opponent has bid 4 9s total, meaning they're claiming there are at least 3 more 9s in their hand. While possible, this seems unlikely given the escalating pattern of bids and that they didn't start with such a high bid. Since I can see only one 9 and they would need 3 more to make their bid valid, I should challenge.
