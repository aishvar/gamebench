Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I can make the first bid. Looking at my hand (30196370), I see that I have two 0s, one 1, one 3, one 6, one 7, and two 9s. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the most frequent digit in my hand. I have two 0s and two 9s, so either 0 or 9 is a good candidate. Bidding '2 9s' seems like a reasonable starting point as it reflects my hand's composition and starts with a relatively high digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Considering the total of 16 digits, challenging the bid is a strategic move. If the total 9s are less than 2, I win. If not, I lose, but the risk is manageable given the uncertainty.
