Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 4s, two 9s, and one 2 and one 6. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be 2 4s or 2 9s. I will choose 2 4s as my opening bid, reflecting the number I have and starting conservatively.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have one 4 and two other digits higher than 4 in my hand (5, 6, 6, 7). The quantity is low, and I can increase it. I can also change the digit to a higher one. I will bid 3 5s, increasing both the digit and the quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 20449906, I have two 4s, zero 5s, and no obvious reason to believe there are three or more 5s total. Since I have no 5s, the opponent would need all three (or more) 5s in their hand, which is unlikely given the distribution of digits. The probability that the opponent has at least three 5s is low, so challenging the current bid of 3 5s is statistically favorable.
