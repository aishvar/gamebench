Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, so it's plausible that there's at least one 0 across both hands. However, I should consider making a higher bid to potentially put pressure on Player 0 or to reflect a digit I have more of. I have two 8s and 9s are not present in my hand but I do have other digits. Bidding 1 1s is a minimal increase in digit, which is a valid move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 2s. I can see that my hand contains one 2. Given that there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand, it's plausible that there's at least one more 2 in the opponent's hand, making a total of at least 2 2s. I can make a higher bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 1 3s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit and keeps the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid according to the rules.
