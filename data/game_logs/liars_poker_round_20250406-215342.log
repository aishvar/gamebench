Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make a valid initial bid. I have two 6s, one 3, one 1, one 0, one 7, and one 8 in my hand. I will start with a bid of 2 6s, which is reasonable given that I have two of that digit.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 8s. Given that I have at least one 8, I can reasonably increase the bid to 4 8s, which is a valid higher bid. This takes into account my own hand while still being a higher quantity than the previous bid.
