Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid, I need to make the first bid. My hand is 90362689. I count 2 sixes and 1 nine, and other digits appear once or not at all. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and leave room for escalation. Bidding 3 6s seems like a good starting point as it reflects a slight increase from what I see in my hand and is a relatively conservative bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. It's plausible that there are at least three 6s in total. I could bid 4 6s, but it's safer to bid a slightly higher digit with the same quantity. I will bid 3 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (90362689), and I know there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have information about my own hand, I can count my digits. I have: 0(1), 1(0), 2(1), 3(1), 6(2), 7(1), 8(1), 9(1). I have one 7, so there are at least 2 7s in total. Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, bidding 3 8s is also valid as it keeps the same quantity but bids on a higher digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I don't have any 8s in my hand. However, there are 16 total digits in play. Bidding 4 0s is a safe increase in quantity, and 0 is a relatively common digit. It's less risky than challenging immediately.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have a lot of confidence in the count of higher digits being very high across both hands, I'll start by increasing the quantity. The next possible bid is 5 0s. I'll analyze my hand to see if I can make a more informed decision. My hand is 90362689, and I see one 0. It's possible the other player has more 0s, but bidding 5 0s is a bit aggressive. I'll consider the likelihood and the risk. For now, I'll make a more conservative bid by keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit, so I'll bid 4 1s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. It is possible that there are at least four 1s in total. I could bid higher, but it is risky. A safer option is to challenge, as the other player might be bluffing.
