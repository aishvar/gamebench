Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, the counts of digits are: 5 (2), 6 (2), 8 (1), 9 (1), 4 (2). The most common digits in my hand are 5, 6, and 4, each appearing twice. A safe opening bid would be 2 of one of these digits, as I can reasonably expect at least one more occurrence in the opponent's hand, making 2 a conservative but credible starting bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and the opponent has bid 2 5s, it is likely that they have at least one 5. However, challenging at this point might be risky because the opponent could have more 5s. To play it safe, I will make a bid that is higher than the current bid but not too aggressive. I will bid 1 Q, as it is a higher digit and there is a chance the opponent does not have any Qs.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have no 5s in my hand, but I have two 0s. Since the maximum possible quantity is 16, and the opponent has bid 2 5s, it's reasonable to challenge if I believe the opponent does not have two 5s. However, challenging is risky if the opponent does have two 5s. Bidding 2 0s is a safe move that increases the bid and is likely to be valid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. It's unlikely that the opposing player has 2 5s, so I will challenge the bid.
