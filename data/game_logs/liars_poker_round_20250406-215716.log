Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand, which gives me a strong position. The current bid is 3 0s, and I can confidently bid 4 8s, which is a valid higher bid both in quantity and digit. This increases the challenge for my opponent while leveraging my strong hand.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. The maximum number of 8s possible is 16. Since the bid is relatively low, it's not unreasonable. I will bid slightly higher to continue the game. I will bid 5 0s, using my two 0s as a starting point and hoping my opponent doesn't have too many.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and the current bid is only 5 0s. I can increase the bid by either raising the quantity or the digit. Since I have strong digits (8s), I can bid 6 8s, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 6 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. It's possible, but 6 is a high quantity. I have no 8s in my hand. I could bid higher, but I think the probability of there being at least six 8s is relatively low. Challenging seems like the better option.
