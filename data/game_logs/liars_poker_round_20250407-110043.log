--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 8s, one 6, one 2, one 0, and one 2. Starting with a moderate and statistically reasonable bid, I will open with '3 3s', leveraging my two 3s and the chance that the opponent has at least one 3.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 3s in my hand (0,2,5,1,1,9,9,6). The current bid is 3 3s, which would require the opponent to hold all three. Given there are 16 total digits (8 per player), the probability of a player holding exactly three 3s is low (~3.3% based on binomial distribution). Since I have none, challenging forces a reveal where the opponent likely has fewer than three 3s, making their bid invalid.
