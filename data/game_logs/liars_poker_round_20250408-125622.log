Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 7.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have zero 7s in my hand, meaning all three 7s would have to be in Player 0's hand alone. While it's possible Player 0 has three 7s, it's risky to assume they're bluffing at such a low number. However, my hand includes two 8s, making it safer to increase the bid to 3 8s, as I already have two of them, requiring only one more between both hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 4 7s is a valid higher bid because it increases the quantity while keeping the same digit. This seems like a reasonable risk given my hand and the bid history.

Player 0 bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 05388464, which contains digits 0, 5, 3, 8, 8, 4, 6, and 4. I have zero 7s. The opponent first bid 3 7s, then raised to 4 7s after I bid 3 8s. Given that I hold no 7s, the opponent would need to have all four 7s in their hand for their bid to be accurate. This scenario is possible but somewhat unlikely, considering they increased their bid after my 3 8s bid. It's more likely they're bluffing or overestimating. Therefore, challenging the bid of 4 7s seems like the most reasonable action.
