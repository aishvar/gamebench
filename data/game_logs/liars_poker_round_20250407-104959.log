Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 8s, two 3s, one 1, one 2, and one 7. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s or 2 8s, as I hold two of each. I'll start with 2 8s, as 8 is a relatively high digit, making it slightly more aggressive and potentially discouraging low-digit bids from the opponent.
