--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to set a bid that is plausible but difficult to challenge. My hand has two 9s. Bidding 3 9s assumes the opponent has at least one 9, which is reasonable given the randomness of hands. This bid is aggressive enough to pressure the opponent but not obviously impossible since the total could reach 4 if they have two 9s. Starting with a higher quantity on my strongest digit minimizes my risk and creates uncertainty.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 nines. Looking at my hand (4,8,2,7,5,2,6,1), I have zero 9s. For Player 0's bid to be valid, there must be at least 3 nines between both hands. Since I have none, Player 0 must have all 3 or more 9s, which is statistically unlikely given only 8 digits. It's improbable for one player to hold 3 or more of the same digit, especially 9s, without me holding any. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move.
