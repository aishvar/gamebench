Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 3s, two 2s, one 1, one 4, and one 7. The most common digits in my hand are 2 and 2 (two occurrences each), but overall, the digit 2 appears twice, which is strong. Opening with a conservative yet reasonable bid based on my hand, I will start with 3 2s, assuming the opponent likely has at least one 2 as well.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. Bidding 4 2s would be risky as it relies entirely on my opponent having a significant number of 2s. I have two 9s, so bidding 4 9s is a reasonable option, increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have, like 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 9. Considering the current bid and my hand, bidding 4 9s seems like a good balance between increasing the quantity and leveraging my own cards. It's a plausible bid without being overly aggressive.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s, which reduces the likelihood of there being at least 4 nines across both hands. Since I hold 8 digits and none are 9s, all 4 or more 9s would have to be in Player 1's hand, which is very unlikely. Therefore, challenging the current bid is the best move.
