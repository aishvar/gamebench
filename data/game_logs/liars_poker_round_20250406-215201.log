Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a diverse hand with digits 2, 6, 8, 0, 4, 3, 7, and 9. Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a reasonable bid. I will bid 2 2s, as I have one 2 in my hand and it is a low quantity to begin with, allowing for potential growth in future rounds.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 2s. The current bid is 2 2s, which means there must be at least two 2s across both hands. Since I have no 2s, all 2s must be in Player 0's hand, which is possible but not guaranteed. However, instead of challenging, I can safely make a higher bid based on my hand. I have two 3s, so I know there are at least two 3s in play, and increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same is a valid strategy.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 2 and one 3 in my hand, making it possible to have at least 2 3s total. The current bid is 2 3s, and I can raise the bid by increasing the quantity to 3 3s, which is a reasonable move given I have one 3.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 3s. This means there need to be at least two more 3s in Player 0's hand to meet the bid. While possible, it's not guaranteed, and I want to avoid challenging prematurely. Instead, I can safely raise the bid by increasing the digit to 4, as I have two 0s in my hand, suggesting there could reasonably be more 0s overall.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 4s. Since I can confirm at least one 4 exists in my hand, I can safely increase the bid. I will bid 4 4s, which increases the quantity while keeping the same digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. In my hand, I have two 4s. This means that for the bid to be valid, there must be at least two more 4s in Player 0's hand. While this is possible, I find it more strategic to increase the bid slightly to maintain pressure and avoid challenging prematurely. I will bid 4 5s, raising the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s, two 8s, and one 7 in my hand, but no 5s. The current bid is 4 5s, which is unlikely given I have no 5s. Since there are only 16 digits total, I believe the count of 5s is less than 4. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
