Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s and two 0s, which are the most frequent digits. Opening with a modest but solid bid based on my hand makes sense. I will start with 2 3s, reflecting my own cards, which is a reasonable opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 3 and one 4. The current bid is 2 4s, which means at least two 4s across both hands. Since I have one 4, it's plausible my opponent has at least one more, making the current bid reasonable. To increase, I can either bid 2 5s or 3 of any digit. I don't have many 5s (only one), but I do have two 3s in my hand, making a bid of 3 3s a safer and reasonable next bid, as it only requires one more 3 from the opponent's hand, which is likely.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 4. The current bid is 3 4s, so for that to be true, the opponent would need to have at least two 4s. Given the distribution of digits, that is plausible but not guaranteed. Since it's early in the bidding and the bid is moderate, I can safely increase the bid by raising the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have two 3s, so bidding 3 5s is a reasonable and safe incremental bid that is strictly higher.
