Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. I will analyze my hand to determine a reasonable starting bid. My hand is 94873215. The count of each digit in my hand is: 9(1), 4(1), 8(1), 7(1), 3(1), 2(1), 1(1), 5(1). I see that I have one '2', so I can bid on '2'. A reasonable starting bid could be the count of a digit I have. I will bid on the digit '2' with a count of 1, as it's a conservative start.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so it's my turn to start the bidding. I will analyze my hand: 94873215. The count of each digit in my hand is: 9(1), 4(1), 8(1), 7(1), 3(1), 2(1), 1(1), 5(1). I have a total of 8 digits. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the most frequent digit in my hand. Since all digits appear once, I can choose any digit. I'll bid on '1' as it's a relatively low digit and I have one '1'. The quantity is 1. So, a valid bid is '1 D'. However, the task requires the bid to be in the format 'BID: Q D', where 'Q' is the quantity and 'D' is the digit. Thus, my bid will be 'BID: 1 1'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 one. Looking at my hand (87302066), I have zero 1s. Since I have no 1s, the opponent must be counting on at least one 1 in their own hand to justify this bid. Given that each player holds 8 digits, there are 16 digits total. Statistically, it's very likely that there is at least one 1 across both hands, so challenging now would be risky. Instead, I should make a safe higher bid. In my hand, I have two 0s and three 6s. Bidding 2 zeros is a safe and natural increase because I hold two zeros myself, making it plausible that there are at least two zeros in total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have the digits 94873215, which contains no 0s. Since there are 2 players and each has 8 digits, the total count of 0s can't exceed 8 (if the other player had all 0s). The bid of 2 0s is relatively low considering the maximum possible count is 16 and the other player can have at most 8. However, I can see that I have no 0s, so the count is at least 2 if the other player has 2 or more 0s. To exceed the current bid, I need to bid on a higher digit or a higher count. My hand has 1 '1', so I know the count of '1's is at least 1. The previous bid was 1 1s, so I can bid higher than that. I will bid on a higher count of '1's.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 ones. Looking at my hand (87302066), I have zero '1's, which means the entire bid depends on the opponent having at least two '1's. Given that each player has 8 digits, the average count of any specific digit is around 1.6, but since I have none, it's less likely the opponent has two or more. Therefore, the bid of 2 '1's is somewhat risky for Player 0, making a challenge favorable. Additionally, I have three '0's in my hand, and since I previously bid 2 '0's, a higher zero bid (like 3 0s) is plausible. This would be a safer incremental bid compared to raising the '1's count. Thus, the best move is to bid 3 zeros.

Player 1 bids: 3 0s

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have the digits 94873215, which contains 0 zeros. Since there are 2 players and each has 8 digits, the total number of digits is 16. The probability of having more than 3 zeros is low because the expected number of zeros is 1.6 (16 * 0.1). However, the bid of 3 0s is not extremely high. I need to consider my own hand and the fact that the opponent has already made a bid on zeros, indicating they might have some. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or change the digit. Increasing the quantity to 4 0s seems too high given my hand and the likelihood. I can bid on a different digit that is more common in my hand. I have 1 '1', 1 '2', 1 '3', 1 '5', 1 '7', 1 '8', and 2 '9's. The digit '9' is the most frequent in my hand. The current bid is on '0's, so I can bid on '9's or increase the count of another digit. Since there's already a bid on '1's (2 1s was my last bid), I can consider bidding on '9's or another digit that hasn't been bid on recently. Bidding 2 '9's would be a valid move as it exceeds the current bid by changing the digit and is a reasonable count given my hand and the possibility that the other player might also have '9's.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have the digits 94873215, which contains 0 zeros. The total number of zeros across both players is at most 8 (since the other player has 8 digits). The probability of having exactly 3 zeros is relatively low, and it's even more unlikely that the total count is exactly 3 given that I have no zeros. However, the bid is not extremely high (3 out of 16 possible). I need to either challenge or make a higher bid. My hand has a relatively high count of '1's (2 ones). The current bid is on '0's, so I can bid on a different digit. I will bid on '1's with a higher count than my previous bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 ones. Looking at my hand (8 7 3 0 2 0 6 6), I have zero '1's. So, for the bid to be valid, Player 0 must have all 3 or more '1's in their hand. The probability that Player 0 has 3 or more '1's out of 8 digits is quite low, especially since I have none. Given this, the bid is likely an overstatement. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move rather than raising the bid.
