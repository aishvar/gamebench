Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 8s, and one 0, 1, 2, and 6 each. A safe opening bid would be 2 5s or 2 8s, reflecting the digits I have multiple of. To start conservatively but credibly, I will bid 2 8s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s and zero 9s. The current bid is 2 9s, which requires at least two 9s across both hands. Since I have none, all two must be in the opponent's hand, which is unlikely but possible. Instead of challenging now, I can safely increase the bid by raising the quantity to 3 and choosing 8s, since I already hold two 8s myself, making three 8s across both hands quite plausible.
