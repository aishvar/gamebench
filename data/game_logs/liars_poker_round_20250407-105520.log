Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Since it's very early in the game with only the opening bid, the optimal strategy is to raise conservatively. I have two 5s and two 4s, so increasing the bid to 2 5s leverages my strong count of 5s and is a natural, safe escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6. The current bid is 2 6s, which is plausible given my single 6 and the opponent's 8 digits. Given the naive opponent's 50/50 strategy, it's likely they have at least one 6 as well, so challenging now would be risky. To increase the bid, I can either bid 2 7s or 3 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have three 5s and 0s combined, but I already bid 2 5s earlier. I also have two 0s and two 4s, but only one 6. The most promising is to bid 3 5s since I have two 5s myself, so the total likely exceeds or equals three. This is a safe incremental bid.
