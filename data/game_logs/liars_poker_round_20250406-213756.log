Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I need to make the first bid. I have two 3s, one 2, one 4, one 6, one 7 and one 9 in my hand. A conservative bid would be 1 of any digit. I'll bid 1 9s, as I have one in my hand, and it's a reasonable starting point.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 1 9s. Bidding 2 9s is a valid higher bid based on my hand.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 3 9s would be a reasonable increase, but it's risky since I only have one 9. Instead, I'll bid 3 2s. I have two 2s in my hand, and increasing the digit while only slightly increasing the quantity is a good strategy. It's less likely my opponent has a high count of 2s than 9s.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have two 9s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid 3 9s. This bid is higher in terms of digit value while maintaining the same quantity, making it a strategic move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand. Given the bid history, Player 1 seems confident in 9s. However, with only two players and 16 total digits, 3 9s is still plausible but not overwhelmingly likely. I have two 3s. Bidding 4 3s is a reasonable move, increasing the quantity and changing the digit. It's a slightly risky bid, but better than immediately challenging a potentially valid bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. With only one 3 in my hand, it's unlikely that there are four 3s in total. Challenging this bid could reveal the actual count and potentially win the round.
