Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to start the bidding with a reasonable bid. My hand contains 5, 2, 8, 7, 1, and 6. I notice I have two 7s and one 8, but no other digits are present in my hand. Given the absence of other digits, I'll focus on bidding on a digit that's present in my hand. I'll choose the digit 7, as it's present twice, and make a bid of 2 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. Since I don't have any 7s, I will increase the bid to 3 0s, which is a safe increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have a 0 in my hand. I can make a bid with a higher quantity or the same quantity but a higher digit. Since I have no other digits besides 0, I should increase the quantity. Bidding 4 0s seems reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I don't have any 0s in my hand. It's possible there are four 0s out there, but I can bid higher without risking too much. I can bid 5 1s, as I have one 1 in my hand. This raises the quantity and the digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. Given my hand includes a 1, I should bid a higher quantity of 1s or the same quantity with a higher digit. I have one 1 in my hand, so bidding 6 1s is a reasonable increase in both quantity and digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Bidding higher is risky, as the total number of 1s across both hands would need to be at least 7. However, since I have a 1, I can bid 7 1s. Alternatively, I could bid 6 of a higher number, but I don't have many of any other single number. I will bid 7 1s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s. I have 1 in my hand. I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have no other digits in my hand, I will increase the quantity to 8 and keep the digit 1, as it is the highest digit in the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. It's possible there are at least 8 ones in total, but it's also possible the previous player is bluffing. I could bid higher, but I'm not confident enough to go much higher. Since the bid is already at 8, and the maximum possible is 16, I will bid 9 1s. This increases the pressure on the other player without being too risky.
