Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. Since I'm the first to bid, I'll start with a moderate quantity on a common digit. Bidding 3 5s seems reasonable, as there's a chance the other player might have at least one more 5.
