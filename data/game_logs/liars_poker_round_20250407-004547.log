Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: With the current bid being 'None', I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 6s and two 9s, which are the highest frequency digits in my hand. Bidding 2 9s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit and I have a pair of them, setting a baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, so the current bid of 2 9s must come entirely from Player 0's hand. Challenging is a reasonable move since the bid is low and the likelihood of Player 0 having exactly two 9s is uncertain.
