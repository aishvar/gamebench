Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 0s, two 2s (counted already), one 5, one 7, one 3, two 2s (counted already), two 8s. The most frequent digit is 2, appearing three times, and 2 zeros and 2 eights. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will bid 3 2s, expecting that the opponent likely has at least one or more 2s as well.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. I have two 6s and two 9s. Bidding 4 2s would be a slight increase in quantity, but I have no 2s, so it's risky. Bidding 3 3s is also possible, but I don't have any 3s. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable option, as I have two 6s, and it increases both the quantity and the digit. Bidding 3 9s is also reasonable, as I have two 9s. Given I have more 6s than 9s, I will bid 4 6s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '25072328', I have zero 6s. Since there are 8 digits in the opponent's hand, for the bid of 4 6s to be valid, the opponent would need at least 4 or more 6s total, which is quite unlikely given I have none. The probability of 4 or more 6s in 8 random digits is low. Therefore, challenging is the strategic move here.
