Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. Since I have two 8s in my hand, I can make a higher bid with a higher quantity and digit. Bidding 3 9s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have a 9 in my hand. The current bid is 4 0s, which is a very low digit. Considering my hand and the low digit of the current bid, I should increase the digit to a higher one, but since the quantity is already high, I should not increase it. I will bid 4 9s, increasing the digit to 9.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have two 8s and one 9 in my hand. Given the bid history and my hand, I should make a bid that increases the quantity or digit. Since 5 0s is a low bid, I can safely increase the digit to 9s or 0s. However, I have no 0s in my hand, so I'll increase the digit to 9s.
