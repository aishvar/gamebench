Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid, I need to establish a baseline. I have three 3s in my hand. It's reasonable to start with a bid of 3 threes, as it's likely the opponent doesn't have enough to push it much higher immediately. A low initial bid allows me to gather information about the opponent's hand without risking a quick challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid. I have three 3s, two 7s, and one 9. A safe starting bid is to bid 2 of the digit 7. This is a reasonable quantity given my hand and doesn't reveal too much information.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s, meaning Player 0 is claiming there are at least two '7's across both hands. Looking at my hand (54845901), I have no '7's. This means Player 0 is relying solely on their hand to justify the bid. Since there are only 8 digits per hand and I have no '7's, it is unlikely for Player 0 to have two or more '7's in their hand. Therefore, I believe the bid is too high and will challenge it.
