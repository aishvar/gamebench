Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. Since it's the first bid, I can choose any quantity and digit. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable opening bid, as it's likely the other player has at least one more 5 given the total of 16 digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s, and I only hold one 5 in my hand. For the bid to be correct, the opponent must have at least 2 more 5s among their 8 digitsâ€”a scenario that's statistically unlikely. Given this probability, it's a strong moment to challenge.
