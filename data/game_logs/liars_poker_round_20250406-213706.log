--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player, I want to start with a conservative but reasonable opening bid. My hand contains two 6s, two 0s, and one each of 1, 4, 7, and 9. Statistically, each digit appears roughly 1.6 times per player, so an opening bid of 3 of a digit I have multiple of is safe. Since I have two 6s, bidding 3 6s is a solid start.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have three 0s in my hand, which is a higher digit than 6. Bidding 3 0s is a valid higher bid and leverages the digits I hold.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have no 6s in my hand, so the other player must have all three. Challenging seems risky, but given the uncertainty, it might be worth testing the bid.
