--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a good mix of digits in my hand, but none of them are particularly high. Since the current bid is None, I should start with a conservative bid that increases the quantity of a common digit. I'll choose 5s as they are relatively common and have a high chance of being in the other players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s, which would require Player 0 to have at least three 5s. Given that I have none, it's possible that Player 0 is bluffing or has a high number of 5s. Challenging this bid is a calculated risk to test the validity of the claim.
