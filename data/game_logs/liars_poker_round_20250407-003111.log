Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s, one 3, one 4, one 9, one 1, and one 6 in my hand. Since there are no previous bids, I can start by bidding 2 2s, which is a reasonable opening bid given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 2 2s, which means there must be at least two 2s in total. Since I only have one 2, the only way to meet or exceed the current bid is if my opponent also has at least one 2. To make a valid higher bid, I can increase the quantity to 3 2s, assuming my opponent has at least one 2. This is a reasonable assumption given the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 2s. Since I know there are at least 2 2s in play (my own), I can safely bid 4 2s to increase the quantity while maintaining the same digit.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand, and the current bid is 4 2s. Since there are only 16 digits in total and I only have one 2, it's unlikely there are 4 2s in total. However, to keep the game moving and avoid an immediate challenge, I can bid higher by increasing the quantity to 5 2s, which is still plausible given the total number of digits.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 2S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 5 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 2s. Since I know there are at least 2 2s from my hand, I can safely assume there might be more 2s from my opponent's hand. However, to make a valid higher bid, I can bid 6 2s, which is a reasonable increase in quantity, as it is still possible given the total of 16 digits in play.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 2S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 6 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand, and the current bid is 6 2s. Since there are only 16 digits in total and the bid history shows a rapid increase in quantity for the digit 2, it's unlikely that there are actually 6 or more 2s in play. Challenging seems like the best move.
