Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have digits: 8, 6, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 2. The digit '1' appears twice, which is relatively common and likely to appear in the opponent's hand as well. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 ones ('1's), reflecting my two and expecting at least one more in the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand of 37983750, I have zero 1s. The opponent bid '2 1s', claiming there are at least 2 ones total between both hands. Since I have none, that means they would need to have at least 2 ones in their hand for their bid to be true. While possible, I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Given that I have two 3s in my hand, I know for certain there are at least 2 threes in total, making '2 3s' a safe bid that advances the game.

Player 1 bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. Looking at my hand (86112442), I have zero 3s. Since I don't hold any 3s, the entire count of 3s depends solely on my opponent's hand. For the bid of 2 3s to be valid, the opponent must have at least two 3s. Given that each player has 8 digits, the probability that the opponent has two or more 3s is relatively low (roughly 25% or less). This makes the current bid quite risky to accept. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move here.
