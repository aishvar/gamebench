Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains the digits 5, 0, 5, 7, 6, 8, 4, 3. I see that I have two 5s and two other digits that appear once. To start, I should make a conservative bid that is likely to be valid but also not too easy to beat. I have two 5s, so bidding 2 5s seems like a reasonable starting point.
