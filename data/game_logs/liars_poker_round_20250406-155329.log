Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 8, and two 9s. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid based on my strongest digit, I will bid 2 9s, reflecting the two 9s I possess.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 3 9s would be a reasonable increase, as it only increases the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit I have more of, like 2 8s or 2 5s. However, given the relatively low current bid, increasing the quantity of the 9s seems like the most logical next step. Bidding 3 0s would also be valid, but I don't want to reveal that I have 2 0s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. Since the current bid is 3 9s, for that to be true there must be at least two 9s in Player 1's hand, which is possible but somewhat unlikely. However, since the bid is only 3 and there are 16 digits total, it's still plausible. Rather than challenge now, a safer strategy is to increase the bid modestly. I don't have many 9s, so instead I will increase the quantity to 4, but switch to a digit I have more of. I have two 4s, so bidding 4 4s increases the quantity and switches to a digit where I have significant presence, making it a reasonable next bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 4s is necessary. I have two 5s, so bidding 5 5s is a reasonable option, increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 8 (two 8s). However, going with 5 5s seems like a safer bet as it's a direct increase from the previous digit and quantity isn't extremely high.

Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 5 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 4, 6, 4, 5, 0, 9, 3, 8. This includes one 5. For the current bid of 5 5s to be valid, there would need to be at least four more 5s in Player 1's hand, which is unlikely given only eight digits. Since five of the same digit across both hands is already on the higher side of probability and I only have one 5, I believe the bid is an overstatement. Therefore, it's strategically sound to challenge.
