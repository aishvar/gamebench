Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 3, two 7s, one 8, one 4, and one 9. A safe opening bid is typically 2 of a digit I have at least one or two of. I have two 7s, so bidding 2 7s is a reasonable and safe opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. In my hand, I have no 7s, which makes it less likely that there are at least two 7s across both hands. Given that there are only 16 total digits in play and I have none of the bid digit, I find it unlikely that Player 0 has at least two 7s in their hand. Therefore, I should challenge the bid rather than risk making an unsupported higher bid.
