Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without worrying about being too high. I see I have two 6s and two 5s in my hand. A bid of '2 5s' or '2 6s' seems reasonable as a starting point. I will choose to bid '2 6s' as it seems more likely to be lower than other digits' counts, given the distribution of digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I could bid higher, but I don't want to overcommit. A safe bid would be 3 6s, as it only increases the quantity by 1. Alternatively, I could bid 2 7s, which increases the digit. I'll choose the latter.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 6s, and I can see that bidding a higher quantity or digit could be advantageous. Since I have two 6s, I can confidently bid on this digit. The current bid is 2 7s, so I need to bid higher than this. I can bid 3 6s or higher quantity with a different digit, or a higher digit with the same or lower quantity.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. It's possible there are at least three 6s in total. However, I also have two 8s and two 9s. I will bid higher using the 8s, increasing the quantity to 4. This seems like a safer option than challenging, as there might be three 6s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that this bid can be beaten. My hand contains 2 sixes, which could potentially be used to make a higher bid if I choose to. However, I also need to consider the possibility of challenging if I think the bid is unlikely to be true. Given my hand (76056541), I have 2 sixes and 1 eight. The bid of 4 8s seems high but I do not have enough information about Player 1's hand to accurately assess the likelihood of there being 4 or more 8s in total. I should consider making a bid that seems reasonable based on my hand and the bid history.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 6 6s is a safe increment.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, and the bid history shows increasing quantities but not necessarily a trend of higher digits. Given that I have two 6s and the bid is already at 6 6s, I should consider if I can reasonably increase the bid or challenge. Since my hand contains two 6s and I know there are at least 6 sixes bid so far (from 6 6s), I should assess if bidding higher is plausible or if challenging is more strategic. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and with 8 digits per player, there could be up to 16 6s in total. However, given that the current bid is 6 6s and I have only two 6s, I should consider if there's a higher digit I could bid on or increase the quantity slightly if I think there are more 6s or other digits that could fit. Given my hand does not have significantly higher counts of other digits, I will increase the quantity slightly and bid on a digit that could reasonably exist more than the current bid digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To bid, I need to increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 8 0s is a safe increment, as it only increases the quantity and uses the lowest digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 8 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 0s. I need to assess the likelihood of there being 8 or more 0s in total. Given that I have no 0s in my hand (76056541), and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I must consider if it's plausible that Player 1 has 8 or more 0s. Since I have no 0s, I can only rely on the possibility of Player 1 having them. I should challenge if it seems unlikely.
