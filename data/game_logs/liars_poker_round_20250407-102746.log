Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there has been no bid yet, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 8s, and one 9, which suggests these digits are relatively strong candidates. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 3 7s, as I already hold two and it's likely there is at least one more 7 in the opponent's hand.
