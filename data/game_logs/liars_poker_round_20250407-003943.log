Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains two 2s, and I can start with a conservative bid to gauge the game. I will bid 2 2s as there are at least two 2s in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid is 2 2s. Bidding 3 3s is a safe and reasonable move, increasing both the quantity and the digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 6s, and I see potential to increase the quantity or digit. Since the bid is currently at 3 3s, I should aim for a higher quantity or a higher digit. I have two 6s, so bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 6s. Since I only have two 6s, it's unlikely there are four 6s in total. However, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity to 5, but I don't have enough 6s to support this. Instead, I can bid on a different digit. I have three 9s, so bidding 5 9s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 9S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 5 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that this bid can be beaten. My hand contains a 2, 2, 5, 6, 8, and a 9. I have no 9s, but I do have multiple higher digits. The bid of 5 9s seems high but I have to consider if it can be valid. If I bid 6 0s, it would be higher in quantity than the current bid but I need to ensure it's plausible given my hand and potential hands of the opponent.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, and the current bid is 6 0s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and I have none, it's highly unlikely there are 6 or more 0s in play. Challenging seems like the best move.
