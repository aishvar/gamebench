Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. I should start by bidding on a digit that is likely to be high in the other player's hand, but not too high that it's unlikely. Bidding on the digit 4 seems reasonable, given the current bid is None.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I already hold two 5s in my hand, so there are definitely at least two 5s total. Raising the bid to 2 5s is safe and strictly higher than 1 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s, which seems relatively low considering the possible range of digits. I have a 5 in my hand, but not enough to confidently bid a higher quantity. However, I can bid a higher digit, as I have a 6 in my hand. Bidding 1 6s seems like a reasonable increase, given the current bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s, which seems reasonable given the low quantity. However, I have a 5 in my hand, so I should bid higher. Bidding 3 5s is a safe bet, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I already see two 5s in my own hand, so three 5s overall is quite plausible and challenging would be risky. Itâ€™s reasonable to push it to four 5s, hoping the other player also has at least two.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s, and I have 5 in my hand. I can safely increase the quantity to 5 5s, maintaining the same digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I see only 2 fives in my hand. For the total to be at least 5, the other player would need 3 or more fives in their 8 digits, which seems unlikely. I will challenge the bid rather than increase it further.
