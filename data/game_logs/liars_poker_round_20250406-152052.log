Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the opening bid, and I have two 8s, two 7s, and two 6s. A conservative but solid opening bid is 2 8s, reflecting my own hand strength. This sets a baseline and pressures the opponent to either increase the quantity or bid a higher digit.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I can see my own hand: 11332906. I have one 8 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 8, it's possible that there's at least one more 8 in the other player's hand, making the bid plausible. I will increase the quantity to make a new bid. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable next step as it is a minimal increase.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which means there needs to be at least one more 8 in Player 1's hand. Since that's quite plausible, challenging now would be risky. A safe and strategic move is to increase the quantity by one, bidding 4 8s, as it puts pressure on Player 1 and is consistent with the likelihood of at least two more 8s in their hand (which is possible but less certain).
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I can see my own hand: 11332906. I have one 8 in my hand. The total count of 8s must be at least 2 (one from me and at least one from the other player). Bidding 4 9s is a valid move as it is higher than 4 8s. I am increasing the digit, which makes it a valid bid. It's also a reasonable guess that there might be more digits other than 8 in the opponent's hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s, two 9s, two 7s, and two 6s. The current bid is 4 9s. Since I hold two 9s myself, for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need at least two more 9s in their hand, which is plausible but somewhat unlikely given the distribution. Alternatively, I could make a higher bid, but bidding 4 9s already seems risky. Given the improbability of there being four or more 9s total, I will challenge.
