Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, the digit '2' appears twice, and '0' appears once, while the other digits appear only once each. A good opening bid is usually on a digit I have multiple of, to increase the likelihood that the total count is higher. Therefore, opening with '2' makes sense, as I have two of them, and it's likely my opponent has at least one or two as well. I will start with a conservative but solid opening bid of 2 twos ('2 2').

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. Since I have zero 2s, the opponent must have at least two 2s for their bid to hold, which is uncertain. To safely escalate without relying on guessing, I can bid on a higher digit (7) with the same quantity. My hand contains two 7s, so even if the opponent has none, the bid of 2 7s is valid. This minimizes risk compared to challenging while maintaining a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (16022589), I have zero 7s. Since there are 16 digits total and I have none, all 7s must be in Player 1's hand. The current bid is 2 7s, which is plausible if Player 1 has exactly two 7s. However, since I have zero and it's somewhat unlikely Player 1 has both 7s (only a ~10% chance), challenging is a reasonable choice. Making a higher bid on 7s would be risky, and bidding on a different digit is difficult because the quantity must be at least 3 or 2 of a higher digit. I have three 2s, so bidding 3 2s is a safe and valid higher bid, exceeding the current 2 7s. This also puts pressure on Player 1, who may not have many 2s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. You have no 2s in your hand (your digits: 1,3,0,4,9,7,1,7). The opponent must have all the 2s. To have a valid bid of 3 2s, they need at least 3. The probability of them having 3 or more 2s in their 8 digits is low (~3.8%). Challenging has a high chance of success.
