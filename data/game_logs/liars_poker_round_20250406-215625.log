Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 0s. Since I can confirm that there are at least 2 0s in total from my hand, I can safely bid 5 0s, which is a valid higher bid than the current one.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Since the current bid is 5, I need to bid at least 6 0s or 5 of a higher number. I see two 9s in my hand. I can bid 6 0s or 5 9s. I'll bid 6 0s.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have two 0s in my hand, which means I can confidently bid at least 7 0s. I will raise the quantity to 7 while keeping the digit the same, as this is a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 0S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 7 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. There are 16 total digits. It's plausible there are at least 7 zeros. I don't have enough information to confidently challenge. I will bid slightly higher to keep playing. I'll bid 8 0s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 8 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 0s. I have two 0s in my hand, which means there are at least 10 0s possible when considering my hand and the opponent's. Therefore, I can confidently bid 9 0s, which is a valid higher bid than 8 0s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 0S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 9 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. It is possible that there are at least 9 zeros in total. However, the bidding has been steadily increasing on zeros. To raise the bid, I could bid 10 0s. Given that I only have one zero, it might be safer to bid on a different number. I have two 9s. I can bid 10 0s or I can bid 4 9s. Given the history of increasing zeros, bidding 10 0s is risky. I will bid 4 9s. This is a safe bid.
