Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 3s, two 5s, one 8, and one 6. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 7s, reflecting the two 7s I hold and leaving room for future escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. Bidding 2 8s increases the digit to 8, which is higher than 7, making it a valid higher bid. I have one 8 in my hand, so if the opponent has at least one 8, the bid holds. This avoids increasing the quantity while leveraging a higher digit, reducing the risk of overestimating the total count.

Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (37573865), I have two 8s. Since the current bid is 2 8s, and I already hold two of them, it is quite likely there are at least two 8s in total. To increase the bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit beyond 8 is impossible, so the only valid next bid is 3 of any digit. Given I have three 7s in my hand, bidding 3 7s is a strong and safe move supported by my hand.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I have one 8, and if the opponent has two 8s, the total would be 3. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit). While risky, it avoids increasing the quantity to 4, which might be harder to justify.

Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '37573865', I have two 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, so I know of at least two, meaning the opponent would need to have at least one 8 to make the bid true. This is plausible, so challenging now carries risk. To raise, I can either bid 3 9s or 4 of any digit. I have three 7s, so bidding 4 7s is a reasonable next move, as it increases the quantity and is supported by my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. Bidding 4 8s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Since I have one 8 in my hand (from 09714486), this could pressure the opponent to either challenge or continue escalating. Challenging risks losing if the total 7s are exactly 4 (if they have 3 7s), making the bid valid. Bidding higher on 8s is safer than challenging given the bid history and possible card counts.

Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 37573865, I have two 8s. The current bid is 4 8s, which would require at least two more 8s in Player 1's hand. Since each player has 8 digits, it's unlikely Player 1 has two or more 8s on top of mine. The probability of a total of 4 or more 8s is low, making it a good opportunity to challenge.
