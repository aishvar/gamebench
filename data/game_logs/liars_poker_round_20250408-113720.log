Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have 1 2 in my hand. The current bid of 2 2s seems plausible, but I can potentially increase the quantity to 3, considering the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. However, I don't have any other 2s in my hand, and the current bid is already at the minimum, so I should challenge to gather more information.
