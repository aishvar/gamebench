Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid, I need to make the first bid. My hand is 32450870, which contains the digits 3, 2, 4, 5, 0, 8, 7, 0. I have two 0s, one 7, and one 8. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and a digit that is relatively common or one that I have. I have two 0s, so bidding on 0s seems like a good start. A quantity of 3 or 4 for 0s seems plausible given that there are 16 digits in total. I'll start with bidding 3 0s, as it's a conservative start and gives room for the next player to act.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have a lot of high digits, I'll increase the digit. I can bid 3 2s, which is a valid higher bid.
