Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 3, two 5s, one 6, one 7, and two 8s. The best opening bid leverages my strong digits. I have two 5s and two 8s, so starting with a conservative but credible bid involving those digits makes sense. I'll bid 2 8s, reflecting my hand strength and setting a reasonable opening.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 5, 6, 5, 0, 3, 8, 7, 3. I have zero 9s, so the current bid of 2 9s relies entirely on the opponent having at least two 9s, which is unlikely given only 8 digits on their side. Since I hold no 9s, I think it's a good spot to challenge the bid, as the probability they have at least two 9s is low.
