Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand (01399464), the most frequent digits are '4' and '9', each appearing twice. To start conservatively and credibly, I will bid on a digit I have multiple of, maximizing my chances that the total count is at least this number. Therefore, I will open with a bid of 2 nines.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. Based on my hand (53295626), I have only one '9'. The total number of '9's across both players' hands is likely low. Challenging the bid is a strategic move to test the validity of Player 0's claim.
