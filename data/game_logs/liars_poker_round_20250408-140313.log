Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to start the bidding. I have a total of 8 digits in my hand, including two 4s. I can confidently bid 2 4s, as this is a reasonable starting point based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. In my hand, I have no 4s, which makes it less likely that there are at least two 4s across both hands. However, this is still plausible given the total of 16 digits in play. To avoid challenging too early and to keep the game progressing, I will make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and changes the digit to one I have strong evidence for.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s and two 3s in my hand, but no 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, which I cannot support with my hand. However, I can make a valid higher bid by increasing the quantity to 4 and bidding on a digit I have, such as 4s. This is a reasonable strategy since I have two 4s in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s, and I have no 4s in my hand. This means Player 0 is relying on a substantial number of 4s in their hand. Given that there are 16 total digits and I see none of the bid digit, it seems plausible but risky to challenge. However, since I have two 6s, I can safely increase the bid to 4 6s, maintaining the same quantity but switching to a digit I have in my hand, which could pressure Player 0 into overbidding or making a mistake.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s and two 3s in my hand, but I have no 6s. The current bid is 4 6s, which I believe is unlikely considering I have no 6s. I should challenge this bid.
