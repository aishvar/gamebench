Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 21006733, I notice that I have multiple occurrences of the digit '0' and '3', but since I'm starting, I should make a conservative yet reasonable bid. Bidding on a digit I have the most of or one that is common could be a good strategy. However, without knowing the opponent's hand, it's a bit of a gamble. I'll choose a digit I have at least one of and make a low to moderate bid, considering the total possible count of any digit across both hands could be up to 16. Since I have a '0', a '1', two '3's, and other digits, bidding on one of these seems reasonable. Given the digits in my hand and aiming for a moderate start, bidding on the '3's could be a good starting point because I have two of them, suggesting there could potentially be more across both hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 06826827, containing digits 0, 6, 8, 2, 6, 8, 2, and 7. I have no digit '3' in my hand. The current bid is 4 3s, meaning the opponent expects at least four '3's total across both hands. Since I have none, the opponent would need all four '3's in their eight-digit hand alone. While possible, the probability is relatively low. However, without any '3's myself, it's plausible they might have multiple '3's. Still, bidding higher would require me to commit to five of another digit or four of a higher digit, neither of which I have strong evidence for. Given the uncertainty and my lack of '3's, challenging the current bid seems like the most reasonable action.
