--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. Bidding 4 8s assumes the opponent has at least one 8, making the total plausible. Starting with a higher digit (8) and a quantity just above my own count puts pressure on the opponent to either challenge or raise, while leaving room for potential bluffing.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. Given my hand is 96790227, I have a total of 2 eights. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. Since the current bid is 4 8s, and I have only 2 eights in my hand, I will challenge this bid as it seems highly unlikely that the other player has 4 or more 8s in total, especially considering that there are only 16 digits in total across both players' hands.
