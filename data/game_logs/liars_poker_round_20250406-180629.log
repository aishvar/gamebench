Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid and I have to make the first move, I'll analyze my hand. My hand is 98414186. I count the digits: 9, 8, 4, 1, 4, 1, 8, 6. The most frequent digit in my hand is '1' and '8' and '4', each appearing twice. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative and based on my hand. I have a total of 2 '8's. Assuming the other player might have at least one '8', bidding '4 8s' seems like a good starting point as it is a slight overestimation but still reasonable.
