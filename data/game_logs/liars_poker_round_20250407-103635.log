Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, and I know I hold one, it's quite likely that at least one 0 exists between both hands, making a challenge unwise. A minimal higher bid would be 1 1s, but I see I also have one 1, so bidding 1 1s is safe and strictly higher than 1 0s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (4,3,9,5,1,7,0,6), I have zero 2s. Since the current bid is only 1 2s, it's quite plausible that the opponent has at least one 2, making a challenge risky. The minimal safe move is to increment the digit to 1 3s, which is a strictly higher bid and supported by the one 3 in my hand. This keeps the pressure on Player 0 without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 43951706, which contains one 4. The current bid is 1 4s, so at least one 4 among all 16 digits is plausible. Since I hold one 4 myself, the bid is safe, and challenging would likely lose. To keep the game progressing, I can confidently increase the bid to 1 5s, as I also hold a 5, making that bid reasonable and strictly higher (same quantity, higher digit).
