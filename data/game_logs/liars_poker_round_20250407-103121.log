Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. The current bid is 1 0s, which is plausible, but I cannot challenge yet since it's the opening bid. To make a strictly higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since increasing the digit to 1 while keeping the quantity at 1 is the minimal valid raise, and I have one 1 in my hand (which I don't), but since I don't have any 1s, it might be safer to bid on a digit I actually hold multiple of. I have two 5s and two 7s. Bidding 2 5s is a natural and safe increase, supported by my hand. Therefore, my best move is to bid 2 5s.
