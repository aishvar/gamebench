Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there's no current bid, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 36763118, I notice I have two 6s and two 1s, among other digits. Since I have to make a bid that is strictly higher than 'None', I can start with a low quantity and a digit I have in my hand. Bidding on a digit I possess gives me some confidence, but I should also consider the total possible count of any digit across both hands is up to 16. Starting with a low but reasonable quantity for a digit I have seems prudent.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 5, 0, 5, 3, 9, 8, 7, 1. I have no 6s at all. The current bid is 2 6s, so for this to be valid, the opponent must have at least 2 6s in their hand. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely, but not unreasonable to expect 2 6s in 8 digits. Since the bid is relatively low and plausible, challenging now carries risk. Instead, I will make a minimal higher bid that puts pressure back on the opponent by increasing the digit to 7, with the same quantity.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 2 7s and looking at my hand (36763118), I notice I have one 7. Since the bid is about the total count across both players' hands, and without knowing Player 1's hand, it's difficult to assess the likelihood of there being at least two 7s. However, considering the nature of Liar's Poker, which involves bluffing and strategic guessing, and the fact that the current bid is relatively low, I should consider making a higher bid based on a digit I have a good count of in my hand or challenging if I believe the current bid is unlikely. Given my hand has no digits with a higher count than 2 (except for 1s and possibly other digits not visible), and the current bid is on 7s, a safe strategy would be to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 7, increasing the quantity of 7s might not be the best strategy without more information. However, I can consider bidding on a different digit where I have a higher or equal count, or challenge the current bid if it seems improbable. Looking at my hand again, I see I have two 1s, two 3s, and two 6s. The highest digit I can bid on with confidence, considering the current bid, would be to match the quantity but increase the digit, which is not feasible since 7 is already bid, or increase the quantity of a digit I have. Since challenging seems risky without a clear indication that the bid is false, and given that I have a couple of digits with a count of 2, I could consider bidding on one of those digits if I were to increase the quantity. But given the current bid is on 7s and I only have one 7, my best move, considering strategic play and the information I have, would be to challenge the bid if I think it's unlikely there are at least two 7s in both hands combined, or find a suitable digit to bid on. Given these considerations and looking to make a move that is strategically sound, I decide to focus on the challenge aspect due to the uncertainty and the relatively low bid.
