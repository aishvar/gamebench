--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 6s, two 4s, one 2, one 7, and one 8. A safe opening bid would be 2 of a digit I have multiple of. Choosing 2 6s leverages my two 6s and is a conservative but reasonable start.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7, so combined with Player 1's hand, there need to be at least two 7s, which matches the current bid. Increasing the bid by quantity to 3 7s is reasonable since it is likely Player 1 has at least one 7, or I can safely assume some chance of that. Alternatively, I could bid 2 8s, which is a higher digit but same quantity. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, one 7, and one 8. Bidding 3 7s leverages the fact I already hold one 7 and is a conservative but valid higher bid.
