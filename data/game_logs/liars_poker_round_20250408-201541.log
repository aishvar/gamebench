Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Statistically, across 16 digits, there is likely at least one 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as well. Since I have two 4s and two 6s, a safe incremental bid would be 1 4s or 1 6s, but since those are equal in quantity to the current bid, I must increase the digit. Therefore, I can outbid with '1 1s', '1 2s', etc., or increase the quantity. I will bid '1 8s' since I have one 8, making it a safe minimal raise.
