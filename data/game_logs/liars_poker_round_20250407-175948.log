Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid as the current bid is 'None'. My hand is 06132014. I have two 0s and two 1s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. A reasonable opening strategy is to bid based on the digits I hold. Bidding 'two 0s' is plausible, as I possess two 0s myself, and it's statistically likely the opponent has at least one 0 among their 8 digits. This bid sets a baseline and forces the opponent to react.

--- Turn: Player 1 (quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 zeros. Looking at my hand, 58187929, I have zero zeros. For the total to be at least 2 zeros, the opponent would need to have both zeros, which is plausible but not guaranteed. Since zeros are relatively rare and I have none, challenging here is reasonable. Alternatively, I can make a safe higher bid based on digits I do have. Notably, I have two 8s and two 9s. Therefore, bidding 3 of a digit I have multiple of is safer than challenging now. I have two 8s, so a bid of 3 8s is plausible. However, since I only have two 8s, and the opponent would need at least one more 8, which is likely, bidding 3 8s is a reasonable next step.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 06132014. I have zero 8s. The current bid is '3 8s', made by Player 1. For this bid to be true, Player 1 must have at least three 8s in their 8-digit hand, as I contribute none. The probability of a single player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively low (roughly 1.6 expected 8s across all 16 digits). Since I have none, the burden falls entirely on Player 1. Player 1's jump from my '2 0s' to '3 8s' is aggressive. Given the statistics and my hand composition, challenging the bid seems more likely to succeed than making a higher bid like '4 0s' (requiring two 0s from Player 1) or '3 9s' (requiring three 9s from Player 1, which is equally unlikely).
