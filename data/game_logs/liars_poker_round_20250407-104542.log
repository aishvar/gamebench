Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 2s, two 1s, one 3, four 0s, one 3, one 1, one 2, one 4, and one 2. The most frequent digits in my hand are two 0s and three 2s. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 3 2s, as I already possess three 2s myself, making it likely there are at least three or more across both hands.
