Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 81659369, containing two 6s and two 9s. Since there is no current bid, I should start conservatively but confidently, bidding on digits I have multiple copies of. I'll bid 3 9s, as I already have two, making it likely that at least one more 9 exists in my opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. In my hand, I have one 9. For the bid to be valid, there would need to be at least two more 9s in Player 0's hand. While this is possible, it is also risky to challenge at this point since 3 9s is not an overly ambitious bid. To stay in the game and increase the pressure, I will bid 4 7s, as I have two 7s in my hand, making it likely that there are at least two more 7s in Player 0's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 8,1,6,5,9,3,6,9. I have no 7s. The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 1. With 16 digits total and none in my hand, all four 7s would have to be in Player 1's hand alone. This is possible but seems unlikely. Additionally, my previous bid of 3 9s was changed by Player 1 to a different digit (7), possibly indicating they don't have enough 9s. Given the risk, challenging seems prudent here.
