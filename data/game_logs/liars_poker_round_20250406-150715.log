Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I can make the first bid. I have the digits 54737541, and I notice that I have two 5s. A reasonable starting bid could be on the digit that I have the most of. I have two 5s, so bidding '2 5s' seems like a safe and reasonable initial bid as it reflects my hand's information.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 5s, so the current bid of 2 5s depends entirely on Player 0's hand. Since 2 is a low bid and plausible, challenging now would likely lose. Instead, I can safely increase the bid. I have two 6s and two 8s, making those digits strong candidates. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity by 1 and choosing a digit I hold multiple of, which strengthens the plausibility of my bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 5 and no 6s in my hand. The bid of 3 6s is not directly supported by my hand, but I can try to make a reasonable higher bid. Since I have a 5, I can bid on 5s. The next higher bid in quantity would be 4, and in digit would be 7s or higher. Bidding 4 5s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and keeps the digit relatively low, making it somewhat plausible given that my opponent might have some 5s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '36781602', I have zero 5s. The opponent's last bid is 4 5s. Since I have none, all four (or more) would have to be entirely in their hand, which is unlikely given 8 digits. The chance they hold 4 or more 5s is low, especially since they previously bid 2 5s and then raised to 4 5s, possibly bluffing or pressuring. Given my zero 5s, challenging is strategically sound.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
