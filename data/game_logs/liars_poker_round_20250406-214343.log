Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 1 0s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have one 0 in my hand, I know there's at least one 0. However, to make a strategic move, I should consider bidding on a digit I have more of, to increase the chances of my bid being valid. I have two 5s and three 3s in my hand. Bidding on the 5s seems like a reasonable choice because it increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid, leveraging the information from my hand.
