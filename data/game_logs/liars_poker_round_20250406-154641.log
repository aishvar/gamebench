--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 91384133, I notice I have three 3s, two 1s, two 8s, and one 4 and 9. The strongest starting bid is based on my three 3s, which gives me confidence to open with a reasonable bid. Opening with '3 3s' leverages my strong count of 3s without overcommitting early.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s and two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s. Bidding 4 8s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 9, 1, 3, 8, 4, 1, 3, 3. I have only one 8. The current bid is 4 8s, which means there must be at least four 8s across both hands. Since I have only one, the opponent would need to have at least three 8s for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution of digits, it is unlikely the opponent has three or more 8s in their eight digits. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
