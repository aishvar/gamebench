--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid of 3 4s is safe because even if the opponent has no 4s, the total (3) matches the bid. This forces the opponent to make a higher bid or challenge, which they would lose if they challenge now.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s. Since there are only 16 total digits in play, and I have one 4, the maximum possible 4s is 2 (if the other player also has one 4). Bidding 4 4s would be impossible, so I should challenge the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) challenges Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free)'s bid of 3 4s.
