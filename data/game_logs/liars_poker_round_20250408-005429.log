Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 0s, two 8s, one 4, one 5, one 6, and one 9. The most frequent digits in my hand are 2s, 0s, and 8s, each appearing twice. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand would be 2 2s, as it's likely there are at least two or more 2s across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 0, 4, 7, 1, 1, 6, 8, 3. I have zero 2s. The current bid is 2 2s, which requires there to be at least two 2s across both hands. Since I have none, all 2s would have to be in Player 0's hand. While it's possible Player 0 has two or more 2s, it's somewhat unlikely given the distribution. However, challenging now might be premature because 2 2s is a modest opening bid. Instead, I can raise to a safe, higher bid based on digits I do have. I have two 1s, so bidding 2 1s would not be higher (same quantity, lower digit). I also have one 0, so bidding 2 3s or 2 4s wouldn't be higher. The next strictly higher bid would be 3 1s, increasing the quantity by one and choosing a digit I have two of, making it plausible. This applies pressure on Player 0 and is supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 2, 6, 5, 2, 8, 4, 0, 9. I have zero 1s, so the current bid of 3 1s relies entirely on the opponent holding at least 3 1s, which is quite unlikely given they only have 8 digits. Since I have no 1s, the chance that there are 3 or more total is low, making this a good spot to challenge.
