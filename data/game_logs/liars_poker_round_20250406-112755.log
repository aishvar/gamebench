Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable bid. I have one 8 in my hand, which suggests that 8s might not be very common. However, I have two 0s, which could imply that 0s might be more frequent among all players. Bidding 5 0s seems like a safe starting point, as it's not too high to risk a challenge but also not too low to be easily beaten.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '0' in my hand (49425108). The current bid is 5 0s, which seems high given that there are only 32 digits in total across all players. The probability of there being at least five 0s is low, especially since I only have one. Therefore, challenging the bid is the most strategic move.
