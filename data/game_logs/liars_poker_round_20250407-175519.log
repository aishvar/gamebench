Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I have the opportunity to set the initial bid. Looking at my hand (04016238), the digit '0' appears twice, which is the highest count of any single digit in my hand. Given that the opponent could have additional '0's, a conservative initial bid of '2 0s' is reasonable. This bid is based on the known quantity in my hand and leaves room for the opponent to raise if they have more '0's.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 0s', made by Player 0. This is the lowest possible quantity bid on the lowest digit, making it a very weak opening. My hand is 79985132, which contains zero 0s. While I don't have any 0s, challenging this early, low bid is risky. Player 0 only needs two 0s in their 8-digit hand for the bid to be true, which is plausible. Therefore, making a higher bid is the safer option. I need to bid higher than '2 0s', meaning either a higher quantity of 0s (e.g., '3 0s') or the same quantity (2) of a higher digit (1-9). Looking at my hand, I have two 9s. Bidding '2 9s' is a safe and valid higher bid because the quantity (2) is the same as the current bid, but the digit (9) is higher than 0. Furthermore, this bid is guaranteed to be true based solely on my own hand, regardless of what Player 0 holds. This makes it a strong, low-risk move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given my hand (04016238), there are no 9s in my possession. The current bid is 2 9s, which means Player 1 is claiming there are at least two 9s across both hands. Since I have zero 9s, Player 1 must have at least two 9s in their hand. Given that the probability of Player 1 having two or more 9s in their 8-digit hand is relatively low (since there are only four 9s in the entire deck of 20 digits), it is statistically unlikely that the bid is accurate. Therefore, challenging the bid is the optimal move.
