Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game. I have two 4s in my hand. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 fours. This establishes a baseline and doesn't reveal too much about my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 5, 7, 0, 2, 4, 9, 3, and 6. There is one '4' in my hand. The current bid is '2 4s', which means Player 0 claims there are at least 2 fours among all players' hands. Given that I only have one '4' and there are only two players, it is unlikely that Player 0 has another '4' unless they have at least one more in their hand. Therefore, I believe that the bid of '2 4s' is unlikely to be valid. I will challenge this bid.
