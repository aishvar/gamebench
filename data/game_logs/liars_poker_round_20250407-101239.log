Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 4s, two 3s, one 5, and one 9. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 4s, as I hold two 4s myself, making it likely there are at least two 4s in total. This sets a solid foundation without overcommitting early.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 4s (digits: 3,8,4,8,4,3,5,9) and one 5. The current bid is 2 5s, which is plausible given I hold one 5 and the opponent might have one as well. A minimal safe raise is 2 6s, but since I have no 6s, that feels risky. However, I do have two 4s, so I can safely increase the quantity on 4s from the initial bid. The last bid on 4s was 2 4s, so the next valid bid must be at least 3 4s, which is reasonable since I already hold two 4s and it's plausible the opponent has at least one. Therefore, I will bid 3 4s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 38484359, I have two 4s and one 5. The current bid is 3 5s. Since I only have one 5, for the bid to be true, the opponent would need to have at least two 5s, which is possible but not certain. Alternatively, I can raise the bid. I know I have two 4s, so a bid of 4 4s would require the opponent to have at least two 4s, which is plausible and strategically pressures them. This is a safer incremental bid based on my hand strength.
