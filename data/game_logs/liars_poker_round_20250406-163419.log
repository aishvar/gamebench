Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 6s, two 0s, one 4, one 3, and one 5. A safe and strategic opening bid is '2 7s' because I hold two 7s myself, making it quite probable there are at least two total, and it sets a reasonable baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s, which means there must be at least two 7s across both hands. Given my hand and the likelihood that Player 0 has at least one 7, this bid seems plausible. To stay in the game, I need to make a higher bid. A reasonable next bid would be 3 7s, as it increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same, which aligns with the rules.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, so for that to be valid, my opponent would need to have at least one 7. This is plausible. To increase the bid, the next minimal bid would be 3 8s or 4 0s. Looking at my hand, I have no 8s, but I do have two 0s and two 6s. Bidding 4 0s seems risky as I only have two, and needing two more from the opponent is uncertain. Similarly, I only have one 5, so no strong basis there. Since the current bid of 3 7s is quite plausible and I lack strong evidence to safely raise, the best strategic move is to challenge and hope the opponent doesn't have at least one 7 to support the total of 3.
