Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player to bid, I need to establish an opening bid. My hand is 34802396. I have two 3s, which is the digit I hold the most of. With 16 total digits in play (2 players x 8 digits), the expected average count for any digit is 1.6. Since I already have two 3s, bidding '2 Threes' is a statistically reasonable and relatively safe opening bid. It reflects the composition of my hand without being overly aggressive or too conservative like a bid of '1'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. My hand has one '3', so the bid could be valid if the opponent has at least one '3'. To safely raise without lying, I can bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. My hand has two '8's. Bidding 2 8s is valid (since I have two) and exceeds the current bid by digit rank. This avoids challenging the risky 2 3s bid and secures a safer position.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 8s'. I have one '8' in my hand (34802396). For the bid to be true, Player 1 needs to have at least one '8' in their 8-digit hand. The probability of Player 1 having at least one '8' is reasonably high (estimated around 57%), making a challenge risky. I should make a higher bid. Options include increasing the digit ('2 9s') or increasing the quantity ('3 0s', '3 1s', etc.). I have two '3's in my hand. Bidding '3 3s' leverages this strength. This bid requires Player 1 to have at least one '3' for it to be true, which is also reasonably probable (~57%). This bid is stronger than '2 9s' (which only requires one '9' from Player 1, same as '2 8s' required one '8') because it increases the quantity and is based on the digit I hold most frequently. It puts more pressure on Player 1.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. To exceed it, I can either raise the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 8s (my hand: 75384428), bidding 3 8s is valid. The digit 8 is higher than 3, making this a stronger bid. Even if the opponent has no 8s, the bid could still hold if they have one, totaling three. This avoids challenging a bid that might be valid if they have two 3s (their initial bid of 2 3s suggests they might have at least some 3s).

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 34802396, containing one '8'. The current bid is '3 8s' made by Player 1. For this bid to be true, there must be at least three '8's across both hands (16 digits total). Since I have one '8', Player 1 must have at least two '8's for their bid to be accurate. Player 1 previously bid '2 8s' and then raised to '3 8s' after my bid of '3 3s'. This repeated bidding on '8's suggests they likely hold at least two '8's, making a challenge risky. Therefore, I should make a higher bid. The next possible bids are '4 8s' (increasing quantity) or '3 9s' (increasing digit). Bidding '4 8s' feels like a significant escalation, requiring Player 1 to have three '8's. A more standard and safer progression is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Bidding '3 9s' is a valid higher bid. I hold one '9', so this bid requires Player 1 to have at least two '9's, which is plausible and puts the pressure back on them.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand has no 9s, so the opponent must have at least 3. The probability of the opponent having 3 or more 9s in their 8-digit hand is low (only 3% chance for exactly 3, lower for more). Challenging is advantageous since their bid likely overestimates the actual count.
