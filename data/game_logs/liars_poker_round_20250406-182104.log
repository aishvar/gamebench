Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 0 in my hand (30935866). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 0, the total count of 0s across both hands is at least 1. Increasing the digit seems reasonable. I can bid 1 1s, which is a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 2s. I can see my own hand: 30935866. It contains one 2. Given that we have 8 digits each, the maximum number of 2s is 16. The current bid of 1 2s is quite conservative. I can bid higher. I have one 3 and two 6s, but no higher digits in significant quantities. A reasonable next step is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same or increase the quantity. Since I have a 3, bidding 1 3s is a safe and reasonable move as it increases the digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 4s. I have one 4 in my hand (30935866), so I know there's at least one more 4 out there. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I see a 3 and a 6 repeated, and a 5 and a 9, I can consider bidding on a digit that I have more of or a higher digit. I have two 6s and a 3, so bidding on 3s seems reasonable as it's the next higher bid and I have one 3. I'll bid 1 5s, increasing the digit.
