Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, which is the highest count among my digits. Since there are no previous bids, starting with a safe and reasonable bid based on my hand makes sense. Bidding 2 0s is a good opening move as it's supported by my hand and sets a foundation for the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze my hand (16741139) and the current state of the game. I don't have any 0s in my hand. The current bid is '2 0s', which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 2 zeros between both our hands. Since I have no zeros, all of those would have to be in Player 0's hand. This is certainly possible - they could easily have 2 or more zeros. Given I have no zeros, I should probably avoid bidding on zeros. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 7, and two 9s. I could bid on 1s or 9s with some confidence. I'll bid '3 1s' which is higher than '2 0s' and I already have 2 of those digits myself, so I only need Player 0 to have one more 1 for this to be true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 1s in my hand, so the total number of 1s must be in Player 1's hand. The current bid is 3 1s, which means Player 1 must have at least 3. However, without knowing their exact count, it's uncertain. Challenging is a good move because if Player 1 has fewer than 3, I win. If they have 3 or more, I lose. Given the uncertainty and the possibility of bluffing, challenging is a reasonable choice.
