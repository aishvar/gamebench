Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains digits 2, 5, 3, 8, 1, 9, 4, and 6, each appearing exactly once. Since there is no current bid, it's safest to start conservatively. I can confidently bid on a digit I already hold. I'll choose '1' as my digit and bid a low quantity to minimize risk, such as '2 1s', assuming the opponent might have at least one '1'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 67224467, I have zero 1s. The opponent bid '2 1s', claiming there are at least two 1s total. Since I have none, this means they would need to have at least two 1s in their hand for their bid to be true. While possible, I have good information to make a higher bid based on my own hand. I see two 4s, two 6s, and two 7s. Since I have two 4s, I can safely bid '2 4s', which is higher than '2 1s' because 4 is a higher digit than 1 with the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have exactly one '4' in my hand (digits: 2, 5, 3, 8, 1, 9, 4, 6), so I know at least one '4' exists. With 16 digits total, it's quite plausible that the opponent has at least one more '4', making the current bid reasonable. I also have multiple digits appearing once each, limiting my confidence in bidding higher on a specific digit. However, I can safely increase the digit while keeping the same quantity, minimizing risk. Since I have one '8', bidding '2 8s' is a reasonable next step that slightly raises the bid without substantial risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 67224467, I have three 4s, two 6s, two 7s, and one 2. I don't have any 8s, but the opponent only bid '2 8s'. Since there are 16 total digits in play, and I don't have any 8s in my hand, the opponent would need to have at least 2 8s in their hand for their bid to be true. While this is possible, I can make a safer bid based on what I know I have. I have three 4s in my hand, so bidding '3 4s' would be a valid higher bid that I'm certain exists.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand (25381946) contains exactly one '4'. The current bid is 3 '4s', meaning Player 1 believes there are at least two more '4s' in their hand. Given that Player 1 previously bid 2 '4s' and then increased to 3 '4s' after my bid of 2 '8s', it's plausible they have at least two '4s'. With my one '4', the total of three '4s' is possible. However, bidding higher (such as 3 '5s' or 4 '0s') would be risky since my hand only has one '5' and no digit repeats. Given the uncertainty and the reasonable plausibility of the current bid, but no safe higher bid available, challenging here is risky. But considering Player 1's confidence in '4s', it's safer to switch digits with a minimal increase. I have one '1', and previously bid on '1s', indicating I might safely bid slightly higher on a digit I hold. Therefore, bidding 3 '8s' is reasonable because I have one '8', and Player 1 did not contest my previous bid of 2 '8s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (67224467), I have three 4s, two 6s, two 7s, and one 2. I have no 8s in my hand. The opponent bid '3 8s', meaning they believe there are at least 3 eights total. Since I have zero 8s, they would need to have at least 3 eights in their hand of 8 digits for their bid to be valid. While possible, this seems unlikely as it would mean over 1/3 of their digits are 8s. Given this and my lack of 8s, challenging seems like the best move.
