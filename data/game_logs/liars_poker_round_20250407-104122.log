Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open with a bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 6s, one 3, one 5, one 0, and one 8. A safe opening bid is '2 1s', reflecting the two 1s I possess, which is likely to be a conservative yet solid start.
