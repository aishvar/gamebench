Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 9, one 4, one 2, one 7, one 3, one 6, and one 5 â€” all digits appear exactly once. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 of a common central digit like 3s, as statistically across both hands, it's likely there are at least two of any digit.
