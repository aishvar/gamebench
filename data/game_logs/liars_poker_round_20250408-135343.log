Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 13075825, I notice that I have two 5s. Since the goal is to make a bid that is likely to be true but also strategic, bidding on a digit I have multiple of seems wise. However, I should also consider the potential for the other player to have the same digit. Starting with a lower quantity and a digit I have in my hand seems like a safe start.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 87691674, which contains digits 8, 7, 6, 9, 1, 6, 7, and 4. I have no 5s in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s, meaning Player 0 believes there are at least two 5s among the 16 total digits. Although I have no 5s, it's still possible Player 0 has two or more 5s. Without any information contradicting this bid strongly, challenging seems risky. Instead, I'll make a conservative higher bid based on digits I have multiple of. I have two 7s and two 6s, making either '2 6s' or '2 7s' plausible. However, since the current bid is '2 5s', my next bid must be strictly higherâ€”either '2 6s' or '2 7s' would be acceptable, but '2 7s' is safer as I already have two 7s myself, ensuring the bid's accuracy even without relying on the opponent's digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 2 7s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Looking at my hand, 13075825, I notice I have one 7 and no 8s or 9s. Since I only have one 7, bidding higher on 7s would be risky. However, I can try to bid on a lower digit with a higher quantity or the same digit with a higher quantity. Considering the bid history started with 2 5s and moved to 2 7s, and given that my hand contains two 5s, I could potentially bid on 5s with a higher quantity than 2, or move to a higher digit. But since I only have one 7 and no higher digits in significant numbers, my safest bet to ensure a higher bid is to increase the quantity of a digit I have more of, like 5s, or challenge if I think 2 7s is unlikely. Given I have no information about Player 1's hand and my own hand does not strongly support the existence of many 7s, challenging seems like a reasonable strategy, especially since the jump to 2 7s might be speculative.
