--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 7, one 9, and one more 0 (actually two 0s). The most frequent digit in my hand is 0, appearing twice. Starting with a conservative and reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 0s, reflecting my hand and leaving room to escalate.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s and two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 2 0s. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable move, as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid. Additionally, it's plausible given the digits in my hand.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6. The current bid is 3 6s, which is plausible since I might expect my opponent to have two or more 6s, but it's also risky to assume more. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since 3 7s would be a higher bid with the same quantity, and I have one 7 in my hand, this seems like a safe incremental increase without overcommitting.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 7s in my hand, which makes a bid of 4 7s reasonable. This bid increases the quantity from the current bid and maintains the same digit. Challenging seems risky since I have two 7s myself, suggesting there might be enough 7s in total.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 7s (digits 7 and 7). The current bid is 4 7s, which would require there to be at least two additional 7s in Player 1's hand. Given that 7s are relatively rare and I already hold two, it's unlikely they have two more. Therefore, challenging this bid is the best strategic move.
