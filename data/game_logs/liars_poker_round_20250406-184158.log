--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I see one of each digit except 1, 3, 7, and 9. A safe opening bid is 2 of a digit I have at least one of. I have one 4 and one 6, so I will start with a conservative bid of 2 4s, expecting that the opponent likely has at least one 4 as well.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand, making the total potentially two if the opponent has one. Challenging the bid of 2 4s is risky because if the total is two, I lose. However, if the opponent is bluffing and has zero 4s, I win. Given the uncertainty and the potential that the opponent might have one, challenging seems like a reasonable move to test their bid.
