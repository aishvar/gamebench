Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make an initial bid. I have one of each digit in my hand. Bidding 2 5s is a reasonable starting point, assuming the other player might have at least one 5.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. My hand is 29416626, which contains no digit '5'. However, since I don't have any '5's, the likelihood that the opponent has at least two '5's is uncertain but plausible, given they have eight unknown digits. Challenging at this low bid is risky because it's reasonable the opponent might have two '5's. Instead, I will make a safe incremental bid. My hand has three '6's, making it quite likely that there are at least three '6's in total. Thus, bidding '3 6s' is a safer and more strategic choice.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s, and I have no 6s in my hand. Since I have none, the total count of 6s can only be what Player 1 has. Given that the expected number of 6s in a hand is low, challenging this bid is a strategic move to test its validity.
