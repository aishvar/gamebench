Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can start with any valid bid. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 3 4s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 4.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have a 4 in my hand, but I also have other high-value digits like 3 and 6. I should make a bid that increases the quantity or digit, but not too aggressively. I notice that the digit 5 is not represented in the current bid, so I'll make a bid that increases the digit to 5.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 4s and two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. Since I have three 6s, I can confidently bid 4 6s, which is a higher bid than 3 5s.

Player 0 bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s, which is higher in digit but the same in quantity as my previous bid. I can make a higher bid in digit by bidding 4 7s.

Player 1 bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. I can bid 5 7s, increasing the quantity of the current bid digit. Alternatively, I could challenge, but since I have two 7s, it's more strategic to bid higher.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 0 bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have a 7 in my hand. A bid of 6 7s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 7S'
Player 1 bids: 6 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. While I can't be certain of the other player's digits, bidding 7 7s seems reasonable as it's a small increase in quantity and the digit is the same. This bid is likely to be safe and forces the other player to either challenge or make a higher bid.

Player 0 bids: 7 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. Looking at my hand, I have 3 7s. Since the current bid is only 7 7s, I should increase the quantity to 8 7s, as that's the maximum I can reasonably bid based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 7S'
Player 1 bids: 8 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 7s. I have no 7s in my hand, but I do have three 4s and two 6s. Since the opponent has bid high on 7s, it's possible they have several 7s. Challenging seems risky. Bidding 9 4s is a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity while using a digit I know I have.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 4S'
Player 0 bids: 9 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 9 4s. Bidding 10 5s seems reasonable, increasing quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 5S'
Player 1 bids: 10 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 5s. I have two 5s in my hand. While it's possible for the other player to have up to 8 5s, it's unlikely. Challenging seems risky, so I'll try to make a reasonable bid. I have three 4s in my hand, so bidding 11 4s is a strategic move, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit relatively low.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 12 4s. I have two 4s in my hand. It's unlikely that there are 12 4s in total. Challenging seems like the best move.
