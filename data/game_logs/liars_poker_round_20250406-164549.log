Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a mix of digits in my hand, but none appear more than twice. The current bid is None, so I need to make the first bid. I'll start with a conservative bid of 2 5s, as it's a common digit and I have a 5 in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, so the current bid of 2 5s relies entirely on the opponent having at least two 5s, which is plausible. To increase the bid, I should either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity on a higher digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s and two 9s, so a safe and natural next bid would be 2 6s or 2 7s, but even better, I can bid 2 8s, matching the quantity but with a higher digit, which is a valid higher bid and supported by my hand.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, so for that bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least one 8. While that's plausible, pushing the bid higher would require the opponent to have even more 8s, which is less likely. Since I already have two 8s, a bid of 4 8s would only be reasonable if I believe the opponent has at least two 8s, which is unlikely given probabilities. Therefore, challenging the bid of 3 8s is the best move.
