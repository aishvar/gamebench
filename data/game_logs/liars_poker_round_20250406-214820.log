Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have two 2s, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 8, and two 0s in my hand. A safe starting bid would be based on the digits I have. I will start with a low bid of 2 0s, as I have two 0s in my hand and it's a reasonable starting point.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '2 0s' and examining my hand '00467588', I notice I have two 0s. This already matches the current bid quantity. Considering the bidding rules, to make a higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same or higher quantity. Since I have two 0s and no information about the other player's hand, bidding on a higher digit seems more reasonable. Looking at my hand, I see I have one 4, one 6, one 7, one 5, and two 8s. The highest digit I can bid on with confidence, given I don't know the other player's hand, would be the 8, but since I only have two 8s, I need to consider if bidding '2 8s' would be a safe move, given it's the highest digit I can confidently bid on without overestimating. However, since my goal is to make a bid that is strictly higher than '2 0s' and considering the digits available in my hand, bidding on '2 8s' seems like a viable option because it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, adhering to the rules for a higher bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 2 8s

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 3 8s would be a reasonable increase, as it's a higher quantity of the same digit. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have two 3s, two 2s, one 0, and one 6. Bidding 3 3s is a valid option, as it's higher than 2 8s. However, since I have a single 8, it's more strategic to bid 3 8s, hoping my opponent also has at least one 8. Bidding 3 9s is also a possibility, but less likely to be successful given the limited information.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s. Given that I already have two 8s, it's possible that the other player also has at least one 8, making the current bid plausible. However, I don't have any information about the other player's hand that would suggest they have more than one 8. Since I need to make a strictly higher bid, I could increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit is not feasible since 8 is already the highest digit bid. Therefore, I should increase the quantity to make a higher bid, considering the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and the likelihood of having more 8s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Given the bid history shows a previous bid of 3 8s, and then a raise to 4 8s, it's plausible, but still risky. I could bid higher, but I don't have many of any other digits to confidently increase the quantity. I will challenge the bid, as 4 8s seems optimistic given my hand and the previous bids.
