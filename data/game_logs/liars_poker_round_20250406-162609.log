Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid, I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (08935168), I count the occurrences of each digit. I have: 0(1), 8(2), 9(1), 3(1), 5(1), 1(1), 6(1). The most frequent digit in my hand is 8, with 2 occurrences. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and consider the total count across both hands. Assuming the opponent has a similar distribution, bidding on 8s seems promising. I will bid 3 8s, slightly higher than my count, anticipating that my opponent might have at least one 8.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. Given that the current bid is 3 8s, I can increase the quantity or the digit. I have a 8 in my hand, and I also have higher digits available. However, I should be cautious about the possibility of Player 0 having multiple 8s or higher digits. My hand contains two 8s, and bidding 4 8s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I had bid 3 8s previously, and upon reviewing my hand (08935168), I see that I have one 8. It's possible that the other player has three or more 8s, making the total count of 8s four or more. However, given that I have one 8, it's reasonable to believe that the total count could be higher than 4, but it's a bit of a stretch to bid much higher without more information. I can bid 4 9s, which is a higher bid than 4 8s because it has the same quantity but a higher digit. This action is based on the rules that allow increasing the digit to make a higher bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider my hand and the current bid. My hand contains one 9, and I can see that bidding a higher quantity or digit could be advantageous. The bid history shows that 8s have already been bid, so increasing the quantity or digit seems reasonable. I have a 5, 6, 7, 3, 3, 4, 8, and 6 in my hand. I can see there's a possibility of having higher digits or quantities. A bid of 5 8s seems reasonable as I have an 8 in my hand and it's a higher digit than 9, but I should be cautious about overbidding. A safer approach would be to bid something I know exists, like 5 8s or increase the quantity of a lower digit. However, I can also try to increase the quantity or digit slightly. I have one 8 in my hand, so bidding 5 8s could be risky but seems higher than 4 9s considering the distribution and my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity and bid a higher digit. Since the maximum quantity is 16 and there are 16 digits in total, bidding 6 8s is a possibility but it might be too high given I have only one 8. I can also bid a higher digit with the same quantity. Bidding 5 9s is a valid move as it is higher than 5 8s. However, I should consider if I have a 9 or if it's likely that the other player has many 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, making 5 9s a reasonable bid as it's within the realm of possibility that the total count of 9s could be 5 or more.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 5, 6, 7, 3, 3, 8, 4, 6. I have no 9s, so I cannot increase the count of 9s. However, I can bid on a different digit. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and since there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in Player 0's, I should consider bidding on a digit that could reasonably exist in both hands. The current bid is 5 9s, so I need to make a bid that is either higher in quantity or digit. I have two 6s and two 8s in my hand, but no 9s. A reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity or digit. Since I have two 6s and no 9s, I could bid on 6s. The current bid is 5 9s, so I need to bid higher than 5. I also see that bidding 6 6s could be a possibility since I have two 6s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have a lot of 6s, I'll check the next higher digit. Bidding 6 7s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit, and it's a relatively safe bid given the current state of the game.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 6 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I need to make a higher bid. I have the digits 5, 6, 7, 3, 3, 8, 4, 6 in my hand. I can see that bidding a higher quantity with a lower digit or a higher digit with the same or lower quantity could be strategic. Since the current bid is 6 7s, I should consider if I can make a valid higher bid. I have two 6s, and bidding 7 6s seems reasonable as it's higher in quantity than 6 7s and I have the digits to support it.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have seen one 6 in my hand and the bid is for 7 6s, it's possible that there are 6 more 6s in the other hands. However, I can bid 7 7s, which is a higher bid because the digit is higher. This seems like a reasonable action given the information I have.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 7 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. I have two 7s in my hand, which could potentially make the bid valid if I have enough 7s across both hands or if my opponent has a lot of 7s. However, I also have other digits that could be used to make a higher bid. Since my hand contains a 6 and a 7, and I know that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I should consider if there's a higher digit or quantity that I can bid on. The current bid is 7 7s, so I need to go higher than 7. I can bid 8 0s as 0 is lower than 7 and I can have a higher quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 8 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, so the total count of 0s is at least 1. Given that there are 16 digits in total and the bid is 8 0s, it's possible but seems high. However, I can bid higher by increasing the digit. Since I have no 1s, bidding 8 2s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit and keeps the quantity the same, making it a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 2S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 8 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 2s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 5, 6, 7, 3, 3, 8, 4, 6. I have a total of 8 digits. The bid of 8 2s seems high but I need to assess the likelihood of it being true or not. I also need to consider if I can make a valid higher bid. The current bid is 8 2s, so I need to bid higher than 8 or have a higher digit with the same or lower quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 9 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 3s. My hand is 08935168, which contains one 3. To determine the likelihood of the bid being true, I need to consider the total count of 3s. I have one 3, and there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand, making 16 in total. If I have one 3, the opponent must have at least 8 more 3s for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution, it's highly unlikely that the opponent has 8 3s. However, I should consider the bidding history and the fact that the opponent made this bid. The history suggests a pattern of competitive bidding. I will challenge the bid as it seems improbable.
