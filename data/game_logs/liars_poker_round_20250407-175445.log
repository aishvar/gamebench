Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 64317264. I have two 4s and two 6s, which are my most frequent digits. With two players and 8 digits each, there are 16 digits in total. The expected number of any specific digit is 1.6. As the first bidder, I want to make a plausible bid based on my hand. I have two 4s. Bidding '3 4s' is a reasonable opening bid. It's slightly aggressive but plausible, as it only requires the opponent to have at least one 4 among their 8 digits, which is statistically likely (approx. 57% chance). This bid establishes a claim without being overly risky.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand has two 4s (from 94338997). Given that Player 0 bid 3 4s, they must have at least one 4 in their hand for the bid to be valid. Since I have two 4s, it's plausible they have one, making the total 3. However, since I don't know their hand, I can either bid higher or challenge. A higher bid would be 4 of any digit (since 4 > 3 in quantity), but I don't have strong evidence to support a higher bid. Alternatively, I could challenge if I think they're bluffing. Given the uncertainty, I'll make a conservative higher bid on a digit I have more of (9s).

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 64317264. I have zero 9s. The current bid is 4 9s, made by Player 1. For this bid to be true, Player 1 must have at least four 9s in their 8-digit hand, as I have none. The probability of a single player having four or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively low (expected value is 0.8). Given I hold none of the bid digit, the likelihood of the opponent holding at least four is significantly reduced. Bidding higher would require me to bid at least 5 of a digit. My best quantities are two 4s and two 6s. Bidding '5 4s' or '5 6s' would require the opponent to have three of that digit, which is still a significant amount. Given the unlikelihood of the opponent holding four 9s, challenging is the statistically safer and more logical move.
