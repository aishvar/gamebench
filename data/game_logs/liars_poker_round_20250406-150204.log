Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable bid. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s is a safe starting point, as it's likely there are at least three 8s among all players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. Given that I have no information about the other players' hands and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24, I need to make a reasonable bid that is higher than the current bid. My hand contains the digits 6, 4, 9, 7, 6, 8, 3, and 6. I have a total of 3 sixes and one 8. Since the current bid is 3 8s and I have one 8, I should consider a bid that is higher but also plausible given the total number of digits in play. I can see if I increase the quantity or the digit, I can make a valid bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 8s at all. The current bid is 4 8s, which requires at least four 8s among the 24 digits. Since I hold zero, the other two players must collectively have at least four 8s, which is somewhat unlikely given the average expected count would be about 2.4 (24 digits divided equally among 10 digits). Given the prior bids escalated from 3 to 4 8s quickly, and my complete lack of 8s, I suspect the bid is an overstatement. Therefore, challenging now is the optimal move.
