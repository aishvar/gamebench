Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player to bid, I should start with a conservative yet credible opening bid. Looking at my hand, the digit '8' appears twice, and '4' also appears twice. Since there are a total of 16 digits in play (8 mine + 8 opponent's), it's statistically reasonable to assume that most digits appear at least once or twice overall. Bidding 2 of a digit I hold twice is a safe and standard opening bid, as it's supported entirely by my hand and likely not challengeable immediately.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 2 8s, I need to make a higher bid that exceeds either the quantity (2) or the digit (8). Since my hand contains 4 digits that are 8s, I can confidently make a higher bid. I'll choose a digit that is likely to be high and has a good chance of being exceeded by the other player. In this case, I'll bid on the digit 9, which is the highest possible digit. My hand has 1 digit that is 9, so I'm not risking much. I'll bid 1 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s, which means there are at least 2 eights in the game. Given my hand 06503399, I have one eight. I can make a valid higher bid by bidding on a different digit or a higher quantity of the same digit.

Player 1 bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (4,8,2,0,9,4,8,1), I have 1 '9'. The current bid is 3 nines. Since I have only 1, the opponent would need to have at least 2 or more '9's to make the bid valid. Given that players typically don't overbid early and the probability of having 2 or more '9's in the opponent's 8 digits is relatively low (about 20%), the bid of 3 nines is quite aggressive and likely an overstatement. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move.
