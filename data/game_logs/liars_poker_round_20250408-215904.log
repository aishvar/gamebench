Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, so it's reasonably likely there is at least one more 9 in the opponent’s hand. Bidding 3 9s seems like a good opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '3 9s' and decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge. Looking at my hand (89104330), I have only one 9. For there to be at least 3 9s total, my opponent would need to have at least 2 9s in their hand. While this is possible, it's not guaranteed. I have more information about other digits: I have two 3s, two 0s, and one each of 8, 9, 1, and 4. Since I need to make a higher bid, I could bid on digits I have multiple of (like '3 3s' or '3 0s'), but '3 3s' wouldn't be higher than '3 9s' since 3 < 9. I could bid '4 0s', '4 3s', or even '4' of another digit, but that would be risky if I don't have many. The safest option is to bid '4 0s' since I have two 0s already, meaning my opponent would only need two more for this to be true, which is reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I already have 2 nines in my hand. It’s plausible my opponent could have at least 2 more, making 4 total. The current bid of 4 0s doesn’t seem too high to call, so I’ll increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same to 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to assess the current bid of '4 9s'. Looking at my hand (89104330), I have only 1 nine. The opponent has claimed there are at least 4 nines total, which means they would need to have at least 3 nines in their hand. While possible, this seems somewhat unlikely. Let me analyze further: I have two 0s, one 1, one 3, two 3s, one 4, one 8, and one 9. If I were to bid, I'd need to go higher than 4 9s, which means either 5 of any digit or 4 of a digit higher than 9 (which isn't possible). I could bid 5 0s since I have 2 zeros, but the opponent would only need 3 more zeros for this to be true, which is certainly possible. Given that the opponent has raised to 4 9s after I bid 4 0s, they seem confident. However, requiring 3 nines in their hand is a relatively high concentration of a single digit. I think challenging is the better option here.
