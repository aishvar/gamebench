Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start with an opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 3s, two 4s, one 5, two 2s, one 6, and one 8. The most common digits in my hand are 2s, 3s, 4s, and 7s, each appearing twice. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be 2 of one of these digits. I'll choose 2 7s as my opening bid, reflecting my hand's strength.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, which already meets the current bid of 2 7s. Given that there are 16 digits in total and I know my hand, it is reasonable to assume that there could be at least 3 7s across both hands. Therefore, I will raise the bid to 3 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, which is plausible given my two 7s and the possibility that the opponent has at least one 7. Making a higher bid is reasonable since the total number of 7s could be more. The next minimal higher bid would be 3 8s, but I have only one 8. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 4 7s, supported partially by my two 7s and the reasonable chance the opponent has two more. Therefore, I will bid 4 7s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 7s. This means there need to be at least two more 7s in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. While it's possible they have two or more 7s, it's also plausible they don't, given the distribution of digits. I believe the bid is unlikely to hold, so I will challenge.
