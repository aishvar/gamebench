Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the opening bidder with no previous bids, I want to start with a conservative yet credible bid. Analyzing my hand '04180453', the digit counts are: 0 (2), 1 (1), 2 (0), 3 (1), 4 (2), 5 (1), 6 (0), 7 (0), 8 (1), 9 (0). The digit '0' appears twice in my hand, so a bid of 2 zeros is safe. However, starting with a bid of 2 might be too cautious. Bidding 3 of a digit I hold at least twice is a reasonable opening. Since I have two 0s and two 4s, a bid of 3 fours is a solid opening bid, as it is likely there is at least one more four in the opponent's hand. This balances assertiveness with safety.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have the digits 2, 6, 9, 8, 7, 1, 3 in my hand, which means I do not have any 4s. Since I cannot contribute to the count of 4s and there are only 16 total cards, it is highly unlikely that there are 3 4s in both players' hands. Therefore, I believe this bid is too high and I will challenge it.
