Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 45275904, so I know I hold two 5s. The current bid is low at 1 0s, which is almost certainly met given that there are 16 digits in play. Rather than challenge a bid that is very likely true, I can safely escalate the bid with a digit I have in abundance. Bidding '2 5s' is valid since 2 is higher than 1, and I am confident about the count given my hand.
