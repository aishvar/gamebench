Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open with an initial bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s and two 0s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. Starting with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I will bid 2 2s to establish a baseline and leave room for future raises.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains one 3. The current bid is 2 3s, which means there must be at least two 3s across both hands. Since I only have one, the opponent likely has at least one or is bluffing. Given that two 3s is quite plausible, challenging now is risky. To increase the bid, the minimal strictly higher bid would be 2 4s. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, so bidding 3 0s would increase the quantity and be supported by my hand, making it a reasonable strategic move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '15220693', I have two 2s, one 1, and two 0s. The current bid is 3 1s. Since I only see one 1, it's somewhat unlikely there are three 1s total, but not implausible. Instead of challenging now, I can comfortably make a higher bid based on my strong count of 2s (two in my hand). A reasonable next bid is 3 2s, which is a higher digit at the same quantity, and plausible given my hand.
