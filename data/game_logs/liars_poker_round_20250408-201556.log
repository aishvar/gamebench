Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 9s, and one each of 3, 8, 7, and 5. A conservative and reasonable opening bid is 2 1s, as I already hold two myself, making it likely true and forcing the opponent to either raise or challenge.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 3, 9, 1, 7, 5, 1, 9. There are no 2s at all, so the current bid of 2 2s depends entirely on the opponent's hand. Since the opponent would need to have both 2s for the bid to be valid, which is possible but not guaranteed, making a minimal higher bid is safer than challenging now. I will increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same by bidding 2 3s, as I have one 3 and it's plausible the opponent has at least one more.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 3, 9, 1, 7, 5, 1, 9. I have zero 4s myself. The current bid is 2 4s, meaning Player 1 is claiming there are at least two 4s across both hands. Given that I have none, all 4s would need to be in Player 1's hand. While it's possible Player 1 has two 4s, it's somewhat unlikely. However, since it's still plausible, instead of challenging now, I will make a minimal higher bid to maintain pressure. The smallest valid raise is keeping the quantity at 2 and increasing the digit to 5. I have one 5, so bidding 2 5s is reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 3, 9, 1, 7, 5, 1, 9. There are no 6s in my hand, so the total number of 6s depends entirely on Player 1's hand. Since the current bid is only 2 6s, it's quite plausible that Player 1 has two 6s, making the bid likely valid. To continue the game without risking an early challenge on a reasonable bid, I should increase the bid slightly. The minimal higher bid would be 2 7s, which is the same quantity but a higher digit. I have one 7, which supports this bid, so I will bid 2 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 3, 9, 1, 7, 5, 1, 9. I see that I have one 8. Since the current bid is 2 8s, it's plausible my opponent has at least one 8, making the current bid reasonable. To raise, I can either increase the digit to 9 (same quantity) or increase the quantity to 3 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s and two 9s, so bidding 3 9s is plausible because I hold two 9s myself, and it's reasonable to assume the opponent might have at least one. Therefore, I will raise to 3 9s.
