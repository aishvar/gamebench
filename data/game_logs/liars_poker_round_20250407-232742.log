Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None. Considering my hand, I have two 4s, one 9, one 5, one 0, and one 1. I can make a reasonable bid by increasing the quantity and digit. I'll choose a digit that I have in my hand and a quantity that's slightly higher than the current maximum possible quantity (16). I'll bid 16 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 16 4s, which claims all 16 digits across both players are 4s. My hand contains zero 4s, making this bid impossible. The opponent would need all 8 of their digits to be 4s, but even then the total would only be 8. Challenging is guaranteed to succeed.
