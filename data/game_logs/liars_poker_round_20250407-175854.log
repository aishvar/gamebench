Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 45064257. I have two 4s and two 5s, making them my most frequent digits. With 16 total digits in play (2 players x 8 digits), the expected count for any digit is 1.6. Since I hold two 5s, the expected total number of 5s across both hands is 2 (mine) + 0.8 (opponent's expected) = 2.8. Bidding '3 Fives' is a strong but plausible opening bid. It leverages my hand's strength in 5s, is statistically likely (needs only one 5 from the opponent), and uses a higher digit (5) than my other strong digit (4), putting more pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 45064257. I have one '6'. The current bid is '3 6s' by Player 1. For this bid to be true, Player 1 must hold at least two '6's (3 total - 1 in my hand = 2 needed from Player 1). While possible, requiring two specific digits from the opponent's 8-digit hand is a reasonable point to consider challenging. However, I have two '4's and two '5's in my hand. My previous bid was '3 5s'. Instead of challenging a relatively low bid, I can make a stronger bid based on my hand. Bidding '4 4s' is a valid next bid. This bid leverages my holding of two '4's and requires Player 1 to have at least two '4's for the bid to be accurate. This puts pressure back on the opponent and is based on the stronger part of my hand, potentially pushing the quantity higher towards a more likely challenge point later.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 45064257. I have two 5s. The current bid is 4 5s, made by Player 1. This bid requires at least two 5s in Player 1's hand (since 4 total 5s are needed, and I have 2). Player 1 has 8 unknown digits. The probability that a randomly chosen digit is a 5 is 0.1. The expected number of 5s in the opponent's hand is 8 * 0.1 = 0.8. The probability of the opponent having 2 or more 5s is relatively low (approximately 1 - P(0 fives) - P(1 five) = 1 - (0.9)^8 - 8*(0.1)*(0.9)^7 â‰ˆ 1 - 0.430 - 0.383 = 0.187). While Player 1's bid of 4 5s (after I bid 3 5s and then switched to 4 4s) might suggest they hold 5s, the statistical likelihood is low. Furthermore, my hand does not support a credible higher bid. Bidding 5 5s would require three 5s from the opponent. Bidding on another digit like 4 6s (I have one 6) or 5 4s (I have two 4s) would require three 6s or three 4s from the opponent, respectively, which are also unlikely. Given the low probability of the current bid being true and the lack of a strong alternative bid based on my hand, challenging is the most strategically sound move.
