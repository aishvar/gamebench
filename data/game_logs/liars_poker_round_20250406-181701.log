Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a mix of digits in my hand, but none are particularly high. The game is starting, and I should aim to make a believable bid to set the tone. Starting with a bid of 3 8s seems reasonable, as it's not too high and I have at least one 8 in my hand.
