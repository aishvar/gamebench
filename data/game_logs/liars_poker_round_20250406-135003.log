Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 3s, two 0s, one 1, and one 2. Starting with a conservative bid based on my two 5s is reasonable, as statistically, there may be at least one more 5 in the opponent's hand. Therefore, I will open with a bid of 3 5s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 07927491, I have two 7s and two 9s, but no 5s or higher digits than 5 in abundance. A reasonable bid seems to be 4 6s or higher, but I don't have any 6s. However, I can see that bidding 4 7s could be a possibility since I have two 7s, increasing the quantity while also increasing the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 55613203, I have no 7s at all. The current bid is 4 7s, which would require all four 7s to be in my opponent's hand. Given there are only 8 digits in their hand, having four 7s is possible but statistically unlikely. Since I have none, and the bid is already at four, challenging here is a strong move because the probability they hold four 7s is low.
