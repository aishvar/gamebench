Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I must start the bidding. Analyzing my hand (21797929), the digit counts are: 1x1, 2x2, 2x7, 2x9, and 1x0/3/4/5/6/8. The most frequent digits are 2, 7, and 9, each appearing twice. A conservative and strategic opening bid typically involves choosing a digit I have multiple of, to increase the likelihood the total count is at least that plus some in the opponent's hand. Therefore, I will open with '2 7', bidding that there are at least two 7's in total, which I already hold myself. This is a safe and reasonable opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 7s'. In my hand (54808068), I do not have any 7s. Therefore, I cannot support the claim that there are at least 2 sevens across both players' hands. Since I have no 7s, I believe the bid is unlikely to be valid. Thus, I will challenge the bid.
