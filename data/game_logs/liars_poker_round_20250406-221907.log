--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s, which is plausible if the other player has at least one more 7. However, I have multiple 9s and 1s in my hand, which could be a stronger position. I can either bid higher on 7s or switch to a digit where I have more cards. Bidding 3 1s seems reasonable as I have three 1s in my hand, increasing the quantity and changing to a digit I'm confident in.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, but the current bid is 3 1s. Since I don't have enough of any digit to make a higher bid, and considering I have no 1s, challenging is a strategic move to test if the bid is a bluff.
