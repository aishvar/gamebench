Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (00247143), I count the occurrences of each digit: 0 appears twice, 2 once, 4 once, 7 once, 1 once, and 3 twice. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the count of digits in my hand and consider the total count across both hands. Since there are 8 digits in my hand and the total count for any digit can be at most 16, a moderate starting bid is sensible. I notice I have two 0s and two 3s. Bidding on a digit I have more than one of seems reasonable. I'll bid on '3 0s' or '3 3s'. Bidding '3 0s' seems a good starting point as it reflects a count slightly above my own hand's count for 0, considering there are 16 digits in total.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '97315319', I have zero 0s. Since the total number of digits is 16, the current bid of 3 0s would require the opponent to hold all 3 zeros. This is somewhat unlikely but still quite plausible, as it's not an extremely high bid for zeros. Instead of challenging now, I can safely make a minimal higher bid to keep the pressure on by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, such as bidding 3 1s. I have two 1s, so needing just one more from the opponent is quite reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. The total count of 1s across both hands must be at least 1 (from my hand) and at most 9 (if the other player has all 8 digits as 1, which is highly unlikely). It's more likely that the total count is around 2-3. Since I have one 1, bidding 3 2s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases the digit and is still within a plausible range.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 2S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 9, 7, 3, 1, 5, 3, 1, 9. I have zero 2s, so the current bid of 3 2s depends entirely on Player 0's hand containing at least three 2s, which is unlikely given the distribution of digits. Since I have no 2s at all, challenging is a strong move here.
