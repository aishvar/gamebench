Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (65912876), I have: one 1, one 2, one 5, two 6s, one 7, one 8, and one 9. Since I have two 6s in my hand, that's a good starting point. The other player likely has 0-2 sixes in their hand, so bidding 3 6s is reasonable. It's a moderate opening bid that's not too aggressive but still leverages my hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which means there are at least two 6s in total. The current bid is 3 6s, which is already higher than the minimum guaranteed count. However, I can increase the quantity to 4, assuming there might be another 6 in Player 0's hand. This is a reasonable bid based on the information available.

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (the fourth digit). The current bid of 4 6s implies there should be at least 4 sixes total between both players. Since I only have 1 six, that means Player 1 would need to have at least 3 sixes in their hand for this bid to be valid. While it's possible they have 3 or more sixes, it seems somewhat unlikely. However, I need to consider that Player 1 raised my original bid of 3 6s to 4 6s, which suggests they might actually have multiple sixes. Given this information and the fact that I only have 1 six, I think challenging is the better option than making a higher bid.
