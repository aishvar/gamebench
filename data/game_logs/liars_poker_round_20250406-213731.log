Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 91416607, which contains two 6s and one 1 and one 9. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. Bidding on 6s seems promising since I have two of them. I'll start with a bid of 2 6s, as it's a conservative start and reflects some of the information I have.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have two 9s in my hand, which allows me to make a higher bid. Bidding 2 9s is a valid move as it increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, making it a higher bid than 2 6s.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have the digits 91416607, which means I have one 9 and various other digits. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have a 6 and a few other relatively high digits, but not many 9s, I can consider bidding on a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Bidding 3 0s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s, and I have no 0s in my hand. Given the previous bids focused on higher digits, it's unlikely there are three 0s across both hands. Challenging this bid seems reasonable to test its validity.
