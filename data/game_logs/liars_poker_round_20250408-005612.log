Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a relatively balanced hand with no obvious high-value digits. Given the current state, a strategic move is to make a bid that sets a baseline for the game. I'll start with a bid of 2 8s, as it's a common digit and a moderate quantity, providing a reasonable starting point for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s (digits are 2, 9, 0, 8, 5, 1, 8, 4). Since the current bid is 2 8s, and I already hold two of them, it's highly probable that there are at least two 8s total. Given that, a challenge would almost certainly fail. The minimal safe raise is to increase the quantity or the digit. The next higher bid could be 3 0s, but since I hold one 0, or 3 8s, which is plausible given my two 8s plus the opponent possibly holding one. So, bidding 3 8s is a reasonable and safe incremental raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. I can safely bid 4 8s, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Player 0 bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '29085184', I have three 8s. The current bid is 4 8s, which would require at least one 8 in Player 0's hand. Since Player 0 confidently raised from 2 to 4 8s, it's plausible they have at least one or two 8s themselves. Given that, the bid seems plausible, but raising further to 5 8s would require at least two more 8s in their hand, which is unlikely as I already hold three. Therefore, challenging now is strategically sound because the likelihood of there being 4 or more 8s is borderline, and 5 or more is very improbable.
