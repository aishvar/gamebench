Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s and two 0s. Starting with a conservative but solid opening bid based on my hand, I will bid 2 8s, reflecting the two 8s I hold. This is a safe opening that doesn't reveal too much but establishes a reasonable baseline.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. Since I have no 8s, the opponent must have at least two 8s. The probability of them having two or more is low (only ~19%), making challenging a favorable risk.
