Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 50921377, I have two 7s. Since this is the first bid and I want to start conservatively but with some confidence based on what I know, bidding 3 7s is reasonable. This suggests there's at least one more 7 between both hands, which is plausible given there are 8 unknown digits in the opponent's hand.
