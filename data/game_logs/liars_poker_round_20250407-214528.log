Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first turn and there are no bids yet. My hand contains the digits 3, 1, 8, 4, 9, 0, 0, 8. Counting the digits, I have two 0's, two 8's, and one of each 1, 3, 4, and 9. The optimal opening bid usually targets a digit I have multiple copies of, maximizing the likelihood that the total count is at least as high as my bid. Since I have two 0's and two 8's, I can safely start with a conservative opening bid of 2 zeros, which is a standard safe opening bid and forces the opponent to either raise or challenge with little information.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (52667167), I see I have 3 '6's, 2 '7's, and 1 each of '5', '2', and '1', and no '0's. The current bid is '2 0s'. Since I don't have any '0's, I need to either bid a digit that I have in my hand or challenge if I think the bid is too high. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and there are only 8 digits per player, bidding a higher quantity of a digit I have or a higher digit with a reasonable quantity seems strategic. However, without information on Player 0's full hand, I must make an educated guess. I see an opportunity to bid on '2's since I have one '2'. If Player 0 only had 2 '0's as they claimed, my bid could potentially be safe if I have enough of another digit to make a higher claim.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or challenge. My hand contains 3 zeros (0 appears three times in 52667167, specifically not but 3 times). To make a valid bid, I must exceed the current quantity of 2 for the digit 0 or bid a higher digit with any quantity. Since my hand has 3 zeros, I can bid higher than 2 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (31849008), I have the digits: 3, 1, 8, 4, 9, 0, 0, 8. Counting zeros, I see 2 zeros. The current bid is 3 zeros across both hands. Since I have 2 zeros myself, Player 1 would only need to have at least 1 zero among their 8 digits for the bid to be valid. Given the probability — zeros appear roughly 1/10th of the time — it's quite likely Player 1 has at least one zero. Therefore, challenging now is risky. A safe move is to increase the bid slightly. The next minimal valid bid is '3 1s' (since the digit is higher), but I only see one '1' in my hand, making that uncertain. Alternatively, I can increase the count to 4 zeros. Since I have 2 zeros, Player 1 would need at least 2 zeros, which is less probable but still plausible. Given the uncertainty, bidding '4 0s' pressures Player 1 and avoids a risky challenge.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing the current bid of '4 0s', I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is the best option. The current bid is 4 zeros. I have 8 secret digits in my hand: 52667167. Counting the zeros in my hand, I find 2 zeros. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and there are 2 players, I must consider if bidding higher or challenging is strategic. Since I have 2 zeros, if Player 0 has 2 or fewer zeros, the current bid of '4 0s' could be valid or even beatable. However, without exact information on Player 0's hand, I must make an educated guess. I can increase the quantity or the digit. A safe bet would be to increase the digit since I don't have information about other digits in Player 0's hand. I see an opportunity to bid on a higher digit that could potentially be more common.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (52667167), I count 3 zeros. The current bid is '4 0s'. To make a valid higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have 3 zeros, I can confidently bid higher on zeros or switch to a higher digit if I have it. My hand contains 1 ones, 1 twos, 1 fives, 2 sixes, and 1 sevens, and no higher digits than 7. Given that bidding '4 1s' or higher quantity of existing digits might not be optimal without knowing the opponent's hand, I choose to bid on a digit I have, increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (31849008), I have three zeros (the '0' in positions 4, 7, and 8). The current bid is 5 zeros across both hands. Given that I hold 3 zeros, Player 1 would need at least 2 zeros in their hand to make the bid valid. Since the average distribution of zeros in 8 random digits is roughly 0.8 (about 8% chance per digit), expecting 2 or more zeros in their hand is plausible but not guaranteed. However, given the prior incremental bidding and the fact that I hold 3 zeros, it's somewhat risky to challenge now; Player 1 could very well have 2 or more zeros. To stay in the game strategically, a safe approach is to increase the bid by quantity or digit. The minimal valid raise is '5 1s', which is a higher digit with the same quantity, or '6 0s'. I will conservatively bid '5 1s' to keep options open and avoid overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing the current bid of '5 1s' made by Player 0, I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is the best option. The current bid is 5 of the digit 1. I will count the number of 1s in my hand: I have 1 '1' in my hand (52667167). The maximum possible quantity for any digit across both hands is 16. Given that I only have 1 '1', bidding a higher quantity of '1's is not possible for me. However, I can bid on a different digit. Counting my digits: I have 1 '0', 0 '1's, 1 '2', 1 '3', 0 '4's, 2 '5's, 2 '6's, and 1 '7'. Since the current bid is on '1's and I only have 1 '1', I should consider bidding on a digit that I have a higher count of. I have 2 '5's, 2 '6's, and 1 '7', and 1 '0', 1 '2', 1 '3' and 1 '7'. I can bid on '5's or '6's as they are higher than '1'. I choose to bid on '5's because I have 2 of them, which is a higher quantity than '1's. Thus, I will bid '6 5s' as it's higher than '5 1s'.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 fives. Looking at my hand (31849008), I have zero 5s. Since I have none, for the bid to be true, the opponent must have all 6 or more 5s in their 8-digit hand, which is extremely unlikely. Given the maximum total digits is 16, and I hold zero 5s, the probability that there are at least 6 fives overall is very low. Therefore, challenging is the best move here rather than making a higher, riskier bid.
