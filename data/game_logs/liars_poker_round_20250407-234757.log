Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The opponent bid 3 0s, requiring at least two more 0s in their hand. Given the low probability of the opponent holding two or more 0s (approximately 18.7% based on binomial distribution), challenging the bid has an 81.3% chance of success. This high likelihood of the bid being false makes challenging the optimal move.
