--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 4s, one 1, one 2, one 6, and one 8. A safe opening bid is 2 3s or 2 4s, reflecting my own hand, as it's statistically likely that there are at least two of these digits across both hands, and possibly more. I'll open with 2 4s to start conservatively but credibly.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 4s in my hand. With 8 unknown digits from the opponent, the probability of them having â‰¥2 4s is low (~18.7%). Challenging has a high success chance (81.3%) as they'd need exactly 2+ 4s in their hand to validate the bid, which is statistically unlikely.
