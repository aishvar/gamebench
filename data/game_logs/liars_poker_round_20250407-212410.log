Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits 7, 5, 2, 6, 3, 5, 0, and 8. The digit '5' appears twice, which is the highest count of any digit in my hand. A safe and strategic opening bid is to declare '2 5s', as it's likely that at least one '5' appears in the opponent's hand as well, making the total count at least 2 or more. This bid is reasonable and sets a solid foundation for the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and the opponent has bid 2 5s, it is likely that they do not have many 5s either. Given the uncertainty and the low current bid, challenging seems risky. Instead, I will make a conservative bid on a digit I know I have, which is 1. Bidding 'Q D' (10 1s) is a reasonable next step as it is a higher bid and covers a digit I am certain of having.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. It's unlikely that the other player has 2 5s. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
