Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no zeros. Since the current bid is only 1 zero, and I hold none, there are still 8 unknown digits in Player 0's hand. It is quite plausible they have at least 1 zero, so challenging now is risky. A minimal safe raise is to increase the digit with the same quantity. I hold two 9s, so bidding 1 9s is guaranteed true from my own hand, and it strictly beats the current bid by digit. This is a safe minimal raise.
