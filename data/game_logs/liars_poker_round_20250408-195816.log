Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I looked at my hand '13099015' and noticed I have two 9s. Since there’s no current bid, I can safely begin by bidding an outcome that I know is guaranteed by my hand. Bidding '2 9s' is solid because if challenged, I can reveal my two 9s, and since 9 is the highest digit, the opponent can’t match a same-quantity bid with a higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. Given my hand, I can see that I have a 9, which is a good starting point. I should make a bid with a higher quantity or digit to increase my chances of winning. Since I have a 9, I can safely bid 3 9s, increasing the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid of 3 9s would be valid only if my opponent has at least one 9 among their eight digits — a probability of roughly 57%. If I raise the bid to 4 of any digit, I’d need my opponent to supply at least two of that digit (since I hold at most two of the promising ones), which is only about an 18% chance. Given that challenging the current bid would have me win if my opponent has no 9s (about a 43% chance), challenging now is relatively more attractive than bidding an even less likely amount.
