Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Starting with a bid of two 6s is safe because even if challenged, the total count is at least two. This sets a reasonable opening bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have two 4s and two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 4s is a reasonable move as it increases the quantity and the digit is plausible given my hand.

Player 1 bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 4s in my hand. The opponent bid 3 4s, requiring them to hold all three 4s themselves. Given the low probability of a single player holding three of one digit in an 8-card hand, and the strategic risk of escalating the bid with uncertain information, challenging is the optimal move.
