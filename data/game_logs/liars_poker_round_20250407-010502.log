Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand (92019271), I have: one 9, one 2, two 1s, one 0, one 7. Since I have two 1s in my hand, I know there are at least 2 ones in the game. The other player likely has some 1s as well. A conservative first bid would be to claim there are 3 1s total, which is reasonable given I already have 2 myself. This is a safe opening bid that's likely to be true while not revealing too much about my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I don't have any 1s in my hand. I can bid 4 2s, increasing the quantity and using a digit I have in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '4 2s'. Looking at my hand (92019271), I have only one 2, so there would need to be at least three more 2s in my opponent's hand for their bid to be valid. While this is possible, it's somewhat unlikely that they would have such a concentration of 2s. However, I do have three 1s in my hand, which gives me confidence in bidding on 1s. I could bid '5 1s' which would be higher than '4 2s' because of the increased quantity. This is reasonable since I already have three 1s, so I only need my opponent to have two more 1s for this to be valid. I'll make this bid rather than challenging, as it's a safer move at this stage of the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. The maximum possible number of 1s is 16. It is plausible that there are at least five 1s. I will bid higher to try to force the other player to challenge. I will bid 6 2s, since the digit must be higher than 1, and I have a 2 in my hand.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have 8 digits in my hand (92019271), which contains two 1s, one 2, one 0, one 9, two 7s, and one 9. The current bid is '6 2s', meaning Player 1 believes there are at least 6 twos between both our hands. I only have one 2 in my hand, which means Player 1 would need to have at least 5 twos in their hand for this bid to be valid. While possible, it seems unlikely that they would have that many 2s. Given the previous bidding pattern where they've been pushing the quantity of 2s, I think they're bluffing. I'll challenge this bid rather than making a higher one that would be even riskier.
