Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (31083198), I have two 1s, two 3s, and two 8s. With no current bid, I want to start gently with a bid that I can comfortably back up from my known digits. Bidding '2 1s' is appealing since I already hold two 1s and statistically, it's likely that the opponent's hand might add at least one more 1, making the bid plausible.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 95757442, I have a total of 3 '1's, 1 '2', 1 '4', 1 '5', 1 '7', 1 '9'. I also notice that the current bid is quite low, so I should consider the possibility of having a higher quantity or digit. Given that I have no '1's in my hand, I should focus on a higher digit. I see that I have three '7's and other digits are not as frequent. A reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity or the digit. I have three '7's, so bidding 3 7s seems reasonable.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand (31083198). Given that I hold zero 7s, the only possible 7s come from the opponent's 8 unknown digits. The probability that the opponent has at least 3 7s is extremely low (around 4%), making the current bid of 3 7s highly unlikely. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
