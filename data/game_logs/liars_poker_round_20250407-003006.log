--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (67881806), I see that I have two 8s, which is a strong starting point. Bidding 2 8s is a safe and reasonable first bid, as it is likely to be valid and sets a baseline for the game.

Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 70949503, I have zero 8s. Since the current bid is only 2 8s, and I hold none, the probability that the opponent has both 8s is plausible but not guaranteed. Given 16 digits total and no 8s on my side, it's somewhat risky to challenge now. A safe move is to raise the bid slightly with a digit I have more of. I have two 9s, so bidding 3 9s is reasonable and strictly higher than 2 8s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 9s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total, it's unlikely that Player 1 has 3 9s. I should challenge the bid instead of making a higher bid that I cannot support.
