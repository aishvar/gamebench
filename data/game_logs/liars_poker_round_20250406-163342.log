Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 7s, the highest frequency in my hand. Bidding 2 7s is safe because even if the opponent has zero 7s, the total count (2) matches the bid, making a challenge unwinnable. This establishes a credible opening bid based on my strongest digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 59672841, I have one 7. Given there are 16 digits in total and the current bid is 2 7s, it's quite plausible there are at least two 7s overall. Challenging now would likely lose. To make a higher bid, I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Since I also have one 8, bidding 2 8s is a safe incremental bid that is strictly higher and supported by my hand.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s. Since 3 is a higher quantity than 2, bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid. My existing two 7s mean the opponent only needs one more 7 to make this bid truthful, which is reasonably probable given the remaining digits.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 59672841, I have one 7 and one 8. The current bid is 3 7s. Since I only have one 7, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least two 7s, which is plausible but not guaranteed. Alternatively, I can raise the bid slightly to maintain pressure. Because I also have one 8 and already previously bid on 8s, and 8s are often less common, increasing the bid to 3 8s (same quantity, higher digit) is a safe incremental raise that keeps options open without overcommitting.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 1 8 in my hand. The opponent bid 3 8s, requiring at least 2 more from their hand. Given the bid history and their focus on 8s, they might have exactly 2, making the total 3. However, there's a chance they're bluffing with fewer. Challenging risks losing if they have 2+ 8s, but I'll take that gamble given the uncertainty.
