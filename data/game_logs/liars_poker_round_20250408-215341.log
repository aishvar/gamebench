Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Since this is the first bid, I choose a moderate quantity to encourage potential challenges. Bidding 3 3s is a reasonable starting point, assuming the opponent might have at least one 3.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I only hold one 3, making 3 total 3s unlikely unless the opponent holds 2 or more. However, I have two 5s, so I only need the opponent to hold at least one 5 for there to be 3 in total. That is more likely than 3 3s, so I will raise the bid to 3 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have zero 5s in my hand, making it difficult to assess the likelihood of the bid. Given the previous bid of 3 3s and the current bid of 3 5s, challenging the bid seems like a strategic move to reveal the actual count of 5s.
