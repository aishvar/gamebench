Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid, I can start with a small, relatively safe bid. I have three 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s seems like a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 7s, I can make a bid with a higher quantity, like 4 7s, or with the same quantity but a higher digit, like 3 8s. However, I don't have any 8s in my hand, so I should make a bid with a higher quantity, like 4 7s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have three 7s in my hand. It's possible there are at least six 7s in total, but it's also possible the other player is bluffing. Since I have a good number of 7s, I will raise the bid to 7 7s to see if they challenge or raise further.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 7 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s, and I have two 7s in my hand. I should increase the digit to 8, as I have one 8 in my hand, making it a reasonable bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 7 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. It's possible there are at least seven 8s in the game, but it seems somewhat unlikely. I could bid 8 0s, but challenging has a decent chance of success. Given the bid history on 7s, and now a jump to 8s, there's a reasonable chance my opponent is bluffing.
