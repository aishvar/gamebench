Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a varied hand (digits: 6, 3, 0, 8, 1, 4, 1, 7). Digit '1' appears twice, making it my strongest digit. With no bids yet, it's safe and strategic to open conservatively. I'll bid 3 1s, assuming my opponent likely has at least one additional '1'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (97853952), I don't have any 1s. The opponent bid 3 1s, which means they're claiming there are at least 3 ones between our hands. Since I have zero 1s, they would need to have at least 3 ones in their hand alone. While possible, this seems unlikely. Given this is the first bid and they chose a relatively low quantity, they might be bluffing. I should challenge.
