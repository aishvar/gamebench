Player 0 Reasoning: I have the digits 9, 0, 6, 8, 6, 7, 5, and 3, with digit '6' appearing twice. Since there are no bids yet, starting conservatively by bidding on a digit I already have multiple copies of is safe. I'll bid '3 6s' as it's likely the opponent has at least one more 6.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. Bidding 4 6s would be risky without knowing the opponent's hand. I have two 8s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid bid (same quantity, higher digit) and doesn't reveal too much about my hand. It's a conservative but reasonable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one '8' in my hand. Player 1 bid '3 8s', meaning they likely have at least one or two 8s themselves. Considering there are 16 digits total, it's plausible there could be at least three 8s. However, since I already bid '3 6s' and have two 6s in my hand, I feel more confident increasing the quantity of 6s to 4, as I have a stronger basis for this digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. The previous bid was 3 8s, and I have two 8s. Bidding 4 8s would be a reasonable increase. However, given that the opponent just bid up to 4 6s after previously bidding 3 8s, they likely have some 6s. Bidding 5 6s feels risky, and 4 7s or higher is unlikely given my hand. Therefore, challenging the 4 6s bid seems like the best course of action, as it's unlikely there are four 6s given my hand and the opponent's previous bids.
