Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I must start the bidding. Analyzing my hand, I observe the digit counts: 7(1), 6(1), 1(1), 9(1), 5(1), 2(1), 3(1), 8(1). All digits appear exactly once. The most common initial bid is typically 2 of a mid-value digit or 1 of a high digit. Given I have one '9' and it's a strong digit, a safe and strategic opening bid is 2 nines, implying I believe there are at least two 9s total. This is conservative yet credible, forcing the opponent to either raise cautiously or challenge prematurely.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 9s'. I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or challenge. My hand contains one '9'. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and there are 2 players, if Player 0 has 2 '9s' as claimed, then I must have a higher quantity or digit to bid. Since I only have 1 '9', I can try to bid on a digit that is more likely to have a higher count or challenge if I think 2 '9s' is unlikely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains one 9. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and there are 2 players, I can potentially make a higher bid. However, without knowing Player 0's exact hand, I must consider the possibility that they also have a high count of 9s. Since I only have one 9, bidding a higher quantity of 9s might be risky. I should consider bidding a different digit that I have multiple of or challenge if I think 2 9s is unlikely.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 fives. Looking at my hand (76195238), I have zero fives. For the bid to be true, the opponent would need to hold all 3 or more fives in their hand, which is statistically unlikely given only 8 digits. Since I have none, the chance that there are 3 or more fives total is low. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move rather than increasing the bid.
