Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to set a bid that's hard to challenge. I have one 9 in my hand, so bidding 1 9s is safe because the challenger would lose if they call it (since the total is at least 1). This forces the opponent to either raise the quantity to 2 9s or higher, but cannot challenge immediately.

Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 1 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9, which aligns with the current bid of 1 9s. Since it's quite likely that at least one 9 exists in the opponent's hand or none at all, challenging now would be risky. A minimal safe raise is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I don't have any 9s beyond my one, but I do have two 0s, so bidding 1 0s is not valid as it's not higher. The next valid bid is 2 9s or 1 of a higher digit, like 1 9s -> 2 0s, but 2 0s is a valid increase and supported by my hand. Since I have two 0s, I will bid 2 0s to increase the quantity safely.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 9 in my hand, bidding 2 9s raises the digit to 9, which is higher than 0 while keeping the same quantity. This is a strategic move to shift focus to a higher digit, leveraging my existing 9.

Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9 and two 0s. The current bid is 2 9s. Since I hold one 9, the opponent would need to have at least one or two 9s for the bid to be valid. It is quite plausible that the opponent has at least one 9, so challenging now may be risky. Instead, I can safely increase the bid by quantity, leveraging my two 0s, and bid 3 0s, which is a strictly higher bid than 2 9s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. My hand contains 1 zero. The opponent's hand has 8 unknown digits. The probability that they have at least 2 zeros (to reach a total of 3) is low (~18.8%). Challenging offers a high chance of winning since there's an 81.2% probability the total zeros are less than 3.
