Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make a valid initial bid. I have two 6s in my hand, which allows me to confidently bid at least 2 6s. However, since I want to start strong and potentially intimidate my opponent, I will bid 3 6s, which is a reasonable amount given the total of 16 digits in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have only one 6 in my hand, and the current bid of 3 6s means that the opponent must have at least 2 additional 6s in their 8 digitsâ€”a probability of roughly 18.7%. Given that it's very unlikely for the opponent to hold that many 6s, challenging the bid seems the best move.
