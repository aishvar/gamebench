Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 52480517. I can count that I have one 0, one 1, two 5s, one 2, one 4, one 7, and one 8. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. I have two 5s, which is the highest count of any digit in my hand. Bidding 2 5s seems like a safe and reasonable start.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 5s, making it unlikely that the total number of 5s is significantly higher than 2. However, since the current bid is only 2 5s, it's quite plausible that there are two 5s across both hands. Challenging now would be risky. To increase the bid, I can consider the digits I have multiple copies of. I have two 2s and two 3s. To safely raise, I can bid 3 2s, increasing the quantity and using a digit I have two of, making the bid reasonable based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 2S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have one 2 in my hand (52480517), so the total count of 2s is at least 1 (from my hand) plus the count from the other player's hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. I see that I have a 5 and an 8, but bidding on 5s or 8s directly might not be the best as I don't know the other player's hand. However, I can bid on a higher digit than 2. Since I have one 2, there's a possibility the other player has at least two 2s, making the bid plausible. I will increase the digit to make a higher bid. Bidding 3 3s seems like a reasonable next step as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 3S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 7, 2, 5, 9, 1, 8, 3, 2. Counting the 3s, I only have one. Since the current bid is 3 3s, this would require the opponent to have at least two 3s, which is somewhat unlikely but possible. Alternatively, I have two 2s, and the previous bid on 2s was 3 2s, so bidding 4 2s would be a reasonable increase. Given my two 2s, it's plausible that the opponent has at least two more 2s, making a bid of 4 2s credible and safer than challenging now.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 2S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have one 2 in my hand (52480517), so it's possible that the total count of 2s is 4 or more across both hands. However, given that I have a total of 3 twos and fives (2, 5) in my hand and the previous bid was 3 3s, it seems reasonable to increase the bid slightly. I can bid 4 3s, which is a higher digit than 2s but the same quantity, making it a valid bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 72591832, I have two 3s. The current bid is 4 3s, meaning there must be at least two more 3s in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. Since each player has 8 digits, it's plausible but somewhat unlikely that the opponent has at least two 3s. Given that, a challenge is reasonable because the probability of four or more total 3s is not high enough to confidently support the bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bid of 4 3s.
