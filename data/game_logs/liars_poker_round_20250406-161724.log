--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 34782917, I observe one 3, one 4, one 7, one 8, two 9s, one 2, and one 1. A conservative opening bid is often 2 of a common digit in my hand. I have two 9s, so bidding 2 9s is a reasonable start based on my hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s, which is relatively low, but since I don't have any 9s, it's possible the other player has at least two. To stay safe, I'll make a slightly higher bid on a digit I have more of, like 6s, where I have two in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 34782917, I have zero 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, which requires at least three 6s across both hands. Since I have none, all 3+ must be in my opponent's hand. With only 8 digits, it's unlikely my opponent has 3 or more 6s. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
