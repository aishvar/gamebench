Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 84108866, I notice that I have multiple occurrences of the digit 8. Since the goal is to make a bid that is likely to be true but also strategic, bidding on a digit I have multiple of seems wise. I have three 8s in my hand, so bidding on 4 8s seems like a balanced start, considering the total possible count of any digit across both players' hands could be up to 16.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 91453034, I have zero 8s. Since I hold half the digits and none are 8s, the opponent would need to have all 4 or more 8s in their hand to make the bid of 4 8s valid. Given the distribution, this is quite unlikely, as having 4 or more of a single digit in 8 digits is rare. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
