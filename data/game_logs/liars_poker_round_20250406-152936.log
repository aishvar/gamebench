--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 4, two 7s, one 8, two 1s, one 3, and one 9. The most frequent digits in my hand are 7s and 1s, each appearing twice. A safe opening bid would be 2 7s, reflecting my own hand and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (from 02632516). The total count of 7s must be at least 2 (the ones I see), so the bid of 2 7s is plausible. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I see that I have a 6, so bidding 2 8s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 84749731, I have one 8. The current bid is 2 8s, which is plausible since I have one and the opponent might have one as well. It's risky to challenge now. To escalate logically, I can bid 2 9s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). I have one 9 in my hand, so 2 9s is a reasonable next step.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 9S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (since my hand is 02632516), so there is at least one 9 in my hand. The total count of 9s across both hands must be at least one. Given that the current bid is 2 9s, it's possible but not certain. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. Since the digit is already 9, I can only increase the quantity. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 4, 7, 4, 9, 7, 3, 1. This includes only one 9. The current bid is 3 9s, which means there must be at least three 9s between both hands. Since I only have one 9, the opponent would need to have at least two 9s for the bid to be valid. The probability of the opponent having two or more 9s in their 8 digits is relatively low. Given this, challenging the bid is a strong move.
