Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid and I have to make the first move, I'll analyze my hand: 88342297. I see two 8s, two 2s, and one each of 3, 4, 7, and 9. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and considering the total count across both players. I have 8 digits, so on average, the other player should also have around 8 digits. My hand has a total of 2 eights. Assuming the other player might have at least one 8, bidding '4 8s' seems like a reasonable starting point as it slightly overestimates the likely total count of 8s across both hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, so there is only one confirmed 8. The current bid of 4 8s requires that the opponent must have at least three 8s in their eight-digit handâ€”a situation with roughly a 3-4% chance of occurring. Given this very low probability, the bid seems too high, and I should challenge.
