Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I must start the bidding. My hand contains the digits 8, 2, 1, 5, 8, 0, 6, and 7. The digit '8' appears twice in my hand, which is relatively strong. A reasonable opening bid would be '2 8' (indicating at least 2 eights across all hands), as it leverages the strength of my hand while leaving room for strategic adjustments in future bids.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. Looking at my hand (67303159), I do not have any 8s. For the bid to be valid, the total number of 8s across both hands must be at least 2. Since I have zero, the entire count depends on Player 0's hand. It is somewhat unlikely they hold both 8s, though not impossible. Given the odds—since there are 8 digits in their hand, and the probability of having two or more 8s without me holding any is relatively low—I believe challenging here is the best move rather than risking a higher bid without any 8s myself.
