Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without worrying about being too high. I have two 6s and two 4s in my hand. A bid of '2 4s' or '2 6s' seems reasonable and not easily challengeable given the current state.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 3 6s seems a reasonable increase in quantity based on my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have a 6 in my hand, and I know there are 16 digits in total. Given that Player 1 has already bid 3 6s and I have one 6, I should consider if I can make a valid higher bid. Since my goal is to make a higher bid than 3 6s, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. I have one 6, so if I bid 4 6s, I'm claiming there are at least 4 sixes in total, which seems plausible given that there are 16 digits in play and I already know of one 6. However, I should also consider if there's a higher digit I could bid on that has a better chance of being valid or harder to challenge.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. I can improve the quantity and digit, so I'll bid 5 6s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, and the bid history shows an increase in the quantity of 6s. Given that I have two 6s and the bid is on 6s, I should consider if I can reasonably increase the bid. Since the last bid was also on 6s and I have two of them, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I have a 7, which is higher than 6, but I don't have enough information about other digits in my hand or the opponent's hand. However, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable if I consider my available digits and the goal to make a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 8 6s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 8 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid can be beaten. My hand contains one 6, so I know there are at least 9 sixes in total (8 from the bid + 1 from my hand). I should consider if bidding higher on 6s is possible or if I should switch to a different digit. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should look for a digit that I have multiple instances of and bid higher than 8 if possible.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 9 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 6s. Since I have a 0 and a 3 in my hand, I can safely bid 4 8s. This increases the digit value and seems like a reasonable bet.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 6s. I have a 6 in my hand. I can increase the quantity to 10, as it's a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 10 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 6s. Given that I have a 6 in my hand and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I should consider if I can reasonably make a higher bid or challenge. Since the bid history has been steadily increasing for the digit 6 and I have one 6 in my hand, I should assess if I can make a valid higher bid. The current bid is 10 6s, so I need to bid higher than 10 or have a higher digit with the same or higher quantity. I have a 6 in my hand, and bidding a higher quantity or digit seems feasible.
