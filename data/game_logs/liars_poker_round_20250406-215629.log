Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. I could bid 3 0s, which is a safe increase in quantity and a reset to a low digit. However, I think it's more likely that there are at least two 7s in total, given the previous player bid that. Therefore, I will challenge.
