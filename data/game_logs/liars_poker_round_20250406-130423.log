Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 64735308. I count 3 occurrences of the digit 3. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but not too low. Bidding 3 3s seems like a good starting point as it reflects the count of one of the digits in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. Bidding 4 3s would be a valid and relatively conservative bid. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 9. I have two 9s. Bidding 4 9s is also a possibility, and increases the digit significantly. Since I only have one 3, and the other players could have multiple, I'll choose to bid on the 9s, as it's less likely someone else has as many. Bidding 4 9s seems reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand. The current bid is 4 9s, meaning there would need to be at least 4 9s across all players' hands. With only 24 digits in total and the bid already at 4, it's unlikely that there are that many 9s. Challenging seems like the best move.
