Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening bid and there is no current bid, I want to start with a conservative yet plausible bid based on my hand. I have one 6, one 0, one 9, two 2s, one 5, one 1, and one 8. The digit '2' appears twice in my hand, making it a strong candidate for an opening bid. A reasonable starting bid is 2 2s, reflecting my hand and leaving room to escalate.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have one 2 in my hand, so the total count of 2s is at least 1. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have much information about the other player's hand, I'll play it safe and increase the digit. Bidding 2 3s is a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 60926518, I have no 3s, so the current bid of 2 3s relies entirely on Player 1's hand. Since there are 16 digits total, having at least 2 of any digit is quite plausible, so challenging now is risky. To outbid, I can either bid 2 4s or increase the quantity. I have two 6s, so bidding 3 6s is reasonable, as it only requires one more 6 in Player 1's hand, which is likely. This raises both the quantity and digit significantly, presenting a stronger bid based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have one 6, it's possible there are at least three 6s in total. However, bidding more than 4 6s might be too aggressive. I can bid 4 6s, increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I can bid 3 7s, keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit. Given that I don't have any 7s, bidding 3 7s is risky. Bidding 4 6s seems like a reasonable move as it is a relatively safe increase in quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s. The current bid is 4 6s, which means there must be at least two more 6s in the opponent's hand to make the bid valid. Given the average distribution (each digit appearing roughly 1.6 times per hand) and the fact that I already hold two 6s, it's unlikely the opponent has two or more additional 6s. Therefore, the bid of 4 6s is quite aggressive and probably an overbid. The probability favors challenging at this point.
