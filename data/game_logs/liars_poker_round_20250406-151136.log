Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 9s, two 1s, one 0, and one 7. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be 2 9s, leveraging my strong count of 9s to set a solid baseline.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (since my hand is 65673895), making the total count of 9s at least 1. The maximum possible count for any digit is 16, and there are 8 digits per player. Given that I see one 9, it's possible that the other player has more than one 9. However, bidding higher than 2 9s requires a quantity greater than 2 or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, I must increase the quantity. Bidding 3 0s is a valid higher bid. I'll choose to bid 3 0s because it's a relatively safe increase in quantity and I have some information about my own hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 89110879, I have two 0s. The current bid is 3 0s, which means my opponent claims there are at least three 0s total. Since I hold two, for the bid to be valid, my opponent must have at least one 0. This is plausible. Instead of challenging now, I can safely increase the bid by either raising the quantity or increasing the digit with the same quantity. I have three 1s in my hand, so bidding 3 1s is a strictly higher bid with a higher digit, and it is supported by my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 1S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. My hand is 65673895, which contains no 1s. I need to make a higher bid. I can see that I have a 6 and other digits, but no 1s. The next higher bid could be either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I don't have any 1s, 2s, or 3s, I can bid on a higher digit. I can bid 3 5s or higher. However, I should not overbid. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it is a higher digit and I have a 6 in my hand, making it somewhat plausible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 9, 1, 1, 0, 8, 7, 9. I have zero 6s myself. The current bid is 3 6s, which means my opponent is claiming at least three 6s across both hands. Since I have none, all three would have to be in their hand, which is somewhat unlikely but not impossible. However, since it's still early in the bidding and there is room to increase with digits I hold, a safer move is to raise the bid to a digit I have strong presence of. I have two 1s, and previously bid 3 1s, so increasing to 4 1s is a reasonable and safer bid than calling or guessing on 6s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. My hand contains the digits 65673895, and I can see that I have no 1s. The bid of 4 1s implies that there are at least four 1s across both hands. Given that I have none, Player 0 must have at least four 1s, which is possible but seems high. However, I can try to bid higher or challenge. I have a total of one 6 and no other high digits except for one 9 and one 8 and one 7 and one 5. I can try to bid on a digit that I have, like 6s or 8s or 9s, to make a higher bid. Since I have one 6, and the current bid is 4 1s, I can bid 4 6s or higher. Bidding 5 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (89110879), I have zero 6s. The current bid is 5 6s, which implies at least five 6s across both hands. Since I have none, all five would need to be in Player 1's hand. Given there are only 8 digits in Player 1's hand, having five or more 6s is statistically unlikely. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 1's (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bid of 5 6s.
