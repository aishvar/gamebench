Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I can make an initial bid. I have two 0s and two 4s in my hand. I will bid 2 4s to start.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 4s, but I do have two 5s. Since the current bid is 2 4s, a strictly higher valid bid would be 2 5s, which increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This is a safe and reasonable bid given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. I could challenge, but it's early in the game, and there's a reasonable chance there are at least two 5s. I will make a slightly higher bid. I have two 4s, and the previous bid was 2 4s, so I will bid 3 4s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 55983621, I have two 5s and no 4s. The current bid is 3 4s. Since I have zero 4s, there would need to be at least 3 among Player 0's eight digits, which is somewhat unlikely. However, since I have two 5s, a safe and strictly higher bid would be 3 5s (same quantity, higher digit). This is a reasonable conservative raise based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I don't have any 5s in my hand. To make a safe bid, I should increase the quantity to 4 and choose a digit I have, like 4. Therefore, I will bid 4 4s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 4S'
Player 0 bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (55983621), I have zero 4s. The current bid is 4 4s, which would require my opponent to have at least all four 4s or a combination of some in both hands. Since I have none, all 4s must be in their hand, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. Statistically, having four of the same digit in one hand is rare. Therefore, the bid of 4 4s seems improbable, and challenging is the best move.
