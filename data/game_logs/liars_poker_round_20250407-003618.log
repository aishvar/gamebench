Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s. Bidding 2 1s is a safe starting point, as it's likely to be true given the distribution of digits in a typical hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. Bidding 3 1s would be risky as it relies entirely on my opponent having at least two 1s. I have two 0s, two 9s, one 4, one 6, and one 8. Bidding 3 0s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity while choosing a digit I have. Alternatively, I could bid 2 2s, but that doesn't leverage my existing cards as well. Therefore, I will bid 3 0s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 0s. Since there are only 16 digits in total, it's unlikely there are 3 or more 0s. I should challenge this bid.
