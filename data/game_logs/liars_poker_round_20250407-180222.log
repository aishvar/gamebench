Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: For my opening bid, I should analyze my own hand first. I have: 29017016. Looking at the frequencies: two 0s, two 1s, one each of 2,6,7,9. Since I have two 0s and two 1s, those are good candidates for an opening bid. The opponent has 8 digits as well, so any digit could appear up to 8 more times. A conservative opening bid would be to bid 3 of something I have at least 2 of. I'll bid 3 ones (1s) since I have 2 in my hand, making it reasonable that there could be at least 1 more in the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. My hand is 33749065, which contains zero 1s. For the current bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least three 1s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, challenging this early feels risky without more information. I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding '3 3s' is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid is statistically strong, as it only requires the opponent to have one 3 among their 8 digits for the bid to be true, which is highly probable. This is a safer move than challenging and shifts the pressure back to Player 0.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 29017016, I have zero 3s. The opponent bid '3 3s', meaning they claim there are at least 3 threes between both hands. Since I have none, all 3 would need to be in their hand. While possible, I need to consider if raising is better. To raise, I'd need to bid either more 3s (which is risky since I have none) or bid a higher digit with at least 3 quantity. Looking at my hand, I see I have two 0s and one 1, which isn't enough for a confident higher bid. Given I have no 3s and the opponent would need all 3 claimed threes in their hand, challenging seems like the safer play.
