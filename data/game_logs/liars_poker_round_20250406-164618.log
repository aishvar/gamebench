Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a good chance of having digits 2, 3, and 8 in my hand, with at least one 2 and one 3. Given the current bid is None, I should start with a reasonable bid, focusing on the digit 2, which seems to be the safest choice.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 9, 8, 0, 4, 6, 4, 2, 5. I have one 2. The current bid is 2 2s, which requires at least two 2s across both hands. Since I have one, it's quite plausible that the opponent has at least one more 2, making the bid reasonable. Therefore, challenging now is risky. To raise, I can either increase the quantity to 3 of any digit or bid 2 of a higher digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, so bidding 3 4s is a reasonable next bid, assuming the opponent might have one 4.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 4S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have a 4 in my hand. Bidding 3 4s seems reasonable, but I'll increase the digit to 5. I also have a 5 in my hand, so this bid seems plausible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (98046425), I have one 5. The current bid is 3 5s, so there must be at least two more 5s in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. Since the probability of the opponent having two or more 5s is moderate but not guaranteed, it's safer to raise the bid slightly rather than challenge now. I also have two 4s, and since the current bid is 3 5s, I can make a higher bid by keeping the quantity at 3 but increasing the digit to 6, since I have two 6s. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 4 for a digit I have good representation of. I have two 4s and two 6s, so bidding 4 4s is reasonable, assuming the opponent likely has at least two 4s as well. This is a safe incremental bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 4S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have a 5 in my hand, which is higher than the current digit. I should bid a higher quantity or the same quantity but a higher digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (98046425), I have one 5. The current bid is 4 5s, meaning at least four 5s among 16 digits. Since I only have one, the opponent would need at least three 5s, which is quite unlikely given the distribution. The probability of four or more 5s total is low, so challenging is the best move.
