Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player, I need to set an initial bid. My hand contains two 7s. Bidding 3 7s is a reasonable starting point, expecting the opponent might not have additional 7s, making this bid challenging for them.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7 ('07943829'). The current bid is 3 7s, which means there must be at least two more 7s in Player 0's hand. Given the 16 total digits, having three 7s is plausible. Making a minimal higher bid would be 3 8s. I have two 8s, which makes a bid of 3 8s quite safe, since only one more 8 would be needed in Player 0's hand to meet that count. Therefore, I will raise to 3 8s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s, and I don't have any 8s in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16, but it's unlikely to have three 8s across both hands. Challenging the bid is a strategic move to potentially win the round if the total count of 8s is less than 3.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) challenges Player 1's (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bid of 3 8s.
