Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Since the other player is Naive 50/50, I will bid slightly higher. I will increase the quantity by one and keep the digit the same. This is a relatively safe bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Since my opponent is a naive 50/50 player, they might be bluffing. However, to play it safe, I will raise the bid to 5 0s. This is a valid bid and increases the quantity.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. I could bid 6 0s, but that's not very strong. Given the bid history, it seems like the other player is incrementally increasing the bid. I don't have enough information to confidently challenge, so I will make a slightly higher bid. I will bid 6 0s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Since the opponent is a Naive 50/50 player, they might be bluffing or have a weak understanding of the game. I could challenge, but there's a decent chance there are at least six 1s in total. Instead, I'll make a slightly higher bid to test their confidence. I'll bid 7 0s, since I have two 0s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Bidding higher requires either increasing the quantity to 8 or increasing the digit. Since the other player is a naive 50/50 player, they are likely not basing their bids on their hand. I will bid 8 0s, betting that there are at least 8 zeros between both hands. I have two zeros myself, so it is not unreasonable.
