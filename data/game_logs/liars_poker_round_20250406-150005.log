--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open with an initial bid. My hand contains two 9s, two 3s, two 0s, one 1, and one 5. A conservative and reasonable opening bid based on my hand would be 3 3s, as I already hold two 3s and it's likely at least one more exists among the other players' 16 digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9, one 8, one 6, and one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s. Bidding 4 4s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid can be beaten. My hand contains the digits 4, 6, 2, 0, 1, 2, 6, and 8. I have two 6s and two 2s, but no 4s. The maximum possible quantity for any digit across all players' hands is 24, but given that there are 8 secret digits per player and 3 players, there are 24 digits in total. The bid of 4 4s seems plausible but I need to consider if I can make a valid higher bid. Since I have two 6s, bidding 5 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and digit compared to the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand. The current bid is 5 6s, which means there must be at least five 6s among the 24 digits. Since I hold zero, the other two players must collectively have all five or more 6s, which is somewhat unlikely but possible. Raising to 5 7s would only increase the digit, but I have one 7, making that risky. Increasing the quantity to 6 of any digit would be less supported by my hand. Given the absence of 6s in my hand and the improbability that the other players have five or more 6s, challenging is the best move.
