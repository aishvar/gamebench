Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 9, 2, 1, 5, 1, 4, 8, 6, and none of these are 0s. The current bid is only 1 zero, which is very plausible since I don't have any, but the opponent could easily have one or more zeros in their 8 digits. Challenging now is risky because the probability of at least one zero among 16 digits is quite high. Instead, I will make a minimal overbid with a digit I have multiple of. I have two 1s, so bidding 2 1s is a safe, incremental, and valid raise.
