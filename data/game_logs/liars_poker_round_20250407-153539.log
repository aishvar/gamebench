Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (Random(openrouter/meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor)), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the game state, I have no information about the other player's hand, so I'll start with a conservative bid on a digit that is likely to be present in many hands. I'll choose the digit 9, which is often a common digit in many hands. I'll also start with a low quantity to see how the other player reacts.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze whether the current bid of '9 4s' is reasonable. In my hand (59835227), I have 0 fours. Since there are 16 total digits in the game (8 per player), the maximum possible number of 4s is 16. My opponent claims there are at least 9 fours total. Since I have 0 fours, that would mean my opponent would need to have at least 9 fours in their hand of 8 digits, which is impossible. Therefore, the bid of '9 4s' must be a bluff and I should challenge it.
