Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and it's likely there's at least one more among the other player's 8 digits, making 3 8s a reasonable opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s. Since I only have one 8, I cannot confidently bid higher without risking a challenge. However, I also cannot be certain that the other player doesn't have at least two 8s, making the total at least 3. Given the uncertainty, I will bid 4 7s, as I have two 7s in my hand, which increases the quantity and changes the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and it's likely there could be at least two more between the two hands, making 4 total 8s a plausible bid. This also strictly outbids 4 7s by raising the digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which means there must be at least three more 8s in Player 0's hand. Given that each player has 8 digits and the distribution of digits is random, it's unlikely that Player 0 has three more 8s. Bidding higher would require me to have more 8s or a higher digit with sufficient quantity, which I don't have. Therefore, challenging the current bid is the best move.
