Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a safe bid based on my hand. Bidding 2 4s is guaranteed to be valid (total count is at least 2 from my hand alone), forcing the opponent to bid higher or challenge and lose.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '2 4s' and examining my hand '98805796', I notice that my hand contains no 4s. However, to make a valid bid, I must bid higher than '2 4s'. Since I have multiple 8s and 9s in my hand, I can consider bidding on those digits. Bidding on the digit '8' or '9' with a quantity of at least 3 would be a safe move because it increases both the quantity and the digit value compared to the current bid. Considering the distribution of my hand and the need to bid higher, bidding '3 8s' seems like a reasonable move, as it leverages the information from my hand while also taking into account the potential distribution of digits in the other player's hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which relies entirely on Player 1's hand. The probability of Player 1 having â‰¥3 8s in their 8-digit hand is low (~3-5% based on binomial distribution). Challenging here has a high likelihood of success, as their bid likely exceeds the actual count.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) challenges Player 1's (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bid of 3 8s.
