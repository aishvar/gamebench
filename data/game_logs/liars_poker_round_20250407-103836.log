Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 86546392, I have no 0s. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, it's quite plausible that Player 0 has a single 0, making a challenge risky. To maintain pressure and gather more information, I should make a safe, minimal higher bid. I have two 6s, so bidding 2 6s is a reasonable, truthful, and safe increase.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 6, 5, 4, 6, 3, 9, 2. I have no 7s, so the current bid of 2 7s depends entirely on Player 0 holding at least two 7s, which is possible but not guaranteed. Since I have two 6s, I can confidently raise the bid to 3 6s, which is a strictly higher bid (higher quantity and lower digit). This puts pressure back on Player 0 while basing my bid on known information.
