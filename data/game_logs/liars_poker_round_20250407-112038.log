Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '1 0s'. I have zero 0s in my hand (13264684). Challenging this low opening bid is risky, as the opponent only needs one 0 for it to be true (probability ~57%). I should make a higher bid. I have two 6s and two 4s. The total expected number of any digit across all 16 is 1.6. Bidding '3 6s' leverages my two 6s and assumes the opponent has at least one 6, which is statistically likely. This bid is significantly higher than '1 0s' and is based on the strength of my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand (13264684) contains zero 7s. For the current bid of '3 7s' to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must hold at least three 7s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player holding three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is low (approximately 3.8% assuming uniform distribution). Given I hold none of the bid digit, the likelihood of the bid being valid is very small. Therefore, challenging is the statistically best move.
