Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand already, so starting with 2 9s is guaranteed to be true and a safe opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have a 9 in my hand, which means there are at least 1 nine in total. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 16 digits in total, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. I will bid 3 9s to increase the quantity while choosing a higher digit is not possible at this point.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 9s, so the opponent needs at least one 9 for their bid of 3 9s to be valid. That is plausible, but still uncertain enough that Iâ€™d rather challenge than risk bidding 4 9s, which would almost surely be challenged back. I will call their bluff and challenge.
