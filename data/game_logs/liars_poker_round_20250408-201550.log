Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s, two 4s, two 0s, one 2, and one 8. Since the current bid is only 1 0s and I hold two 0s myself, I know there are at least two 0s in total, making the current bid very safe. The natural and safe progression is to increase the quantity to 2 0s, which is guaranteed true based on my hand alone.

Player 0 bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 1s, so the entire bid of 2 1s relies on the opponent having at least two 1s out of their eight digits. Statistically, the expected count of any digit per hand is roughly 0.8 (8 * 0.1), so expecting two 1s solely from the opponent is unlikely but possible. Rather than challenging this conservative bid, I can safely increase the bid by raising the digit with the same quantity based on my strong holdings. I have three 6s in my hand, so bidding 2 6s is safe and strictly higher than 2 1s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 6s (digits: 4, 6, 4, 6, 2, 0, 6, 8). The current bid is 2 7s, which is relatively low and likely plausible, so challenging now is risky. A safe and strategic move is to bid 3 6s, as I already hold three 6s, guaranteeing the bid's validity regardless of the opponent's hand.
