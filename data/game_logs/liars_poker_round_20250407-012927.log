Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 2s, one 6, one 7, one 8, and one additional 9. The most frequent digits in my hand are 2s and 9s, each appearing twice. A safe opening bid is 2 9s, reflecting my own hand and leaving room for escalation.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 08538436. The current bid is 2 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand. For the current bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least two 9s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, challenging such a low opening bid is risky. I should consider making a higher bid. My hand contains two 8s and two 3s. Bidding based on my own digits is generally safer. A bid higher than '2 9s' must have a quantity of 3 or more. Bidding '3 3s' or '3 8s' seems reasonable, as I hold two of each digit and only need the opponent to hold at least one. Bidding '3 8s' is strategically better than '3 3s' because it uses a higher digit, forcing the opponent to either bid '3 9s' or increase the quantity to 4. This bid is plausible as it only requires one 8 among the opponent's 8 digits.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8 and three 9s. The current bid is 3 8s. Since I only have one 8, for the bid to be valid, my opponent would need to have at least two 8s, which is plausible but not highly certain. However, I have three 9s, so bidding 3 9s matches the current quantity with a higher digit, which is a strictly higher bid and well supported by my hand. This is safer than challenging now.
