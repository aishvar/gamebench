Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there has been no bid yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 8, one 6, one 3, one 5, one 4, and two 1s. A common opening strategy is to bid on a digit I have multiple copies of. I have two 1s, so bidding '2 1s' is a safe and reasonable opening bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. I can raise the bid to 3 1s, which is a safe increase and still relatively low.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (80630541), I have exactly one '1'. The current bid is 3 1s, implying there are at least three '1's across both hands. Since I only have one, the opponent would need to have at least two '1's for the bid to be valid. While this is possible, it's somewhat unlikely as the average count per digit is roughly 1.6 (16 digits / 10 digits). Given the low probability of the opponent having two or more '1's, challenging here is a strong move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
