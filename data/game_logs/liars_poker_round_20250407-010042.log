Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 45318186, I have two 8s and one each of 1,3,4,5,6. Since this is the opening bid and I have two 8s, making a conservative bid of '3 8s' is reasonable. This assumes the opponent likely has at least one 8 among their 8 digits, which is fairly probable. Starting with a moderate bid leaves room for the bidding to develop while being based on known information.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. My hand (47752325) contains zero 8s. For the bid to be accurate, the opponent (Player 0) must hold at least three 8s in their 8-digit hand. Statistically, the probability of a player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is quite low (approximately 3.8% assuming random distribution). Since I hold none of the required digits, the entire burden falls on the opponent, making the bid highly suspect. Therefore, challenging is the most logical action.
