Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', indicating that there are no bids yet. As the first player, I need to make an initial bid. My hand is 44278759. I count the occurrences of each digit in my hand: 4 appears twice, 2 appears once, 7 appears twice, 5 appears once, and 9 appears once. The most frequent digit in my hand is 4 and 7, both appearing twice. I will bid on the count of digit 7, as it is one of the most frequent in my hand and might be relatively common across both hands. I will start with a conservative bid of the count of 7 being 4, assuming the other player might also have some 7s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 fours. Looking at my hand (36492660), I have zero 4s. This means all 7 or more 4s must be in Player 0's hand for their bid to be valid. Since they only have 8 digits, for there to be at least 7 total 4s, they would need at least 7 4s themselves, which is highly improbable. The probability of one hand containing 7 or more of a single digit is extremely low. Therefore, it's very likely Player 0 is bluffing or overbidding, and challenging is the best strategic move.
