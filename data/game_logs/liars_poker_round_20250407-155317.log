Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand '32964250', I count the digits: 0(1), 1(0), 2(2), 3(1), 4(1), 5(1), 6(1), 7(0), 8(0), 9(1). The most frequent digits in my hand are 2 (2 times), then several digits appear once. A good opening bid is usually on the digit I have the most of, which is 2, since I can reasonably expect the opponent to have at least one or two 2's as well. Therefore, I will start with a conservative but reasonable opening bid of 2 twos.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (Random(deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor)), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 8, 1, 7, 8, 6, 9, 1, 4. There are no 2s in my hand, so the current bid of '2 2s' is based solely on the opponent's hand. Since the opponent has bid '2 2s', they must have at least two 2s in their hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16, and my hand has no 2s, it's reasonable to challenge the bid if I believe the opponent is unlikely to have exactly two 2s. However, since the bid is relatively low (only 2 of a digit), it might be safer to make a higher bid on a digit that I have in my hand. I have two 1s, so I could bid '3 1s' (assuming the opponent has at least one 1), but since the current bid is '2 2s', I need to bid higher in either quantity or digit. Bidding '2 3s' would be a valid higher digit bid, but I have no 3s in my hand, making it risky. Alternatively, I could bid '2 4s' (I have one 4), but again, this is speculative. Given the uncertainty, challenging the current bid of '2 2s' is a reasonable move, as the opponent would need exactly two 2s in their hand for the bid to be valid, and I have none.
