Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a low bid based on my hand. I have two 3s. I will bid 2 3s to start.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have one 3 in my hand (from 76102851), so there is at least one more 3 in the other player's hand. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 2 4s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and is a valid bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I don't have any 4s in my hand. I can raise the bid to 3 0s, which is a valid increase and doesn't rely on me having any of the bid digit.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I need to either challenge it or make a higher bid. My hand is 76102851, which contains one 0. The total count of 0s across both hands is likely more than 3 since I have one 0 and my opponent could have at most 7 remaining digits with potentially more 0s. However, bidding significantly higher without knowing my opponent's hand is risky. A reasonable next step is to increase the quantity or the digit. I can bid 4 0s or 3 1s. Bidding 4 0s seems plausible because it increases the quantity, and I have some basis to believe there could be at least 4 0s in total. I choose to bid 4 0s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I don't have any 0s in my hand. I can increase the bid to 5 0s, or bid a higher digit than 0. I have two 3s and two 9s. I will bid 5 0s. It is unlikely there are 4 zeros, but it is possible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, so the total count of 0s is at least 1. The bid history shows an escalating quantity of 0s, and now it's my turn again. I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Given that there are 16 digits in total and the current bid is 5 0s, it's possible that there are more 0s. I have to consider my own hand and the likelihood. Since I have one 0, I can try to bid higher or challenge. Bidding 6 0s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity. If I had a high count of another digit, I could consider switching digits, but my hand doesn't strongly support that. Therefore, I'll increase the quantity of 0s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I don't have any 0s in my hand. The bidding on 0s has been steadily increasing. Since I don't have any 0s, it's risky to continue bidding on 0s. I could bid 7 0s, but it might be a bluff that is easily called. I have two 3s and two 9s. I could try to shift the focus to another digit. I will bid 7 3s, increasing the quantity and changing the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 3S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 7 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 3s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand is 76102851, which contains one 3. The total count of 3s across both hands must be at least one (mine) and at most 8 (if the other player has 7). Since 7 3s is a relatively high bid but still plausible, I need to think carefully. I can bid 7 4s, which is a valid higher bid because it has the same quantity but a higher digit. Alternatively, I can bid 8 0s or higher if I think there's a good chance of the count being that high. Given my hand, I see two 0s and no 4s, so bidding 7 4s seems risky. However, I can consider bidding 8 0s since there are already bids suggesting a high count of 0s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 8 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. The maximum possible number of 0s is 16. 8 0s is not an unreasonable bid, given that the other player has been consistently bidding 0s. I don't have enough information to confidently challenge. I need to bid higher. I have two 3s and two 9s. I can bid 9 0s. This is a slightly higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 9 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 0s. I have 3 zeros in my hand (0, 0). The total count of zeros across both hands must be at least 3 (my zeros) plus some zeros in Player 0's hand. Since there are 8 digits in each hand, Player 0 must have at least one zero. It's likely that Player 0 has more than one zero, given the aggressive bidding pattern on zeros. However, bidding more than 9 0s is not possible without going over 16 total digits. I should challenge the bid if I believe it's unlikely they have more than 6 zeros (since 3 + 6 = 9). Given the history, Player 0 has been pushing the bid on zeros and has a pattern of increasing the quantity. However, 9 0s is a very high bid. I need to assess the likelihood based on my hand and the bidding history. My hand has 3 zeros, so if Player 0 has 6 or more zeros, their bid is valid. It's a close call, but given the aggressive pattern of Player 0 and the fact that I have a relatively low number of zeros, I'll take a chance and challenge, believing that it's less likely they have exactly 6 or more zeros.
