Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand (13579880), I have two 8s, one 0, one 1, one 3, one 5, one 7, and one 9. Since I have two 8s in my hand, I know there are at least 2 eights in the game. Making a conservative opening bid of '2 8s' is a safe start since I can verify this quantity from my hand alone. I could bid higher, but a conservative opening gives me room to observe my opponent's bidding patterns.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, which matches the current bid of 2 8s. Challenging would be risky as the total is at least 2. Instead, I'll make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 9s, as I have one 9 and it's a higher digit than 8.

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. In my hand, I have 13579880, which contains two 8s, one 9, one 7, one 5, one 3, and one 1. The current bid is '2 9s'. I know I have one 9 in my hand, so there's at least one 9 in play. For the bid to be valid, there needs to be at least one more 9 in the opponent's hand. This is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's a risky move this early in the game. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Since I have two 8s in my hand, I could confidently bid '3 8s', but that's not valid because 8 is lower than 9. I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have any 0s, bidding on those would be risky. I'll bid '3 9s', increasing the quantity while staying with the same digit. This is reasonable because I already know of one 9 (in my hand), and I'm betting there are at least two more in the opponent's hand. If I'm wrong, I'll lose, but this seems like a strategic move at this point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which requires the total to be at least 3. Since I have one, Player 0 must have at least two. However, considering the possibility that Player 0 might be bluffing and has only one 9, making the total 2, I will challenge the bid.
