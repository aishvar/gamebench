Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid. I have one '5' in my hand. Bidding 2 5s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one '5' as well, making the bid valid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 9 in my hand (total digits: 20956784), bidding 2 9s raises the digit to 9, which is higher than 5. This bid is valid as the quantity remains the same but the digit increases. There's a chance the opponent has another 9, making the total at least 2. Raising the digit to the highest possible (9) is strategically better than increasing quantity immediately.
