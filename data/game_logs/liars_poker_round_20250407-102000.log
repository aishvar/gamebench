Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '73823851', I have no 0s, so challenging the bid of 1 0s would be risky because the opponent could easily have a 0. Since the initial bid is the lowest possible, it's standard to increase it. I have two 3s and two 8s, so a natural next step is to raise the bid by keeping the quantity at 1 but increasing the digit. The minimal strictly higher bid would be 1 1s, but since I have two 3s, a stronger bid would be 2 3s, leveraging my hand's strength while putting pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 7, 3, 8, 2, 3, 8, 5, 1. I have zero 4s, so for the current bid of 2 4s to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least two 4s, which is plausible but not certain. However, I do have two 3s. Since the previous bid was 2 3s and then raised to 2 4s, I can safely raise the quantity to 3 3s, leveraging my two 3s and the reasonable chance that the opponent has at least one 3. This is a safe and strategic higher bid.
