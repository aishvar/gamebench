Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is None and I have a hand with multiple 5s and 6s, I can confidently start with a bid that is likely to be valid and hard to challenge.

Calculating action for Player 1 (Naive 50/50)
Naive 50/50 bids 4 6s
Player 1 bids 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 2 sixes in my hand, and the current bid is 4 sixes. Given that each player has 8 digits, the maximum possible sixes is 8 (if the other player has 6 sixes). Since the current bid of 4 sixes is already higher than my visible sixes and the other player's potential maximum, it's unlikely the bid is valid. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
