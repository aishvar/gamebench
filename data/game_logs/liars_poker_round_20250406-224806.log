--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand 66385317, I have two 6s, two 3s, two 8s, one 5, one 1, and one 7. The most frequent digits in my hand are 3s, 6s, and 8s, each appearing twice. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I will choose '3 6s' as there is a good chance the opponent has at least one 6 to support this bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, meaning Player 0 must have at least two 6s for the bid to be valid. Given the uncertainty of their hand and the moderate risk of them holding exactly two 6s, challenging now avoids escalating the bid further while capitalizing on the possibility they are bluffing or overestimating their contribution.
