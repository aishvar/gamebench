Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand 18497064, I notice I have two 0s, two 4s, and two 8s. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I will bid 2 4s, as I have two of them, and it's a solid starting bid.
