Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. My hand is 29385971. I have zero 6s, meaning the opponent must have at least two 6s for their bid to be true. This is possible, but challenging is risky without more information. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 2 7s, 2 8s, 2 9s, or starting with quantity 3. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 2 9s is safe as it's guaranteed true based on my hand alone. Bidding 3 9s is also a strong option, as I already have two 9s, and only need one more 9 from the opponent's 8 digits, which is reasonably likely. Bidding 3 9s puts more pressure on the opponent than 2 9s while still being a probable bid based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 and one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which seems quite high since I only have 8 digits in total. I can bid 4 6s to increase the quantity while using a digit that I actually have. This keeps my bid valid and increases my chances of winning.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 29385971. I have zero 6s. The current bid is 4 6s, made by Player 0. For this bid to be true, Player 0 must have at least four 6s in their 8-digit hand, as I have none. The probability of a player having four or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively low. Player 0 initially bid 2 6s, then jumped to 4 6s after my bid of 3 9s. This jump seems aggressive and could be a bluff. Given I hold no 6s, challenging the claim of four 6s total seems like the statistically stronger move.
