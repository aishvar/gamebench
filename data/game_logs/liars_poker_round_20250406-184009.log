Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start by bidding on a digit I have. Bidding 2 1s is a safe and reasonable move given my hand.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 1s in my hand, making it unlikely there are many 1s overall. The current bid is only 2 1s, which is quite plausible since the opponent could easily have two or more 1s. Challenging now is risky. Instead, I will raise the bid by increasing the quantity to 2 of a higher digit I have multiple of. I have three 5s and three 6s, so bidding 2 5s or 2 6s is safe, but to make a strictly higher bid, I'll bid 2 6s since it's a higher digit than 1.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, making the current bid of 2 6s plausible if Player 1 has at least one 6. However, without certainty and considering the low bid, challenging is a reasonable move to test the validity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
