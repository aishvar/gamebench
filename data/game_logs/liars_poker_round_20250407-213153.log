Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid. I have two 8s in my hand. A safe opening bid would be to bid a small quantity of a common digit. I will bid one '8'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 eight. Looking at my hand, 56431924, I have zero 8s. Since I don't have any 8s, the only way Player 0's bid is valid is if they have at least one 8 in their hand. Given there are 16 digits total and only one 8 is claimed, this is plausible. It is risky to challenge such a low bid, as single occurrences are common. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to raise the bid slightly to maintain pressure and gather more information. I will increase the bid to 1 9s, which is a legal higher bid (since 9 > 8), and I have one 9 in my hand to support this bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. The previous bid was 1 8s. I can either increase the quantity of 9s or increase the digit. Since I have two 9s, bidding 2 9s is a safe option. I could also bid 2 of a lower digit, but that's less strategic. I'll bid 2 9s.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. It is likely that there is at least one more 9 between the opponent's hand. I will bid 2 9s to continue the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (56431924), I have only one '9'. The current bid is 2 nines, which requires there to be at least one more '9' in Player 0's hand. Since Player 0 increased the bid from 1 9s to 2 9s, it's plausible they have at least one or two '9's themselves, making the current bid reasonable. Challenging now is risky because two total '9's is quite likely. Instead, I should increase the bid. I don't have any '8's, so increasing the digit is unwise. The next minimal valid bid is 3 9s, but with only one '9' in my hand, it's unlikely there are three total. I do have two '4's, so I can increase the bid to 2 4s, which is a higher digit and equal quantity, making it a valid and safer bid based on my hand's strength.

Parse Error: Bid 2 4s is not higher than current bid 2 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (56431924), I have one '9'. The current bid is 2 nines, which means across both hands, there must be at least two 9s. Since I have one, the opponent likely has at least one or is bluffing. Two 9s are quite plausible, so challenging now is risky. To continue the game strategically, I can raise the bid by increasing the digit to 9's next highest digit, or the quantity. Since the current bid is 2 9s, the next valid higher bids could be 2 9s (impossible), 3 9s (unlikely), or 2 0s through 2 9s with a higher digit. The safest incremental bid is 2 9s upgraded to 2 9s or 2 0s, but since digit can't be equal, I must raise quantity or digit. Increasing to 3 3s is reasonable because I have two 3s in my hand, making a total of 3 plausible. Therefore, I will bid 3 3s.

Player 1 bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have zero 3s in my hand. The previous bids have been relatively low, suggesting that the total number of 8s and 9s might be limited. It's possible the opponent is bluffing with the 3s. However, to bid higher, I would need to bid at least '3 4s' or '4 3s'. Since I don't know the distribution of other numbers, and the bid is still relatively low, I will challenge. There's a chance the opponent is bluffing, and the risk of being wrong is lower at this stage.
