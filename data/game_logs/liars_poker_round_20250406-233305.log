--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the first bid and I have a hand with multiple occurrences of the digit 5, I can make an educated guess that bidding on this digit is a safe start. Since I have three 5s in my hand, bidding on 4 5s seems like a reasonable and cautious move, considering the opponent could also have some 5s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 5s in my hand. For the current bid of 4 5s to be valid, Player 0 must hold all 4 of them. Given the statistical improbability of an opponent holding exactly 4/8 cards as 5s and no 5s appearing in my hand, this bid is likely a bluff. Challenging now forces a reveal and capitalizes on their probable overbid.
