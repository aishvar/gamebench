Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 9s in my hand. Given that there are 16 digits in total (8 from each player), bidding 2 9s seems reasonable and not overly risky.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s would be risky as it relies entirely on my opponent having at least one 9. I have two 6s, so bidding 3 6s is a reasonable option, increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 2s (three 2s). However, increasing the digit to 6 seems more strategic than increasing the quantity of 2s, as it's less likely my opponent has a lot of 2s. Bidding 3 6s is a good balance of increasing the bid and leveraging my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains one 6. I also have other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 4 or higher with a suitable digit seems reasonable. I have two 9s in my hand, which could be a good option to increase the quantity and digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding higher in 9s would be a pure bluff. I have two 6s, and the previous bid involved 3 6s. I could bid 4 6s, but that's not a significant increase. I have two 2s and two 6s. I could also try to bid on 2s, but 4 2s is likely. Given the history, Player 0 seems to be focused on 9s. I will bid 5 9s to put pressure on them, hoping they don't have the cards to back it up. This is a calculated risk.

Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) bids: 5 9s

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Given that the bid history shows an increase in quantity but not in digit, and considering my hand, bidding 6 9s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity slightly based on my own digits and maintains a competitive bid without being overly aggressive.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free) bids: 6 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. The opponent has been consistently bidding up the 9s, and while it's possible they have several, it's becoming increasingly unlikely they have enough to reach 6. Given the history of escalating 9s bids, challenging now seems like the most strategic move. If they have 6 or more 9s, I lose, but if they have fewer, I win. The risk of letting the bid climb higher is too great.
