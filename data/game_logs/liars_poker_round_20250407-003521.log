Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable bid based on my hand. I have two 8s and one 6. Bidding 3 6s is a safe starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 6.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which means there must be at least three 6s in total. Since I only have one, the opponent must have at least two 6s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit seems safer, so I'll bid 3 7s, as I have two 7s in my hand, making it plausible.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. Since I have two 8s, it's reasonable to assume there might be at least one more 8 in the opponent's hand. Bidding 4 8s increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a strong bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which means there must be at least 4 eights in total. Since I only have one 8, there would need to be at least 3 more 8s in the other player's hand. Given the bid history and the fact that the other player has already bid 4 8s, it seems unlikely that they have 3 more 8s. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
