Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and raise the digit. Since increasing the quantity to 2 seems reasonable given there are 16 digits total, and I already have one 0, it's quite likely there is at least one more 0 in Player 0's hand. Therefore, I'll raise the bid to 2 0s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 2, 3, 4, 1, 0, 4, 6, 6. This means I have one 1 and one 0. The current bid is 2 1s, so Player 0 claims there are at least two 1s across both hands. Since I only have one 1, this bid is plausible if Player 0 has at least one 1, which is reasonably likely. To avoid challenging too early on a plausible bid, I should raise. The minimal higher bid would be 2 2s, but since I have no 2s, that is risky. Alternatively, I can bid 3 0s since I have one 0 and it's likely Player 0 has one or two zeros as well, making 3 zeros plausible. Therefore, I will raise to 3 0s.
