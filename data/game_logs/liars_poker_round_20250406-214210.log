Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 40483129, I notice it contains two 4s and other digits. Since I have to make a bid that is strictly higher than 'None', I can start by bidding on a digit I have at least one of. Bidding on the digit '4' seems reasonable because I have two of them, and it's a relatively low digit, making it easier to have at least one more '4' in the other player's hand. Thus, bidding 3 4s seems like a safe and reasonable start, considering I already have two and it's possible the other player could have at least one more.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 5s and my hand of 40483129, I notice that I do not have any 5s. However, to make a bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have enough information about the opponent's hand to confidently challenge, and I have a couple of digits that could potentially be common, I should look for a reasonable increase. Noticing my hand, I have multiple occurrences of the digit 4 and other digits, but none of them are 5 or higher in a quantity that would comfortably allow me to bid higher than 3 5s without risking a challenge. Given the digits I have, bidding on a digit I actually possess could be safer, but since I must bid higher, I could consider bidding on a higher digit assuming my opponent might not have it in abundance either. However, without specific knowledge of their hand, any bid I make is speculative. Considering the safest increase would be to bid on a digit that is at least as likely to appear as the 5, and knowing that 4s and other lower digits are less risky but must be in higher quantities, I could consider a bid that reflects a balance between likelihood and the information I have from my hand.
