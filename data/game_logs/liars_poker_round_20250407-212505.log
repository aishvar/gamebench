Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I choose a bid that balances aggression and safety. My hand has two 0s. Bidding 3 of 0 is plausible because the opponent might have at least one 0 in their 8 digits. This gives a total of at least 3 (if they have one), making the bid valid. Starting with a lower quantity on a common digit like 0 encourages others to either escalate or challenge, while minimizing the risk of an immediate loss.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 zeros. Looking at my hand (65909521), I have one zero. For the total zeros across both hands to be at least 3, the opponent must have at least 2 zeros. Given each player has 8 digits, it's plausible for the opponent to have 2 or more zeros, making the bid reasonable. To avoid challenging a likely valid bid, I should raise. The next minimal valid bid is either increasing the quantity to 4 zeros or bidding at least 3 ones (since ones are higher digit-wise). I have one '1' in my hand, so bidding 3 ones is plausible and strategically safer, as it pressures the opponent without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. Your hand has only 1 '1', so the opponent needs at least 2 '1's for the bid to be valid. The probability of the opponent having 2 or more '1's in their 8 digits is low (~19%). Challenging offers an 81% chance of winning. Bidding higher (e.g., 3 6s) has lower certainty than challenging. Thus, challenging is optimal.
