Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player, I can choose any bid. I have two 9s in my hand, which is the highest digit I hold. Bidding 2 9s sets a reasonable starting point, considering the total possible digits across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 3 9s is a reasonable bid, as it's not overly aggressive. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 1s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s or 0s. Bidding 3 9s is a good option as it is a relatively small increase and could potentially succeed.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which requires at least three 9s in total. Since I only have two, it's possible the other player has none or one. Challenging the bid is a strategic choice because if the other player has none, the total would be two, making the bid invalid. If they have one, the total would be three, making the bid valid. Given the uncertainty, challenging is a calculated risk.
