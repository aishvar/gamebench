Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. I have two 3s in my hand (72845633). With 16 total digits in play (2 players * 8 digits), the expected number of any digit is 1.6. Having two 3s gives me a good basis for a bid. Bidding '3 3s' is a reasonable opening move. It assumes the opponent has at least one 3, which is statistically probable (roughly a 57% chance they have at least one 3). It's a safe but informative start.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand, which means there are at least 2 3s accounted for. The current bid is 3 3s, so I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I can confidently say there are at least 2 3s in play, I will bid 4 3s to make a valid higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 72845633. I have two 3s. The current bid is 4 3s, made by Player 1 after I bid 3 3s. For Player 1's bid to be true, there must be at least four 3s in total across both hands (16 digits). Since I have two 3s, Player 1 needs to have at least two 3s in their 8-digit hand. While my initial bid of 3 3s might suggest I have 3s, the probability of Player 1 having two or more 3s in their hand is relatively low (approximately 19%). It's more likely (around 81%) that they have zero or one 3, making their bid of 4 3s false. Bidding higher, such as 5 3s, would require Player 1 to have three 3s, which is even less likely. Bidding 4 of another digit is weak as I only have one of most other digits. Therefore, challenging seems the most statistically sound move.
