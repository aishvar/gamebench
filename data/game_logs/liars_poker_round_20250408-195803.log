Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which makes bidding on 6s very safe. The current bid of 1 0s is very low, so raising the bid to 2 6s is both a legal and confident move. Even if my opponent challenges, I already support the bid with my two 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s, and I have no 7s in my hand. That means all 7s must come from my opponentâ€™s 8 random digits. Statistically, there's roughly an 81% chance that my opponent holds fewer than 2 7s (since the probability of having 2 or more 7s in 8 digits is only about 19%). This makes challenging a strong play in this situation.
