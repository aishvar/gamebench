Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can make the first bid. My hand is 12581506, which contains two 1s, one 2, one 5, two 6s, and one 8. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the count of digits in my hand. I have two 1s and two 6s, which are the highest counts. I can bid on either 1s or 6s. Bidding 3 1s seems like a safe and reasonable starting point as it slightly increases the quantity based on my hand.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 1s at all. Since the total number of digits is 16 and I hold 8 of them with zero 1s, the other player would need to have all 3 or more 1s to make the bid valid. The probability of one player holding 3 or more of a specific digit is relatively low. Given this, challenging the bid is a reasonable move.
