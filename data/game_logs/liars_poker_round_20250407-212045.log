Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. The digit '0' appears once in my hand. Assuming the opponent has a similar distribution, a bid of '0' with a quantity of 2 is reasonable. This bid is low enough to be safe but still initiates the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. The digit '9' appears once in my hand. Assuming the opponent has a similar distribution, a bid of 2 for the digit '9' is reasonable. This bid is low enough to be safe if challenged, but high enough to start the bidding process.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 nines. Looking at my hand, I have no 9s at all (digits are 0, 2, 1, 4, 4, 6, 8, 6). Since there are only 16 digits in total, and I have zero 9s, the entire count of 9s depends solely on Player 0's hand. For the bid of 2 nines to be true, Player 0 must have at least 2 nines. This is quite unlikely, as the expected number of 9s in a random hand of 8 digits is less than 1. Therefore, it's statistically improbable that there are 2 or more 9s in total. The best move is to challenge the bid.
