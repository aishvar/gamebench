Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid, I want to make a reasonable starting bid that isn't too high, but also isn't trivially easy to beat. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 1 Eight seems like a good starting point. It's plausible, but not overly aggressive.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 eight. Looking at my hand (17964456), I have zero 8s. Since there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's, the total maximum number of 8s is 16. However, given I have none, the opponent would need to have at least one 8 to make the bid valid. One 8 is quite plausible in the other hand, so challenging now would be risky. The safest strategy is to make a minimal valid raise. The next valid bid would be 1 9s (since '1 9s' is higher than '1 8s' by digit), or 2 0s (increasing quantity). I have one 9 in my hand, so bidding 1 9s is reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Player 1 previously bid 1 8s, and I bid 1 8s before that. It's unlikely Player 1 has a lot of 9s, as they bid 1 8s previously. Bidding 2 9s is risky, as it's a significant increase and I have no 9s to contribute. However, bidding 1 9s would be a valid bid, but it doesn't increase the bid. Therefore, I will challenge the bid, as I believe it's unlikely Player 1 has enough 9s to make the bid valid.
