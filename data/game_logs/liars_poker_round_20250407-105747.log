Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I see two 9s, two 6s, one 3, one 5, one 2, and one 0. The current bid is very low at only 1 zero, which I can confirm is true since I have one zero myself. To safely increase the bid, I can bid 2 zeros, supported by my own hand, and it's likely that at least one more zero exists in Player 0's hand. This is a conservative and safe bid that increases the quantity.
