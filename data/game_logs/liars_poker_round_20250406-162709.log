Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (68847904), I see I have two 8s, one 7, one 4, one 9, and three other digits. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the most frequent digit in my hand or a digit I think is likely to appear in both hands. Since I have two 8s, bidding on 8s seems reasonable. I'll start with a bid of 5 8s, assuming that between the two players, there might be at least 5 8s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 7, 5, 3, 2, 2, 8, 9, 3. I have one 8, so the total count of 8s could be higher than 5. However, I don't have enough information about Player 0's hand. I should consider bidding higher than 5 if possible or challenging if I think it's unlikely.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I have two 8s in my hand (68847904), so I know there are at least two 8s. The total count of 8s must be at least 2 (my 8s) plus one (the minimum Player 1 has to have to make the bid somewhat reasonable), making it 3. The bid of 6 8s is already quite high but not impossible. However, I can see that I have an 8, and it's possible that the other player is bluffing or has more 8s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 7 is a possibility. Since I have an 8, bidding 7 8s seems like a good move as it slightly increases the quantity, making it harder for the other player to challenge without risking losing if they don't have enough 8s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 8s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is the best option. My hand contains the digits 7, 5, 3, 2, 2, 8, 9, 3. I have two 8s and two 2s, and other digits appear once or not at all. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and with 8 digits in my hand, I can only contribute so much to any count. Given that the bid is 7 8s and I have two 8s, I should consider if I can safely bid higher or if challenging is more prudent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity and increase the digit. Since I know there are at least 2 eights (one in my hand and at least one in the opponent's hand because they bid 8 8s), I can bid a higher quantity. The next possible bid is 9 0s or 8 9s. Given that I don't have information about the distribution of other digits in my opponent's hand, I will bid 9 0s as it is a relatively safe and higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 0s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I must consider my hand and the current bid. My hand contains the digits 7, 5, 3, 2, 2, 8, 9, 3. I have a total of 8 digits. The current bid of 9 0s seems high but I have no 0s. I should bid higher than 9, or bid a digit that I know I have. I see I have two 2s and two 3s, and one 8. A reasonable bid could be 10 2s as I have two 2s and this increases the quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 10 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 2s. I need to make a bid that is higher than this. I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand is 68847904, which means I have no 2s. The previous bids were about 8s and then 0s, suggesting that Player 1 might have some 2s and possibly other low digits. However, bidding 11 2s seems too high given that I have no 2s and it's unlikely both players have 5 or more 2s. I should consider increasing the digit instead. Bidding 10 3s is a reasonable next step as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit, making it a valid and not overly aggressive bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 10 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 3s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 7, 5, 3, 2, 2, 8, 9, 3. I have two 3s and two 2s, and other digits appear once or not at all. The bid of 10 3s seems high but I only have two 3s. I should consider if there's a higher digit I can bid on or increase the quantity slightly if I have enough of that digit. Since I have two 3s and the bid is for 10 3s, I could try to increase the quantity or the digit. However, I don't have enough of any single digit to significantly increase the quantity beyond 10. I can try to bid slightly higher on a digit I have multiple instances of or bid on a higher digit with a lower quantity. I have two 2s and two 3s, so bidding on 2s or 3s seems reasonable. However, bidding 11 of any digit seems risky without knowing the distribution of other digits. I will challenge the bid because I think it's unlikely that Player 0 has 10 or more 3s, given that there are only 16 digits total and two players.
