Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I can make the first bid. Looking at my hand (99347584), I see that I have two 9s and no other repeated digits more than twice. A reasonable starting bid could be to bid on the most frequent digit in my hand, which is 9. I have two 9s, so bidding '2 9s' seems like a safe and reasonable starting point.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 30643102, I have no 9s. Since there are 16 digits total and I hold zero 9s, the opponent must have at least 2 9s for their bid to be valid. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely given average distribution (~1.6 per digit). Given the early stage of bidding and the relatively low bid, it's risky to challenge now. Instead, I'll increase the bid slightly with a common digit I have multiple of. I have two 0s, so bidding 3 0s is a reasonable escalation that leverages my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. The previous bid was 2 9s, and I have two 9s, so it's likely that my opponent has at least one 0. However, the total count of 0s is unlikely to be very high since I have none. I can bid higher than 3 0s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 3 1s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 1S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 30643102, I have two 0s and one 1. The current bid is 3 1s. Since I only have one 1, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least two 1s, which is plausible but somewhat unlikely. However, I have two 0s, and I've already bid 3 0s earlier, which the opponent didn't challenge, suggesting they might have at least one 0 as well. Therefore, increasing the quantity on 0s to 4 seems like a safe and natural higher bid, as it's likely there are at least 4 zeros combined.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have no 0s in my hand, which means there are 4 or more 0s in the opponent's hand. This is possible but seems unlikely since it would mean half of their digits are 0s. However, I should be cautious. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 4 1s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit. It's a safer move that doesn't overly commit me to a very high quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 1s (digits: 3,0,6,4,3,1,0,2). The current bid is 4 1s, so the opponent is claiming there are at least four 1s across both hands. Since I hold only two, the opponent would need to have at least two 1s as well. While that's possible, it's somewhat unlikely given the distribution. Also, since it's early in the game and bids are still relatively low, challenging now might catch an overbid. Therefore, I will challenge.
