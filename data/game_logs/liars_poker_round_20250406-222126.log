Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I hold three 6s in my hand, ensuring that there are at least three 6s in total. The current bid of 1 0s is very low and easily surpassed by a bid based on my strong holding. By bidding '3 6s', I not only raise the bid in a strictly valid manner but also leverage the safety of my hand, forcing my opponent into a difficult position.
