Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s and two 9s, which are strong digits to bid on. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I will bid 2 8s, as I already have two myself, making it likely that there are at least two 8s in total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s and two 3s in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s. Since I don't have any 8s, challenging seems risky. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable move, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s and no 5s. The current bid is 3 5s, which I cannot confidently challenge as unlikely, since my hand alone could easily hide zero 5s, but the opponent might have three or more. However, since I have two 8s, and the previous bid was 2 8s, I can reasonably increase the bid to 3 8s, matching the quantity of the current bid but with a higher digit, which is a legal and strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 5s and one 6 in my hand. While I don't have any 8s, I can make a reasonable bid by increasing the digit to 6 and keeping the quantity the same. This bid is likely to be valid and puts pressure on the opponent.
