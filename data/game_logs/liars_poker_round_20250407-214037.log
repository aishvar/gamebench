Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my first turn. I should start with a conservative bid to test the waters. Analyzing my hand (37182080), I have 3 '7's, 1 '3', 1 '1', 1 '8', 1 '2', and 1 '0'. The highest count of any digit in my hand is 3 (for the digit '7'). Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and there are two players, a bid of '3 7' seems reasonable and not too high to be suspicious.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one '7'. The current bid is 3 sevens, so for that to be valid, the opponent must have at least 2 sevens. Given typical digit distributions, having 2 or more sevens in a single 8-digit hand is possible but not very likely. The probability decreases as the quantity increases. Since I only have 1 seven, and the total needed is 3, it's a reasonable risk to challenge. Alternatively, I could bid higher, but raising to 4 sevens seems unlikely, and changing to a higher digit with at least 3 counts is risky. Therefore, the optimal move is to challenge the current bid.
