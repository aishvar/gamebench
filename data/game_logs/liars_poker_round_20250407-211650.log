Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand '38407095', I will count the occurrences of each digit: 3(1), 8(1), 4(1), 0(2), 7(1), 9(1), 5(1). The digit '0' appears twice, which is the most frequent in my hand. Statistically, zeros tend to be common, so starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid of 2 zeros is a safe choice. This bid is neither too aggressive nor too weak and sets a solid foundation for the bidding phase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 0s'. I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or challenge. My hand contains one '0'. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and there are 2 players, the total count of '0's across both hands could potentially be higher than 2. However, without knowing Player 0's hand, I must make an educated guess. Since my goal is to make a higher bid or challenge, I should look for a digit in my hand that could potentially be higher than the current bid when considering both hands. I have one '0', so bidding '2 0s' or lower would not be strategic. I see I have several digits, but no other obvious high counts. I will bid on a digit that I have in my hand and seems plausible to be higher than '0'. I have 1 '1', no '1's are bid yet, so I can start with '1 1s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 0s'. I need to either make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains one '0'. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit across both players' hands is 16 and the current bid is only 2, it's reasonable to assume that there could be more than 2 zeros in total, but not extremely high. However, without information on Player 0's hand, I must focus on my own. Since I have one '0', and assuming Player 0 might have one as well (making 2), bidding a higher quantity of a lower digit or a higher digit with a reasonable quantity seems strategic. I have multiple high digits but focusing on a digit I know I have seems wise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 3/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have 1 zero in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and there are 2 players, I should consider the possibility of Player 0 having 1 zero as well, making the total 2 zeros, which matches the current bid. However, I need to make a strategic decision based on my hand and potential risks. Since I don't have a clear higher quantity of any digit and my goal is to either make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should look for a digit that could potentially be higher than 2 in total count across both hands.

Player 1 bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (38407095), I have two 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, meaning there must be at least one more 9 in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. Since Player 1 just raised to 3 9s, it is plausible they have at least one or two 9s themselves, making the total count of 9s likely 3 or even more. Challenging now risks losing if they indeed have one or more 9s. A safe strategy is to increase the bid conservatively. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing to 3 0s is invalid as it does not exceed in quantity. Instead, I will raise to 3 9s â†’ 3 9s is current, so I must bid at least 4 of any digit or 3 of a higher digit (which is impossible). I will bid 4 0s, since I have two 0s and previously Player 1 did not challenge my 2 0s bid, indicating they may have some 0s as well.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing the current bid of '4 0s' made by Player 0, I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is the best option. The current bid is 4 zeros. Looking at my hand: 96943678, I count 2 zeros. I do not have enough information about Player 0's hand, but I can calculate the potential for a higher bid. If I bid on a digit that appears frequently in my hand, I might be able to make a credible bid. My hand contains 2 zeros, 1 fours, 1 six, 1 seven, 1 eight, 1 nine, and 2 nines are not present but 1 nine is. The digit '9' appears once in my hand. Given that the last bid was on '0s' and I have only 2 zeros, bidding on a different digit might be safer. However, I must consider if bidding higher on '0s' or switching to another digit is more strategic. Since I have 1 nine and the previous bid was about zeros, I could try to bid on nines or another digit. But first, let's evaluate the challenge option.

Player 1 bids: 5 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 38407095, I have two 9s. The current bid is 5 nines, so for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least 3 nines in their hand of 8 digits. Given typical digit distribution, having 3 or more nines in 8 digits is unlikely (~10% chance). The opponent might be bluffing or overestimating. Since 5 is a relatively high bid for nines and I only hold 2, the probability that there are 5 or more total is low. Therefore, the best strategic move is to challenge the bid.
