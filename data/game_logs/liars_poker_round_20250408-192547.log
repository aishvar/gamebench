Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand and no current bid has been made, so it's a good opportunity to start with a credible bid based on my strength. Given that the expected count of any digit in 16 cards is about 1.6 and I already hold 2 sevens, bidding 2 7s is reasonable and puts the pressure on my opponent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 1, one 2, one 5, one 6, one 9, and one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s. Given that I have no 7s and only 16 digits total, it's unlikely that there are enough 7s to meet the bid. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
