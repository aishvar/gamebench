Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 2s, one 0, one 4, one 6, and one 7. A safe opening bid is to choose a digit I have multiple of, such as 2s or 1s. I will start with '2 2s' as my opening bid, reflecting the two 2s in my hand, which is reasonable and conservative.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 2, 7, 0, 1, 4, 6, 2, 1. There are zero 3s in my hand. Since there are 16 digits total, and I hold none of the 3s, the opponent would need to have at least 2 or more 3s to satisfy their bid of 2 3s. Given the distribution, it's plausible they have 2 or more 3s, so challenging now is risky. Instead, I will make a minimal higher bid by increasing the quantity to 2 and the digit to 4 (since I hold one 4), making it a safe incremental bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (27014621), I have no 5s, so the current bid of 2 5s relies entirely on my opponent having at least two 5s, which is somewhat unlikely but plausible. To make a safe higher bid, I assess my own digits: I have two 2s and two 1s. Since the last bid was 2 5s, I can raise to 2 6s, 2 7s, 2 8s, or 2 9s, but I don't have any of those digits, making those risky. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 3 of a digit I hold multiple of. I have two 2s, so it's reasonable to bid 3 2s, assuming the opponent might have at least one 2. This is a safer incremental bid than challenging now.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (27014621), I have two 2s and one 1, zero 3s. The current bid is 3 3s. Since I have zero 3s, for Player 1's bid to be valid, they would need at least three 3s themselves, which is unlikely given they only have eight digits. The probability of them having three or more 3s is low, making the bid suspicious. Therefore, challenging now is the best strategic move.
