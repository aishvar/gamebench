Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no previous bids, I need to make a valid bid. I have two 3s in my hand, so I can start with a bid of 2 3s, which is reasonable and allows me to establish a presence in the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. I could bid higher, but since the bid is relatively low, and I don't have many of any other digit, it's safer to bid a slightly higher quantity with a different digit. I will bid 3 4s.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s and one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s. I can make a bid that is higher than the current one. Since I have two 3s, I can bid 4 3s, which increases the quantity while staying within the digits I have. This seems reasonable because it leverages my hand effectively.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. I could bid higher, but I am unsure if there are at least four 3s. I could bid 4 4s, which is a slightly safer bid since I don't have any 4s, but I'll increase the quantity to 5 and bid 5 0s, as 0 is the lowest digit and I don't have any 0s in my hand. This seems like a reasonable way to proceed.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have two 3s and one 2 in my hand, but no 0s. To make a valid higher bid, I can bid 6 2s, which increases the quantity while changing the digit from 0 to 2, which I have. This seems reasonable given my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 2S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 6 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. I don't have any 2s in my hand. Bidding higher seems risky without knowing the distribution of digits. I will bid a slightly higher quantity of a different digit, increasing the quantity to 7 and choosing the digit 0, as I don't have any 0s and it's a relatively safe option.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 7 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. I have no 0s in my hand, and the previous bids suggest that Player 1 is likely bluffing. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16, it's improbable that there are 7 or more 0s when I have none. Therefore, I should challenge the last bid.
