--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. In my hand, I have two 2s, two 1s, two 2s (counted once), one 3, one 4, one 5, and one 6. A conservative opening bid is 2 2s, reflecting the two 2s I hold. This is a safe and reasonable opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 2s in my hand, so the opponent must have all 2s. The probability of them having â‰¥2 2s in 8 random digits is low (~18.7%). Given the high risk/reward ratio and the relatively weak bid (2 2s), challenging is statistically favorable.
