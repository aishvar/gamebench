--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 43756092, I have one '2'. The current bid is 3 2s, which requires at least two '2's in the opponent's hand to be valid. Given that the average count of any digit across 16 digits is roughly 1.6, it's plausible but not guaranteed. However, since I have only one '2', making a higher bid with '2's would be risky. Instead, I notice I have two '0's in my hand. Bidding 3 3s or higher 3s is not safer since I have zero 3s and no information about opponent's hand. The safer strategic move is to increase the quantity and switch to a digit I have a good count of. I will bid 4 0s, leveraging my two '0's and the reasonable chance that the opponent has at least two '0's, which is plausible.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. I could bid 4 1s, which is a slightly higher bid. However, since I have a 2 in my hand, and the previous bid was 3 2s, I will bid 4 2s. This is a safe increase.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 2S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 43756092, I have exactly one 2. The current bid is 4 2s, which requires at least four 2s among all 16 digits. Since I only have one, the opponent would need to have at least three 2s for the bid to be valid. The probability of an opponent having three or more 2s in their eight digits is quite low. Therefore, it's reasonable to challenge the bid.
