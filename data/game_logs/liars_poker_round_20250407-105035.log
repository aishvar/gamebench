Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no zeros. Since the current bid is only 1 zero, it's quite plausible given the total 16 digits that there is at least one zero between both hands. Challenging now would likely lose. To increase the bid, I look at the digits I have many of. I have two 3s, two 8s, two 9s, one 4, one 5, one 6. The most I have are two 3s, two 8s, and two 9s. A safe next bid is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity, so I can bid 1 1s, 1 2s, 1 3s, or better yet, 2 3s, leveraging my two 3s. Since I hold two 3s myself, bidding '2 3s' is safe and strictly higher than '1 0s'.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 65349381, I have two 3s and one 4. The current bid is 2 4s, and since I only have one 4, for that bid to be valid, Player 0 must have at least one 4, which is plausible. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the digit at quantity 2 (to 2 5s or higher) or increase the quantity (to 3 of any digit). I have two 3s, so bidding 3 3s leverages my hand strength and is reasonable, as it requires only one more 3 from Player 0's hand, which is likely.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 4. The current bid is 3 4s, which means there must be at least two 4s in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. With 8 digits in the opponent's hand, having two or more 4s is plausible but not guaranteed. Since it's still early in the bidding and the bid is not overly aggressive, I can safely raise by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have two 3s, but since the current bid is already 3 4s, the next valid minimal bid would be 3 5s. This increment is reasonable and keeps the pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 65349381, I have two 6s. The current bid is 3 6s. Since I hold two 6s myself, it's quite plausible that the opponent has at least one 6, making 3 6s a reasonable bid. Challenging now would be risky. The minimal higher bid would be 3 7s, but I don't have any 7s, and statistically, the chance of four 6s is moderate. A safer approach is to increase the quantity to 4 and stick with 3s, as I have two 3s, making 4 3s plausible. This is a conservative yet valid higher bid.
