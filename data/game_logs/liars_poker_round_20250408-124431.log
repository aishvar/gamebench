Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s and two 5s, making these digits strong candidates. Starting with a conservative yet credible bid is wise at this stage. I'll choose to bid on the digit 9, as higher digits give me more flexibility for future bids. A bid of 3 9s is reasonable, as I already hold two 9s, requiring only one more from the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 4, 3, 4, which contains zero 9s. Since I have none, the entire bid of 3 9s depends on my opponent holding at least 3 of them in their 8 digits, which is quite unlikely. The probability of the opponent having 3 or more 9s out of 8 digits is low, so challenging is the best move.
