Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (78159427), I see that I have two 7s. A reasonable starting bid could be based on the digits I have. I'll bid on a digit that I have, starting with a relatively low quantity. Bidding 3 7s seems like a good starting point as it reflects a slight increase from my actual count, making it somewhat believable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my hand contains two 7s and I know there are 8 secret digits per player, I should consider the possibility of other players having 7s as well. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24, bidding a higher quantity seems risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding a higher digit with the same or higher quantity could be strategic. I have two 7s and two 8s and one 9, but I don't know if they are enough to make a higher bid confidently. I will increase the quantity and bid on a higher digit to make it more challenging for others.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge the current bid of '4 8s' or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (60140392), I have zero 8s. For there to be at least 4 8s total, the other two players would need to have at least 4 8s between them. While this is possible, it means they would need to have a somewhat high concentration of 8s. I do have one 9 in my hand, so I could bid '4 9s', which would be higher than '4 8s'. However, this would require the other players to have 3 more 9s, which is risky. I could also increase the quantity to 5 of a digit I have multiple of (like 0s, of which I have two). Given that I have no 8s in my hand, and the bid is already at 4, I think challenging is the safer option.
