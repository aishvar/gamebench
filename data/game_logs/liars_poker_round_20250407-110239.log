Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have one 0, one 2, two 6s, one 4, one 5, one 7, and one 8 in my hand. A safe starting bid would be to bid on a digit I have, increasing the quantity slightly. I will bid 1 0s as it's a low digit and I have one in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, making it less likely that there is more than one 0 across both hands. However, since the current bid is only 1 0s, it's quite plausible that my opponent has one 0, so challenging now would be risky. The minimal safe move is to raise the digit while keeping the quantity at 1. I will bid 1 1s since I have one 1 in my hand, making it a reasonable and safe higher bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 1 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. Bidding 2 0s is a valid and conservative bid, as I have one 0 in my hand. It's a slight increase in quantity and a lower digit, which is reasonable given my hand. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have, like 1 2s, 1 4s, 1 5s, 1 6s, 1 7s, or 1 8s. However, sticking with 2 0s is a safer option as it doesn't reveal much about my hand.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 2 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 37554197, which contains no 0s but two 7s and two 5s. Since the current bid is 2 0s, I likely have zero 0s, so it's risky to challenge now because the opponent could easily have two or more 0s. To safely raise, I can bid 2 7s, matching the quantity but increasing the digit to 7, which I know I have two of. This is a valid higher bid and leverages my hand strength.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 7S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 3 7s would be a reasonable increase, but it's risky as I only have one 7 myself. Bidding 3 8s is also possible given I have one 8, but the digit is higher. I could also bid 3 0s, but the history shows a lot of focus on 0s already. Given my hand, a safe but potentially successful bid would be 3 6s, as I have two 6s. However, to be more aggressive and potentially bluff, I'll bid 3 7s, hoping my opponent doesn't have many 7s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, which would require at least one more 7 in Player 0's hand. Given that Player 0 confidently raised to 3 7s, it's plausible they have at least one 7, making the bid reasonable. Rather than challenging now, a safer move is to increase the bid slightly. Since I have two 5s as well, a good option is to bid 3 9s, which is a higher digit at the same quantity, and I also hold one 9 to support this bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. It's unlikely that Player 1 has three 9s, given the previous bids and the limited number of digits. While I could bid higher, challenging seems like the better play here. The bid history shows a pattern of escalating bids, and challenging now could potentially end the round favorably.
