Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid in the game. Looking at my hand (72266998), I have: one 7, one 2, two 6s, one 9, and two 8s. Since I have two 6s, two 8s, and two 9s, these are good candidates for my bid. I'll bid on 8s since I have two of them, and it's reasonable to expect the opponent might have at least one more. I'll start with a conservative bid of 3 8s, which means I'm claiming there are at least 3 eights in total between both players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s. Since the current bid is 3 8s, there only needs to be one more 8 in the opponent's hand to meet the bid, which is quite plausible. Therefore, challenging now is risky. A safe and strategic move is to increase the bid slightly. I will bid 3 9s, which is a minimal legal raise, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which means there need to be at least 3 9s total between both players. Since I have 1, Player 1 would need to have at least 2 more 9s for this bid to be valid. While this is possible, I have strong digits I can bid with. I have two 6s and two 2s in my hand. Since I need to increase the bid, I could bid 4 2s, 4 6s, or 4 9s. Bidding 4 9s is risky since I only have 1. Bidding 4 2s or 4 6s is safer since I have 2 of each, meaning I only need Player 1 to have 2 more. Given that I have two 6s and 6 is a higher digit than 2, I'll bid 4 6s.

Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 81600847, I have one 6. The current bid is 4 6s, which means there must be at least four 6s across both hands. Since I only have one, the opponent would need at least three 6s to make the bid valid. Given the distribution of digits, having three or more 6s in their hand is unlikely. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move here.
