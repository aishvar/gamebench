--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s and two 2s, which are my strongest counts. Opening with '2 5s' is a conservative but solid first bid, reflecting the two 5s I hold, and sets a baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s. Bidding 3 5s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 5s. The current bid is 3 5s, which is plausible since I already hold two, and my opponent likely has at least one. Bidding 4 5s would be risky without more 5s in my hand. Looking at other digits, I have two 2s and two 0s. Bidding 3 6s or 3 8s isn't increasing quantity, only digit, which is a minimal raise but still valid. Given my two 2s, an effective and safe higher bid is 3 2s, which matches quantity but higher digit, advancing the game without overcommitting.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s, made by Player 0. I have a 3 and a 6 in my hand. Since the current bid is only 3, I can safely increase the quantity to 4 without risking a challenge. I will also increase the digit to 7, as it's higher than 6.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 25851062, I have zero 7s. Since there are 16 digits total and I have none, the opponent would need to have all 4 or more 7s in their hand to make the bid of 4 7s valid. This is unlikely, as having 4 or more of a single digit in 8 digits is rare. Given the improbability, the best move is to challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
