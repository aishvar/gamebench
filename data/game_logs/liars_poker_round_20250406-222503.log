--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand (99042836) has no 1s, so the current bid of 2 1s relies entirely on the opponentâ€™s unknown 8 digits. Statistically, there's only about an 18-19% chance that the opponent has at least 2 ones, making the bid very unlikely to be true. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
