Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable bid based on my hand. I have two 7s and two 2s. Bidding 3 7s is a safe starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 7.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 7s. Since there are only 8 digits in my hand and 8 digits in the opponent's hand, the maximum possible 7s is 2 (from the opponent's hand). Bidding 4 7s or higher is impossible, so challenging is the best move.
