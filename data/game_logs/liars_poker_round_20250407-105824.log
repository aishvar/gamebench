Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 1s. Bidding '3 1s' is a reasonable opening bid.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 02795287, which contains no 1s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have any 1s, I will increase the digit. The next higher digit is 2, but I have two 2s. So, bidding 3 2s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I don't have any 2s in my hand. To play it safe, I will raise the bid to 4 3s, since I have two 3s in my hand.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 02795287, which contains one 3. The total count of 3s across both players must be at least 1 (mine) + unknown (opponent's). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have two 7s and no other high-frequency digits, bidding 4 7s seems like a reasonable move as it increases the digit and keeps the quantity the same, making it a valid and potentially believable bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I don't have any 7s in my hand. It's possible my opponent is bluffing. I could challenge, but there's a chance they actually have enough 7s. I will play it safe and bid slightly higher. I will bid 5 0s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have two 0s in my hand (02795287), so there are at least 2 0s in total. The maximum possible 0s is 16, and it's unlikely that there are 5 0s in total. However, I should consider bidding higher on a different digit or challenging. I have a 7 and other digits, but bidding on 7s might be too high since the quantity is already 5. I can either challenge or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Bidding 5 1s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. Bidding 6 1s seems like a safe move, and it's a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 1S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have two 1s in my hand (02795287). The total count of 1s across both hands must be at least 2 (mine) plus some from Player 0's hand. Since Player 0 bid 6 1s, it's likely they have at least 4 1s, making the total count at least 6. Bidding 7 1s would be a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity. However, I should also consider the likelihood of having more 1s and the risk of being challenged. Given that I have two 1s and the bid history suggests Player 0 has a significant number of 1s, bidding 7 1s seems plausible. I will bid 7 1s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. It's possible there are at least seven 1s in total, but it's also possible the opponent is bluffing. Since I have two 1s, I can confidently bid a slightly higher amount. I'll bid 8 1s.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 8 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand is 02795287, which contains two 1s. The total count of 1s across both players must be at least 2 (my 1s) and at most 10 (if the other player had all 8 1s). The current bid of 8 1s is within this range. However, given that the bid has been escalating and my hand doesn't have a high number of 1s, it's likely the other player is bluffing or has a good number of 1s. I will increase the quantity to 9 1s, as increasing the digit to 2s or higher would require a quantity of 8 or lower to be valid, which is not possible. Bidding 9 1s is a reasonable escalation.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 9 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. To increase the bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I will increase the quantity to 10 1s, which seems like a reasonable increase given the bidding history.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 10 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 1s. My hand is 02795287, which contains two 1s. The total count of 1s across both players must be at least my count (2) plus the count bid by the other player (10), making it at least 12. Since the maximum quantity is 16 and there are already 10 1s bid by the other player, bidding 11 1s or higher is reasonable if I believe the other player. However, I can also bid a higher digit with the same quantity or a higher quantity with a lower or the same digit. Bidding 10 2s is a possible move as it increases the digit. However, given that the bid history shows a strong concentration on 1s and I have two 1s, it seems plausible that there could be a high count of 1s. Challenging seems risky. I will bid 10 2s as it's a safer move than challenging and still follows the rules of increasing the bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 10 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 2s. It seems unlikely that there are ten 2s in total, especially given the previous bidding history which focused on 1s. However, I don't have any 2s in my hand, and I don't want to bid higher on 2s. I could bid 11 0s or 11 of any other digit, but that would just be increasing the bid without any information. Given the high quantity already bid, a challenge seems more reasonable here.
