Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, which is a strong digit. Since there have been no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable bid. Bidding 2 8s is a good starting point, as it establishes a count based on my hand while being low enough to encourage further play.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. It's possible the opponent is bluffing. However, I can safely bid 3 0s, since I have two 0s in my hand, and it's likely there is at least one more 0 between the opponent's hand. This increases the quantity and changes the digit, making it a valid bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s and no 0s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s, which I believe is unlikely since I have no 0s. I should challenge this bid as it seems improbable that there are 3 0s among both hands.
