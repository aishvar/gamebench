Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid. I have one 8 and one 6 in my hand. Bidding 2 6s is a reasonable starting point, as it is likely that the other player has at least one 6.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 2 7s increases the digit value while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing digits to make a credible play.

Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and I have one 7, it's unlikely that there are more than 3 7s in total. However, I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a strong bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand has no 9s, so the opponent must have at least 3. However, with only 8 digits in their hand, having 3 9s is statistically unlikely (only 3.8% chance under random distribution). Challenging is a high-risk, high-reward play with a high probability of success given my lack of 9s and the bid's improbability.
