--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have the digits 2, 7, and 9 in my hand. Given that the current bid is None, I can make a bid that is likely to be valid. Bidding 3 9s seems reasonable, as I have one 9 in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 30364626, I have no 9s at all. Since there are 8 digits in Player 0's hand, for their bid of 3 9s to be valid, they must have at least 3 nines themselves. Having 3 or more of a single digit in 8 digits is somewhat rare but possible. However, given that I have zero 9s, I find it unlikely that there are 3 or more total. Therefore, challenging is a strong move here.
