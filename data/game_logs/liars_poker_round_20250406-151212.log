Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s and two 9s, which are strong candidates. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I will start with 2 1s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I can see my hand: 63307704. I have no 1s. The bid implies there are at least two 1s across both hands. Since I don't have any 1s, it means Player 0 must have at least two 1s. I can either challenge this bid or make a higher bid. A higher bid could be either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. I have a 3 and a 4, and a 6 and a 7, and a 0. I can bid on 0s or higher digits. Bidding 2 2s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit, and there's a good chance there are at least two 2s across both hands.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 95011926, I have two 1s and one 2. The current bid is 2 2s. Since I see one 2 myself, it's quite plausible there are at least two 2s total, so challenging now is risky. To outbid, I can either bid 2 3s (same quantity, higher digit) or increase quantity. I don't have any 3s, so raising digit isn't supported by my hand. Alternatively, I can bid 3 1s, since I already hold two 1s, making it quite likely there are at least three 1s total across both hands. This is a safe and natural increase.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I need to bid higher, either by increasing the quantity or the digit. My hand is 63307704, which contains no 1s and no 2s. I have a 3, a 6, two 7s, and a 4. The count of 1s is likely to be low since I have none and Player 0 has already bid 3 1s. I will bid 3 2s, increasing the digit from 1 to 2 while keeping the quantity the same. This is a relatively safe bid as it doesn't commit me to a high quantity, and I can reassess after the next move.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 1s and one 2. The current bid is 3 2s. Given I only have one 2, for the bid to be true, my opponent would need at least two 2s. While it's possible, it's not highly probable. Alternatively, I could raise the bid to 3 3s or 4 1s. Since I have two 1s, a bid of 4 1s would require my opponent to have at least two 1s, which is somewhat plausible. To maintain pressure and avoid challenging too early, I'll raise the quantity on a digit I have multiple of.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. The total count of 1s across both hands must be at least 4, which seems unlikely given I have none. However, I should consider the bid history and my own hand. I've seen a back-and-forth between 1s and 2s, suggesting the other player might have a decent number of 1s or is bluffing. My hand is 63307704, with no 1s but a good distribution of other numbers. Bidding 4 2s is a safe increase as it matches the quantity but increases the digit. However, considering the history, a more aggressive or slightly higher bid might be warranted if I had more of a digit to back it up. Since I have multiple 3s and 7s, and no 1s or 2s, I could consider bidding on a higher digit. Bidding 5 3s seems plausible because it increases the quantity and I'm bidding on a digit I have. However, I should be cautious not to overbid. Given the information, a reasonable next step is to bid 4 2s as it's a minimal increase and tests the opponent's hand without committing too much.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (95011926), I have one '2' and two '1's. The current bid is 4 2s, which would require the opponent to have at least three 2s. Given the distribution, it's unlikely the opponent holds three or more 2s, since I only have one. The probability of four or more 2s across both hands is quite low. Rather than making a risky higher bid, challenging is the optimal move.
