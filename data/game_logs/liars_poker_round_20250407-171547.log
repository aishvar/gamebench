Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since it's the first bid, I should make a reasonable opening bid. My hand contains two 7s, two 5s, one 6, one 1, one 2, and one 8. A safe starting bid would be to claim two 7s. I'll bid 2 7s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains no 7s (digits are 6,6,3,3,1,0,9,9). The current bid is 2 7s, meaning Player 0 claims there are at least two 7s total. Since I have zero 7s, for the bid to be valid, Player 0 must have both 7s in their hand, which is possible but somewhat unlikely given random distribution. Given that 7s are relatively rare in my hand (none), and the bid is modest (only 2), it's risky to challenge now. Instead, I will make a minimal higher bid to maintain pressure and gather more information. The next valid bid must be at least 2 8s or 3 of any digit. I have two 9s, so bidding 2 9s is safe and minimal.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. It's unlikely Player 1 has enough 9s to make that bid valid, considering my hand. Bidding higher would be risky as I have no 9s and could easily be challenged. Therefore, challenging seems like the best course of action.
