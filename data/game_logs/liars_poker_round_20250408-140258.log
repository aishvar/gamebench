Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning I can make any initial bid I want. I have a hand of 38450865, which contains two 5s and one 8. A reasonable initial bid could be based on the highest count of a digit in my hand. Since I have two 5s, bidding 2 5s seems like a good starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 5s. This means the other player would need at least 2 5s in their hand for the bid to be valid, which is plausible but not guaranteed. To avoid challenging too early and to keep the game progressing, I will make a higher bid. I have one 9 in my hand, and bidding 3 9s increases the quantity and changes the digit, making it a valid and reasonable move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than this. I have two 6s and two 5s in my hand. Bidding 4 5s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and I have evidence in my hand to support a higher bid.

Player 0 bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, which makes the current bid of 4 5s more suspicious. With 16 digits total across both players, Player 0 would need to have at least 4 5s to make their bid valid. This seems unlikely, especially since I have a diverse hand with no 5s. Given the bidding history, Player 0 has been focusing on 5s, which could be a bluff. I will challenge the bid.
