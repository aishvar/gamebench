Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 3s, two 4s, and other digits. I'll bid a small number of 3s to start.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3

Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. It's possible there are at least six 7s in total, but it's also plausible that the opponent is bluffing. Since the bid history shows a steady increase, I'll cautiously increase the bid to 7 7s. This is a small increase and allows me to stay in the game without making a huge leap.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 7 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. I have 2 7s in my hand, which is not enough to meet the current bid. I should try to increase the digit or quantity to make a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 7 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. It's possible there are at least seven 8s in total, but it's also possible the previous player is bluffing. I could bid 8 0s to increase the quantity and reset the digit to a lower number. However, 7 8s seems high enough to challenge, as there are only 16 total digits. I will challenge.
