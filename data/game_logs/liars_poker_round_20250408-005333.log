Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid in the game. Looking at my hand (80050464), I have: one 8, one 0, one 5, one 0, one 4, one 6, one 4. That's two 0s, two 4s, and one each of 5, 6, and 8. Since I have two 4s in my hand, I know there are at least two 4s in the game. This is a conservative but safe opening bid that's based on what I know for certain.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 18435112, I have no 4s, so the current bid of 2 4s depends entirely on my opponent's hand. Since it's quite plausible they have 2 or more 4s among their 8 digits, challenging would be risky. To safely continue, I will make a minimal but valid raise by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity, moving from 2 4s to 2 5s, since I have one 5 and it's a conservative escalation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (80050464), I have one 5 and one 4. The current bid is '2 5s', which means the opponent is claiming there are at least 2 fives total between our hands. Since I have one 5 in my hand, this is entirely possible - the opponent would only need to have one 5 as well for this bid to be valid. I could challenge, but it's a risky move since the bid is quite reasonable. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have two 0s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid '3 0s'. This is higher than '2 5s' because I'm increasing the quantity. Even if my opponent has no 0s, my two 0s make this a safer bid than challenging the current reasonable bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 18435112, I see no 0s at all. Given there are 16 digits total and I hold half, the opponent would need all 3 zeros in their hand for the current bid of 3 0s to be valid. This is unlikely, as having three of the same digit in 8 cards is rare. Therefore, it's a good opportunity to challenge this bid.
