Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. My hand contains the digits 9, 8, 5, 9, 6, 8, 1, and 7, with 9 and 8 appearing twice each. A reasonable opening bid would be 2 of a digit I have multiple times, such as 9 or 8. I choose to bid 2 of 9 because it is a safe and strategic opening bid, considering I have two 9s in my hand and it allows for flexibility in future bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 nines. Looking at my hand, 72508440, I have zero 9s. Since there are only 16 digits in total and I hold none of the 9s, that leaves all 2 nines (or more) to be entirely in Player 0's hand. While it's possible they have exactly 2 or more 9s, it's statistically unlikely for one hand to hold both 9s (probability decreases as the count increases). Given no evidence of 9s on my side and the relatively high bid early in the game, it's reasonable to challenge this bid rather than risk bidding higher on an unlikely scenario.
