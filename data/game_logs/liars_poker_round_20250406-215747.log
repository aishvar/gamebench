Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have one 9, one 8, one 6, and one 3 in my hand. Bidding 2 6s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 6.
