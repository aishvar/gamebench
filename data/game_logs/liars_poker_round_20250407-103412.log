Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 0s. The current bid is only 1 0s, so it's very likely there are more than one zero across both hands. Since I already have three, it's safe to confidently increase the bid to 3 0s, which is both truthful and a higher bid.

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 1s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 0s and zero 1s. The current bid is 3 1s, which requires there to be three or more 1s across both hands. Since I have zero 1s, the opponent would need to have all three or more 1s, which is unlikely given the distribution of digits. It's safer to challenge this bid rather than make a higher, riskier bid.
