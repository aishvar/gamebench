Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. My hand contains the digits 0, 8, 6, 7, 5, 9, 4, and 1, each appearing exactly once. A reasonable opening bid would be on a digit that appears in my hand and is likely to appear in the opponent's hand as well. Statistically, each digit has an equal probability of appearing in the opponent's hand, so I will start with a conservative bid of 1 for a digit in my hand. I will choose the digit '5' for no particular strategic reason other than it is as good as any other digit for an opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 five. Looking at my hand (21382560), I have exactly one 5. Since I hold one 5, and the opponent has 8 digits, it's highly probable there is at least one five total, making the current bid of 1 five quite safe. Challenging now would be risky and likely unsuccessful. The best move is to raise the bid. The minimal valid raise is either increasing the quantity to 2 of any digit (e.g., 2 0s) or bidding 1 with a higher digit (1 6s or above). In my hand, I have two 2s, so bidding 2 2s is a safe and strategic higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s, meaning Player 1 is claiming there are at least two '2s' across both hands. Looking at my hand (08675941), there are no '2s'. This means Player 1 must have at least two '2s' in their hand for their bid to be valid. Since each hand contains 8 digits, it's possible but not guaranteed that Player 1 has two '2s'. However, the probability of having exactly two '2s' in their hand is not exceptionally high, and based on the bid history, Player 1 might be bluffing to push the bid higher. I will challenge the bid, as I believe it is unlikely there are at least 2 '2s' across both hands.
