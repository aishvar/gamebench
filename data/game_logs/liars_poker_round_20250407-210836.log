Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I have the opportunity to start the bidding. My hand contains the digits 7, 1, 6, 9, 5, 8, 8, and 1. The digit '1' appears twice, and I can reasonably assume that there are at least a few more '1's in the other player's hand. Therefore, I will start with a bid of '2' for the digit '1'. This is a safe opening bid that reflects my hand while allowing room for higher bids in subsequent turns.
