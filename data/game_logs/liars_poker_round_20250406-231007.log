Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a low bid based on my hand. I have two 0s, two 6s, and two 7s. I will bid 2 0s to start.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 2 0s. Bidding 2 9s increases the digit while maintaining quantity, leveraging my strong hand in 9s. Since 9 is higher than 0, this is a valid higher bid, and even if the opponent has no 9s, the total count (2) matches my bid, making it safe.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Since the previous bid was 2 0s, and I have two 0s, I could bid 3 0s. However, a safer bid is to simply increase the quantity on the current bid. Bidding 3 9s is a valid and potentially less risky move than trying to bluff with the 0s.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, requiring at least three total. Since Player 0 raised to 3 9s after my 2 9s bid, they likely have at least one 9 (making the bid valid). Challenging risks losing if they have one. To stay safe, I'll bid 4 8s. I have two 8s, and if the opponent has two more (plausible given 8s are common), the total would meet the bid while avoiding immediate confrontation over the 9s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I don't have any 8s in my hand. Since the previous bids have been relatively low, and I don't have any information to suggest a high number of 8s, bidding higher seems risky. Challenging seems like the best option.
