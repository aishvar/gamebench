Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s, one 1, and one 0 in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I need to start the bidding. I can confidently bid 2 2s as I already have two of that digit, and it's a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand does not contain any 2s, so the current bid of 2 2s relies entirely on my opponent's 8 unknown digits. The chance that the opponent has at least two 2s in 8 digits is roughly 19%, meaning there's an 81% chance the bid is false. Given this high probability to catch the bluff, challenging the bid is the best move.
