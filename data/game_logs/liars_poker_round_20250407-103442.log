Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s ('8 0 0 3 6 7 1 8'). Since the current bid is only 1 0s, I know there are already at least 2 zeros, making it safe to confidently raise the bid. The next strictly higher bid would be 2 0s, which is fully supported by my hand alone. Therefore, I will bid 2 0s.
