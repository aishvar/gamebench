Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to set a plausible opening bid. I have one 5 in my hand. Given there are 16 total digits (8 per player), there's a reasonable chance the opponent has at least one 5, making a total of 2. Starting with '2 5s' is conservative yet strategic, leveraging my own card while keeping the bid low enough to avoid immediate risk.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 and one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s. Since I only have one 5, I don't have enough information to confidently increase the quantity of 5s. However, I can try to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, considering my 6. Bidding 2 6s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit and I have one 6 in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s, requiring at least one more 6 from the opponent. Challenging risks losing if they have even one 6. A safer move is to bid 2 9s: I have one 9, and there's a ~57% chance the opponent has at least one 9 in their 8-digit hand, making the bid valid while increasing the digit.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 2 9s, I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Since my hand is 18716952, I have no 9s. However, I can try to bid a higher quantity of a lower digit or the same quantity of a higher digit. Considering the digits I have, bidding a higher quantity of a digit I possess could be strategic. Noticing I have two 6s and a couple of other digits repeated, but no 9s, I must decide if challenging the 2 9s bid is more likely to succeed or if I should bid higher. Given the information and aiming to increase the bid while making an educated guess, I should consider what digits are likely to appear more than twice across both hands. Since I don't have any 9s and the bid is already at 2 9s, which might be plausible given the other player could have them, I'll aim to increase the bid by considering other digits that could plausibly occur more frequently. However, without direct evidence or a clear strategy to outbid safely, challenging seems risky without a strong basis. Thus, considering a strategic move, I must weigh the odds of success in challenging versus making a potentially risky bid. Given the current state and the fact that I don't have a strong basis to safely outbid without more information, and considering the rules that allow for a challenge, the safest move might be to challenge the current bid if it seems unlikely, but since I don't have enough information to confidently say 2 9s is unlikely (as the other player could have them), I must think of a strategic bid that could potentially be safe or challenge if the bid seems improbable. Given these considerations and aiming for a strategic approach, I should look at the digits I have and consider if any could be bid higher in quantity or if the same quantity of a higher digit could be a viable option. However, the absence of 9s in my hand and the need to strictly increase the bid suggests I should either find a higher digit with the same quantity or increase the quantity of a digit I think might be more common. Since challenging directly might not be the best without more insight into the other player's hand, and given the need for a strategic move that adheres to the game's rules, I will consider the possibility of outbidding by looking at my hand's composition and the bids made so far.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 2 9s and considering I have no 9s in my hand (18716952), to make a higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. However, since 9 is the highest digit, my only option to bid higher is to increase the quantity. Thus, bidding 3 9s seems like a reasonable move, as it increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same, which is the highest possible digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand has one 9. Player 1 bid 3 9s, implying they might have two 9s (total 3). Challenging risks losing if they indeed have two. To avoid immediate risk, I bid 4 0s, increasing the quantity while bluffing on a digit not in my hand. This forces Player 1 to either challenge or bid higher, shifting pressure back to them.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 0s' and looking at my hand '18716952', I notice I have one '0'. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and we are already at a bid of 4, increasing the quantity further might be risky without more information. However, considering the bidding history and the fact that '0' is not a commonly high-bid digit, I could consider challenging this bid or making a strategic bid. Given that my hand does not offer a clear advantage for bidding higher on '0s' and considering the risk of challenging, a safer approach might be to bid on a different digit that I have in abundance or seems plausible based on the history. Since I have two '1's and one '6' and '9', and given the history of bids, bidding on '1's could be a viable option as it's a new digit and doesn't directly compete with the current '0s' bid. Bidding '5 1s' seems like a reasonable move, considering I have two '1's and it's possible the other player might have a few '1's as well, given the distribution of digits.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand. The opponent bid 5 1s, requiring at least four 1s in their hand. Given the bid history and the risk of them bluffing, challenging seems prudent as their 1 count might be lower than claimed.
