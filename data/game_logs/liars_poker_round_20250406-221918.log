Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand, which is my strongest digit count. With no current bid and 8 unknown digits in my opponentâ€™s hand, bidding '3 4s' is logical since I can at least guarantee the three 4s I hold, and it's likely the opponent could have additional 4s. This conservative opening bid sets a strong foundation for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. I could bid 3 5s, but I have two 6s and two 9s. I'll bid 4 6s, increasing both the quantity and the digit, and leveraging my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no sixes in my hand, so the current bid of 4 6s relies entirely on the opponent's hand. With the opponent holding 8 random digits, the probability that they have 4 or more sixes is extremely low (approximately 0.5%). Therefore, the current bid appears very unlikely to be true, and I should challenge.
