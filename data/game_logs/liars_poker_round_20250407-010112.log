Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. I have 8 digits: 7, 1, 6, 4, 3, 4, 8, 2. The most frequent digit in my hand is 4, appearing twice. The total number of digits in play is 16 (2 players * 8 digits). Statistically, each digit is expected to appear 1.6 times. Since I already have two 4s, bidding '2 4s' is a very safe opening bid. It's highly likely to be true (the opponent only needs zero 4s), and it forces the opponent to make a higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (65879586), I don't have any 4s. The current bid is quite low at '2 4s', and with 16 total digits in play, it's likely there are at least 2 4s between both hands. Since I have three 5s in my hand, I can confidently bid '3 5s', which is valid as it increases both the quantity and the digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have zero 5s in my hand (71643482). For the bid to be true, Player 1 must have at least three 5s. While possible, I can make a stronger bid based on my own hand. I have two 4s. Bidding 4 4s is a higher bid (increasing the quantity). This bid requires a total of four 4s across both hands. Since I hold two, Player 1 only needs to hold two 4s, which is plausible. This bid leverages my strongest digit and puts pressure back on Player 1.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I see my hand (65879586) contains no 4s. The opponent bid 4 4s, which means they would need at least 4 4s in their hand since I have none. While possible, this seems unlikely given they started with a lower bid of 2 4s. Also, their initial bid of 2 4s suggests they probably have 1-2 4s, not 4. Given this analysis and having zero 4s myself, I should challenge.
