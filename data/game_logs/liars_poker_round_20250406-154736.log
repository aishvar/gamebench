Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 8.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 3, 4, 0, 2, 2, 5, 4, 0. I have zero 8s, so the current bid of 3 8s relies entirely on the opponent holding at least 3 of them, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. Since the total maximum 8s is 16, but the probability of one player holding 3 or more 8s without me having any is quite low. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
