--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 8s, one 9, one 5, one 6, and one 2. A safe and strategic opening bid is to pick a digit I have multiple of, such as 8 or 0. I'll start with '2 8s' since I hold two 8s myself, making it likely there are at least two or more in total, and it sets a solid but not overly aggressive opening.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s and one 9. The current bid is 2 9s, which means the opponent claims there are at least two 9s in total. Since I only have one 9, for their bid to be valid, they must have at least one or two 9s. This is plausible, so challenging now is risky. To outbid, I can increase the quantity or the digit. The next minimal higher bid is 2 9s -> 3 0s (since 3 is a higher quantity). I have two 0s, so needing only one more zero in the opponent's hand to make 3 total is quite probable. Therefore, bidding 3 0s is a safe and strategic move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 1 (Naive 50/50)
Player 1 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 1s
Player 1 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 0s and two 8s, but no 1s. The current bid is 3 1s. Since I hold no 1s, the likelihood that there are at least three 1s across both hands depends entirely on Player 1 having all three or more, which is improbable. Given the low probability, the best move is to challenge the bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 1's (Naive 50/50) bid of 3 1s.
