Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 7s, two 3s, one 1, one 9, and one 8. A safe opening bid is typically 2 of a digit I have multiple of. I'll start with 2 7s because I have two 7s, making it a conservative but solid opening bid.
