Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 3 of 3s is a common starting move in Liar's Poker. It balances plausibility (opponent might have 1-2 3s, making total 3-4) while allowing future bids to escalate quantity or switch to a higher digit. Starting with a mid-digit (3) avoids overcommitting to high digits (like 9) where I have fewer cards.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. Looking at my hand (02658636), I have two 3s. To satisfy the bid, the opponent would need at least one 3 in their hand, which is quite plausible. Since 3 3s is reasonable, challenging now is risky. The next valid bid must be either 4 of any digit, or 3 of a digit higher than 3 (i.e., 3 4s or higher). In my hand, I have two 6s, two 3s, and one 8, making 6s a strong candidate. Since I already have two 6s, bidding 3 6s is safe, but it is not a valid bid because it's not higher than 3 3s in quantity, only in digit, which is allowed. Therefore, I can safely bid 3 6s as it is a higher digit with the same quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. Your hand has 0 6s, so the total number of 6s depends on the opponent's hand. Since the bid requires at least 3, and you have none, it's possible the opponent has 3 or fewer. Challenging risks losing if they have exactly 3, but there's a chance they overbid. Bidding higher (e.g., 3 7s or 4 6s) is risky without evidence. Challenging is the most aggressive play given your lack of 6s.
