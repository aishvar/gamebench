Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand 92948033, I have two 9s, two 3s, one 8, one 4, one 2, and one 0. The most common digits in my hand are 9 and 3, each appearing twice. Opening with a conservative but solid bid of 2 9s leverages my strong count of 9s and sets a reasonable bar for the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '2 9s' and examining my hand '70261848', I notice I don't have any 9s. Since I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than '2 9s', I must consider either increasing the quantity of 9s, which seems risky without having any 9s in my hand, or bidding on a higher digit with the same or higher quantity. However, without knowing the distribution of digits in the other player's hand, any bid involving a higher digit than 9 is not possible since 9 is the highest digit. Thus, my safest option to ensure a higher bid is to increase the quantity of the digit 9, despite not having any in my hand, hoping the other player also doesn't have enough to meet the bid, or to challenge if I think the current bid is unlikely. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and considering the risk, a more strategic move might be to challenge the current bid if it seems implausible, but since I have no information suggesting '2 9s' is implausible and I must bid higher, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same seems like the logical step.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which is plausible if the opponent has at least one 9. Since I have two, it's risky to challenge now. A safe and strategic move is to increase the quantity to 4 9s, as that is still within the realm of possibility given my hand and a reasonable assumption that the opponent might have two or more 9s in total.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 9s' and my hand '70261848', I notice I don't have any 9s. However, to make a valid bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since the current bid is already on the highest digit (9), my only option to bid higher is to increase the quantity, which would be '5 9s'. However, without knowing the other player's hand and considering the risk, challenging seems like a viable option, especially since I have no 9s and the bid is already quite high. Challenging the bid '4 9s' might be a good strategy if I believe the total number of 9s across both hands is less than 4, which is possible given my hand has no 9s.
