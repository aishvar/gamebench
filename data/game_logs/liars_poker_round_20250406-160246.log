Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 8, and one 9. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 of a middle digit. I notice I have one 8 and one 9, so bidding 2 8s is a conservative yet non-trivial opening bid that leaves room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 89684127, which contains two 8s. The current bid is 2 8s. Challenging this bid is guaranteed to lose, as my hand alone satisfies the bid quantity (2 >= 2). I must make a higher bid. Options are 2 9s or any bid with quantity 3 or more. Since I have two 8s, bidding 3 8s is a well-supported bid, only requiring the opponent (who initiated bidding on 8s) to have at least one 8. This seems more likely and strategically sound than switching to 2 9s (where I only have one 9) or bidding 3 of another digit where I only hold one.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. The current bid is 3 8s, so for it to be valid, there must be at least two more 8s in the opponent's hand. Since each player has 8 digits, the chance of the opponent having two or more 8s is relatively low but possible. However, it's not improbable enough to confidently challenge now. Instead, I can make a minimal higher bid by raising the digit to 3 9s, since I also have one 9, which keeps the pressure on without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 89684127. The current bid is 3 9s, made by Player 0. I have one 9 in my hand. For the bid to be true, Player 0 must have at least two 9s among their 8 digits. Player 0 previously bid 2 8s, I bid 3 8s (I have two 8s), and then Player 0 switched to 3 9s instead of challenging or bidding higher on 8s. This switch away from 8s after I showed strength could indicate they don't have many 8s, and potentially suggests their 3 9s bid might also be weak or a bluff. While Player 0 having two 9s is possible, it's not guaranteed. Given the bidding history and the moderate quantity of the bid, challenging seems like a reasonable strategic move to test Player 0's claim.
