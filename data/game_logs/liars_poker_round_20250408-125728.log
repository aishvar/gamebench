Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s, making it reasonable to start the bidding conservatively. I will bid 2 9s as this is safe and aligns directly with my own hand, leaving room to assess the opponent's response.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (86902138). For the current bid to be true, the opponent needs at least one 9, which is plausible. Challenging seems risky because it's a low bid. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity). This bid is well-supported by my hand, as I only need the opponent to have one 8 out of their 8 digits for the bid to be true, which is statistically likely. This puts pressure back on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one '8' in my hand. The opponent bid '3 8s', meaning they likely have at least one or two '8s'. Given that there are 16 digits in total and I have only one '8', it's plausible that at least three '8s' exist overall. However, I also have two '9s' in my hand. Previously, I bid '2 9s', which is easily supported by my own hand alone. Increasing the bid to '3 9s' seems safer because I already have two '9s', and it's reasonable to assume at least one more '9' could exist in my opponent's hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (86902138). For the bid to be true, the opponent needs at least two 9s out of their 8 digits. While not guaranteed, this is plausible, especially since they opened the bidding with 2 9s. Challenging feels risky. My hand contains two 8s. My previous bid was 3 8s. Bidding 4 8s is a natural progression, leverages my strong holding of 8s, and requires the opponent to have at least two 8s, which is reasonably likely (2 out of 8 digits). This seems safer than challenging the 3 9s bid and puts the pressure back on the opponent.

Player 1 bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have exactly one '8' in my hand. The current bid is 4 '8s', meaning Player 1 claims there are at least three additional '8s' in their hand. With only 16 digits total, it's plausible but risky. However, the bidding history shows Player 1 increased the bid from 3 '8s' to 4 '8s', indicating confidence in having multiple '8s'. Given that I only have one '8', and the opponent seems confident, it's risky but still plausible they have at least three. To avoid a risky challenge, I will instead make a safer higher bid. I have two '9s', so bidding 4 '9s' is reasonable because I already hold half the required digits, making it a safer and strategic bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I hold one '9' (86902138). The current bid is 4 9s, meaning Player 0 claims there are at least four 9s in total across both hands (16 digits). For this to be true, Player 0 must hold at least three 9s in their 8-digit hand. Player 0 has escalated bids on 9s (2 9s -> 3 9s -> 4 9s), indicating they likely hold at least two 9s. However, requiring three specific digits in an 8-digit hand is statistically improbable, making it more likely they hold two 9s and are bluffing the fourth 9. Making a higher bid, such as 5 8s (based on my two 8s), seems risky as Player 0 previously ignored my 4 8s bid by bidding 4 9s, suggesting they may not hold many 8s or are very confident in their 9s. Given the unlikelihood of Player 0 holding three 9s compared to the possibility of a bluff based on holding two 9s, challenging is the most prudent action.
