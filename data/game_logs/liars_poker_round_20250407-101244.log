Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It is the first bid of the game, so I need to start with a reasonable opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 7s, two 3s, one 4, and one 2. Since I have two 8s, a safe and strong opening bid would be 3 8s, assuming the opponent likely has at least one 8 among their eight digits, making the total at least three plausible.
