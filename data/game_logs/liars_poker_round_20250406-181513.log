Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a diverse hand with digits 6, 1, 9, 7, 6, and 2. The current bid is None, so I should make a reasonable initial bid. Given the diversity of my hand, I'll focus on a digit that appears frequently. The digit '6' appears twice in my hand, which is a significant portion. I'll make a bid with a high quantity and a digit that is likely to appear frequently in other players' hands as well. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have 6s in my hand, so I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit. I'll bid 4 8s, as it's a valid higher bid compared to 4 7s.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 1 (Naive 50/50)
Player 1 (Naive) chose to BID: 4 9s
Player 1 (Naive 50/50) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have a 9 in my hand, but I also have a 6. Since the previous bid was 4 8s and I have a 6, which is higher than 8, I should increase the digit to 9, but I don't have enough information to increase the quantity. I should bid a higher digit, but the current bid is already high. I should challenge the current bid because it seems unlikely that there are at least 4 9s in total.
