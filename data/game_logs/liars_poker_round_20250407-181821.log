Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand '34263574', the digit counts are: 3 (2), 4 (2), 2 (1), 6 (1), 5 (1), 7 (1). The most frequent digits in my hand are 3 and 4, each appearing twice. A sensible opening bid is to call 2 of one of these digits, as it's likely the opponent has at least one more of that digit, making the total 3 or more plausible. I'll choose digit 3 for the first bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Let me analyze my hand and the current bid of '2 3s'. In my hand of 18173519, I have 1 three. Since there are 16 total digits in play (8 per player), and I can see my 8 digits with only 1 three, there would need to be at least 1 more three in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. This is quite possible given that I can't see their hand. I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. Since I have multiple 5s in my hand, I can confidently bid '2 5s' which maintains the same quantity but uses a higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 34263574, which contains one '5'. The current bid is 2 fives, so for it to be valid, Player 1 must have at least one five, which is plausible. Since 2 fives is quite reasonable with 16 digits total, challenging now is risky. To continue, I can raise the bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, for example to 2 sixes, since I have two sixes in my hand, making it a safe incremental bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I can see my entire hand of '18173519' which contains no 6s. The opponent bid '2 6s', claiming there are at least 2 sixes total between both hands. Since I have zero 6s in my hand, this would mean the opponent would need to have at least 2 sixes in their hand of 8 digits. While possible, having 2 or more of any specific digit in 8 random digits is relatively unlikely (around 28% chance). Given I can see no 6s in my hand and the probability analysis, challenging is the safer move than making a higher bid.
