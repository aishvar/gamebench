Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 8 digits in my hand, but I don't know the distribution. The current bid is None, so I should start by bidding on a commonly occurring digit. I notice that my hand contains a 5, so I'll bid on a quantity of 5s, which is a reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand (61239144) contains two 1s, which guarantees that there are at least two 1s in play. The current bid is 1 5s, and since any bid with a higher quantity is valid, I can safely raise the bid to '2 1s'. This move leverages my known holding while forcing my opponent to either bid higher or challenge in a situation where I know I have a secure minimum.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is only 2 1s, which is unlikely. Given the low quantity, I should bid on a higher digit to increase the chances of winning. Bidding 1 5s seems reasonable, as I have one 5 in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I examined my hand (61239144) and noticed that I have no 5s. The current bid is 3 5s, which means all three 5s would have to come from the opponent’s 8-digit hand—a highly unlikely event (roughly a 4% chance based on binomial probabilities). Since there is little evidence to support the bid, challenging is the optimal move.
