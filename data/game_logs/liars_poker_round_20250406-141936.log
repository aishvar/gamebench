Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, one 6, one 7, one 8, one 0, and two 9s. The most promising digits are 3 and 9, each appearing twice. An opening bid of 3 3s would be conservative, but since I hold two 3s, and there are 24 other digits in play, it's likely there are at least three 3s total. Therefore, I will open with a safe and reasonable bid of 3 3s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 2, 8, 1, 5, 4, 6, 4, 4, I can see if I can make a reasonable bid based on my digits. I have two 4s and two 6s, but no 3s or higher quantity of 3s. I can try to bid higher with a digit I have. The bid of 3 3s seems low, but I should try to increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 4s and two 6s, so bidding 4 4s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I need to make a bid that is higher. My hand is 74130629, which contains one 4. I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 8 players and each has 8 digits, the total number of digits is 32. The maximum number of 4s possible is 32. Bidding 5 4s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity, but it might be too aggressive. Alternatively, bidding 4 5s is also a valid option as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit. Given that I have no information about other players' hands, I'll play cautiously and bid 4 5s.

--- Turn: Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one '5' in my hand. The current bid is '4 5s'. Given that there are 4 players with 8 digits each, the total possible digits are 32. The bid of 4 '5s' is relatively low, but since I only have one, it's possible that the other players have the remaining three. However, increasing the bid to '4 6s' or '5 0s' would be a safer move, as I have one '6' and two '0s' in my hand. Bidding '4 6s' increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (16780339), I have one 6. The current bid is 4 6s, which means there must be at least three more 6s among the other 24 digits. This is plausible, so challenging now would be risky. A safe higher bid would be 4 7s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a minimal raise and strategically sound.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I need to make a higher bid. Since my hand contains two 6s, I can confidently bid on a digit that is higher than 7 or increase the quantity. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32, and with 8 digits per player, there could be many 7s. However, bidding a higher digit with a low quantity seems reasonable. I have two 6s and can try to bid higher on a different digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (74130629), so I know there are at least one 8. The total number of 8s across all players is likely to be more than 5 because the previous bids have been steadily increasing in digit. However, bidding too high might risk being challenged. I can either challenge or make a slightly higher bid. Since I have no information about other players' hands and the current bid is not extremely high, I'll make a higher bid. Bidding 5 9s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit, making it harder for others to know my hand, and the quantity remains the same.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 9s

--- Turn: Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand (20121357). With 4 players and 8 digits each, there are 32 digits in total. The bid of 5 9s is relatively high, especially since 9 is the highest digit and less likely to appear frequently. Given that I have none, it's plausible that the total count is less than 5. Therefore, challenging seems like the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) challenges Player 2's (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bid of 5 9s.
