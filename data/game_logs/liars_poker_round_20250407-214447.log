Player 0 Reasoning: As Player 0, I am making the first bid. My hand is 61253745. I have two 5s, which is the highest count of any single digit in my hand. Since there are 16 digits in total (8 per player), the expected count for any digit is 1.6. Bidding '2 5' is a safe opening move because I hold exactly two 5s, meaning the bid is true based solely on my hand, regardless of the opponent's digits. This forces the opponent to make a higher bid or challenge a bid that is already confirmed by my own cards.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 fives. Looking at my hand (90128862), I see zero 5s. Since I have no 5s, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have both 5s in their hand, which is possible but somewhat unlikely. However, it's still early in bidding, and 2 of any digit is a very conservative bid, so challenging now is risky. Instead, I can safely increase the bid with a digit I have multiple of. I have two 8s and two 2s. Bidding 3 2s or 3 8s would be a significant jump, but a minimal safe increase is to bid 2 6s, since I have one 6, and it's plausible the opponent has at least one. Alternatively, I can bid 2 8s, since I have two. But since 2 5s is the current bid, the minimal higher bid would be 2 6s (higher digit, same quantity). This is a safe incremental bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 6s'. I have one 6 in my hand (61253745). For the bid to be true, the opponent needs at least one 6 in their 8-digit hand, which is statistically plausible (expected value is 0.8). Challenging seems risky.

I need to make a higher bid. Options are increasing the quantity (to 3) or keeping the quantity at 2 and increasing the digit (to 7, 8, or 9).

Let's consider bids:
- '2 7s': I have one 7. Requires opponent to have >=1 seven. Plausible.
- '3 0s' to '3 4s', '3 6s', '3 7s': I have one of each (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7). Requires opponent to have >=2 of that digit. Less likely than bids based on my stronger digits.
- '3 5s': I have two 5s. This bid requires the opponent to have at least one 5 in their hand. Given I hold two 5s already, claiming a total of three is a strong, credible bid based on my hand. This seems much safer and more likely to be true than challenging '2 6s' or bidding on digits I only have one of.

Therefore, bidding '3 5s' is the best strategic move.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits: 9, 0, 1, 2, 8, 8, 6, 2. I have zero 5s in my hand. The opponent has bid 3 5s, implying there are at least 3 fives across both hands. Since I have none, all 3 would need to be in their hand, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. Typically, having 3 of any digit in 8 digits is somewhat rare (~10% chance), so the probability the total is at least 3 is low. Therefore, challenging is strategically sound. Alternatively, bidding 3 6s (since I have one 6) or 4 of any digit would be risky without more evidence. The best move is to challenge.
