Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening move and there is no current bid, I want to make a safe but credible initial bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 8, so all digits occur once. Statistically, with 16 total digits, the average count of any digit is about 1.6. A conservative and reasonable opening bid is 2 of a mid-value digit I possess. I'll choose 2 3s as my starting bid.
