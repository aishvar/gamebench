Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. Since the current bid is 1 0s, I know there are at least two 0s total, making a higher bid on 0s safe. The next valid bid would be 2 0s, which is supported by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s ('0', '0') and one 1 ('1'). The current bid is 2 1s, and since I hold 1 of those, it's quite possible the opponent has at least 1 more, making the bid plausible. To increase the bid, I can leverage my two 0s and bid 3 0s, which is a reasonable next step supported by my hand. This is a strictly higher bid both in quantity and because 3 0s is a higher quantity than 2 1s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 1s and two 0s. The current bid is 3 1s, so combined with my two 1s, Player 0 would need to have at least one more 1 to make the bid valid. This is plausible, but risky to challenge now. A safe and strategic move is to increase the bid slightly to maintain pressure. Since I have two 0s, and previous bids showed Player 0 willing to bid on 0s, I can reasonably bid 3 2s (next higher digit at same quantity) or increase quantity. I will bid 3 2s as a conservative incremental raise.
