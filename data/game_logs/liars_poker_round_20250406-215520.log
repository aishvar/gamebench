Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s, which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least two 7s in total across both hands. Since I have none, it's unlikely Player 0 has two 7s unless they are bluffing. Challenging seems like the best move.
