Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 38756102, which contains a variety of digits. I see that I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 8. To start, I should bid on a digit that I have and try to be somewhat conservative. I have multiple digits appearing once, so bidding on any of them seems reasonable. I'll start with '2 1s' as it's a relatively safe bid, indicating there are at least two 1s in total across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 12586943, I have zero 1s. Since the current bid is 2 1s, that would mean the opponent must have at least two 1s for the bid to be valid. Given each player has eight digits, it's somewhat plausible but not guaranteed. Making a minimal safe raise is better than challenging now, as the bid is conservative and likely true. I will increase the quantity to 2 but choose a higher digit where I have some presence. I have one 2, so bidding 2 2s is a minimal legal raise and safer.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have one 2 in my hand, so the total count of 2s is at least 1. The bid of 2 2s is quite low considering the total number of digits is 16. I can bid higher. I have a 7 and a 6, and it's possible the other player has some as well. Bidding 3 6s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases both the quantity and the digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 1, 2, 5, 8, 6, 9, 4, 3, which includes exactly one 6. The current bid is 3 6s, meaning there need to be at least two 6s in the opponent's hand. Since each player has 8 digits, it is plausible the opponent holds two or more 6s, but not guaranteed. However, a bid of 3 6s is quite reasonable statistically, so challenging now would be risky. To maintain pressure, the minimal valid higher bid is 3 7s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is safer than jumping to 4 6s without strong evidence. Therefore, I will bid 3 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I see one 7, it's plausible there are more. I can bid 3 8s, keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. The current bid is 3 8s, which means there must be at least two more 8s in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. Since each player has 8 digits, the probability that Player 0 has two or more 8s is relatively low. Additionally, the previous bids increased sequentially, indicating Player 0 might be bluffing or pushing the bid higher without strong evidence. Given the low likelihood of there being three or more 8s in total, challenging is the optimal move.
