Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, one 7, one 6, one 5, one 3, two 2s, and one 9. A safe opening bid would reflect a digit I have at least two of, to increase the likelihood of the initial bid being valid. Therefore, I will open with '2 0s', which is conservative and based on my hand.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have one 0 in my hand (87653819), so the total count of 0s is at least 1. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about other digits, I'll increase the quantity. Bidding 3 0s seems reasonable as it is a higher quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s. The current bid is 3 0s, which means there must be at least one more 0 in the opponent's hand to meet the bid. This is plausible, as the opponent could have one or more 0s. Since challenging now carries a risk, I will instead increase the bid conservatively. I don't have many of any other digit, but I have two 2s, so bidding 3 2s is a safe minimal raise (same quantity, higher digit).
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 2S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have a lot of high digits, I'll consider increasing the digit. I have multiple digits that could be considered for a bid, but I'll focus on a relatively safe increase. Bidding 3 3s seems reasonable as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 3S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 9. The current bid is 3 3s. Since I only have one 3, for the bid to be valid the opponent would need at least two 3s. While possible, it's not extremely likely. To continue the game strategically, I can make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit but keeping the quantity, such as 3 5s, because I hold one 5 and it's plausible there are two more in the opponent's hand. This keeps pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. My hand is 87653819, which contains one 5 and one 3. I have a reasonable count of 3s and a decent count of higher digits. The current bid of 3 5s is not extremely high. I can bid higher by increasing the digit. Since I see one 5 in my hand, it's possible there are at least three 5s in total. I will bid 3 6s, increasing the digit to make a higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6. The current bid is 3 6s, which means there must be at least two 6s in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. Since each player only has 8 digits, having two or more 6s in one hand is possible but not highly probable. However, it's not unlikely enough to confidently challenge yet. Instead, I can increase the bid safely by moving to 3 7s, as I also have one 7, making that a plausible incremental bid without increasing quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. My hand is 87653819, which contains one 7 and one 8. I can see that increasing the digit is a viable option. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable move as it is a higher digit than 7 and I have at least one 8 in my hand, making it more likely that the total count could be 3 or more.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains one 0, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 7, one 9, and one additional 0. Notably, I have no 8s, making the current bid of 3 8s suspicious. Since I have zero 8s, all three would need to be in my opponent's hand, which is unlikely given typical distribution. The opponent has been incrementally increasing the digit without raising the quantity, possibly bluffing. With zero 8s on my side, it's a good spot to challenge.
