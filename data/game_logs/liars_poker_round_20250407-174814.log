Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two zeros in my hand, making it a safe choice to bid on the digit 0 with a quantity of 2. This ensures that the bid is valid since there are at least two zeros in the game. Bidding on a digit I possess allows me to control the bid's validity, reducing the risk of an unsuccessful challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 60176379. The current bid is '2 0s' made by Player 0. I have one '0' in my hand. For the bid '2 0s' to be false, Player 0 must have zero '0's. Challenging seems risky early on, as it's plausible Player 0 has at least one '0'. I need to make a bid higher than '2 0s'. I have two '6's and two '7's in my hand. Bidding '2 6s' is higher than '2 0s' (same quantity, higher digit). Since I hold two '6's myself, this bid is guaranteed to be true based on my hand alone, making it a safe bid that cannot be successfully challenged. This forces Player 0 to make a higher bid.

Player 0 response was not valid JSON: 'The current bid is 2 sixes by Player 1. I have no sixes in my hand, so the total sixes depend on Player 1's hand. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Since I have a nine, I can safely bid 1 nine, which is a higher digit than six, making it a valid move without risking a challenge.

Player 0 response was not valid JSON: 'The current bid is 2 sixes. I have no sixes, so the total depends on Player 1's hand. If they have at least two, the bid is valid; otherwise, it's a bluff. Challenging is the best move as I can't make a higher bid and suspect a bluff.

{
  "reasoning": "I have no sixes in my hand, so the total number of sixes depends on Player 1's hand. If Player 1 has at least two sixes, the bid is valid. If not, the bid is a bluff. Since I cannot make a higher bid, challenging is the optimal move to test the validity of the bid.",

Player 0 response was not valid JSON: 'The current bid is 2 6s. I have no 6s in my hand, so the bid's validity depends entirely on Player 1 having exactly two 6s. Given the uncertainty and the risk of overbidding without sufficient information, challenging is the optimal choice.
