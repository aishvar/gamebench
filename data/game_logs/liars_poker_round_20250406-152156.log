Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 5s, two 8s, one 7, and one 4. A conservative and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, as I hold two 5s myself, making it plausible or even likely there are at least two 5s total.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. Looking at my hand (89910166), I see that I have one 6, no 5s. The bid implies there are at least two 5s in total across both hands. Since I don't have any 5s, Player 0 must have bid based on having at least two 5s or bluffing. I have two 6s, so bidding 3 6s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases both the quantity and the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s (digits: 7,5,3,5,6,3,8,4). The current bid is 3 6s, which is plausible since I already hold two 6s, so it is likely that there is at least one more 6 in the opponent's hand. Given this, challenging now would be risky. The safest move is to increase the bid slightly. I will bid 3 7s, which is a valid strictly higher bid (same quantity, higher digit), and I have one 7 in my hand, making it somewhat plausible.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (since my hand is 89910166). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. I see that I have multiple 8s and 6s, and 9s. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable because it increases the digit and I have information about having at least one 8. Alternatively, I could bid 4 of a digit I have more confidence in or have more of. Since I have two 6s, bidding 4 6s is also viable as it increases the quantity. However, given that I have two 8s and 9s, and the current bid is 3 7s, bidding 3 8s or 3 9s are both valid options that are higher than 3 7s. I will choose to bid 3 8s as it's a relatively safe increase.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s. Since the current bid is 3 8s, it would require my opponent to have at least one 8 for the bid to be valid. Given that distribution, 3 8s is plausible but not guaranteed. Making a higher bid of 4 8s would be risky because that would require my opponent to have at least two 8s, which is unlikely. Alternatively, I could increase the digit at the same quantity. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s as well, so bidding 3 9s would be riskier, but 4 5s or 4 6s could be safer since I have two 5s and one 6. Bidding 4 5s seems reasonable as I have two 5s, and it's likely there are at least two more 5s in total. Therefore, I will raise the quantity and switch the digit to 5s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I can see my own hand: 89910166. I have one 5 (actually, none, but there's a possibility the other player has some), but more importantly, I have two 8s and two 6s. The last bid was 3 8s by me, and before that, it was 3 7s. The bid of 4 5s seems somewhat arbitrary given the previous bids were on higher digits. I need to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. To bid higher than 4 5s, I can either bid 5 or more of any digit or bid 4 of a digit higher than 5. Given my hand, I can reasonably suspect there might be more 8s or 6s. However, bidding 4 6s or 4 8s seems plausible as it increases the digit. I'll choose to bid 4 8s because I have two 8s, making it more believable that there could be at least four 8s in total.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 75356384, I have two 8s. For the opponent's 8 digits, to reach a total of at least 4 8s, they would need to have at least two 8s as well. This is plausible, but not guaranteed. Since the bid is already at 4 8s, raising the bid would require either 5 of any digit or 4 9s, which seems risky without strong evidence. Given I hold two 8s, it's unlikely the total number of 8s exceeds 4 by much. Therefore, challenging the bid of 4 8s is reasonable because the opponent may be bluffing or overestimating the count.
