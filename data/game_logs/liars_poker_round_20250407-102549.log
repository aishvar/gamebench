Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the likelihood of there being only one 0 across both hands is plausible but not certain. Since the current bid is low (1 0s), it's risky to challenge such a conservative bid as it's likely true. A safe and strategic move is to increase the bid slightly. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s and two 4s, so I can comfortably bid on those digits. I'll increase the quantity to 2 and select the digit 2, which I hold two of, making it a credible and safe higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 84243297, I have zero 3s. The current bid is 2 3s, meaning there must be at least two 3s across both hands. Since I have none, all 3s would have to be in Player 0's hand. Given that Player 0 has only 8 digits, having two or more 3s is possible but not highly probable. Since Player 0 is a naive 50/50 bidder and might have overestimated, challenging this bid is a reasonable strategy.
