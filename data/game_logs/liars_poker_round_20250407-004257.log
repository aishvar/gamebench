Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (84087540), I see that I have two 8s. Bidding 2 8s is the most reasonable starting point, as it's the highest quantity of any digit I have and there's a chance the other player might have at least one 8 as well.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s. Bidding 3 9s is a higher quantity than the current bid, making it a valid and strategic move given my hand strength in 9s.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 9s. Since there are only 16 total digits in play, it's unlikely there are 3 or more 9s. I should challenge the bid rather than trying to outbid with a higher quantity or digit that I don't have.
