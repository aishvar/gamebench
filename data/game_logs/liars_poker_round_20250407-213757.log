Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid of the game, I want to start with a conservative but strategic opening bid. Looking at my hand '35269740', I notice that the digit '0' appears once, '2' appears once, '3' once, '4' once, '5' once, '6' once, '7' once, and '9' once. No digit appears more than once, so no strong bias towards any digit. Statistically, with 16 digits total, each digit should appear roughly 1-2 times. It's common to open with a bid of 2 of a digit I have, as it's a safe and reasonable starting point. I will choose '2' of the digit '3' (which I hold), making a minimal but valid opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. To bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. I could bid 2 4s, since I have two 4s. However, a more conservative approach is to bid 3 2s. I have one 2 in my hand, so I'd need at least two more across the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. Since the opponent bid relatively low (2 3s), I suspect they might not have many 3s, so I'll bid 3 2s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. To make a safe bid, I can bid higher on a digit I have a reasonable number of. I have two 4s. Bidding 3 4s seems like a reasonable increase and not too risky. It's possible the other player has no 4s.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 3, 5, 2, 6, 9, 7, 4, 0. There is exactly one '4' in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s, meaning there must be at least three '4's across both hands. Given I only have one, Player 1 would need to have at least two '4's for the bid to be valid. The probability of having two or more '4's in a random 8-digit hand is moderate but not guaranteed. Since it's plausible but not certain, a safe strategic approach is to raise the bid conservatively. The smallest valid raise is to increase the digit with the same quantity, moving to 3 5s. I have one '5', so again Player 1 would need to have at least two '5's, which is similarly plausible. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to 4 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have one '3', one '5', one '4', one '6', one '7', one '9', one '2', and one '0', so no digit appears more than once. Thus, raising the quantity would be riskier. Therefore, the best move is to bid 3 5s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. It's possible there are at least two more 5s between the other player's hand. However, it's also possible they are bluffing. I could bid 3 6s, but that's a weak raise. I could also bid higher than 3, but I don't have a strong read on what digit is more likely to occur frequently in the other player's hand. Since the current bid is relatively low, and I don't have a strong hand, I'll challenge.
