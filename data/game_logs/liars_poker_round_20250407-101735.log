--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, two 9s, one 7, one 3, one 4, and one 0. A safe opening bid would be 2 of a common digit in my hand. Starting with '2 6s' leverages my two 6s and is a conservative yet reasonable opening bid.
