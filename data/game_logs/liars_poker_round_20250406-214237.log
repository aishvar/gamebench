Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 1 0s, I need to make a strictly higher bid. Looking at my hand, 16597624, I notice I have one 6. Since the goal is to bid higher, either by quantity or digit, and considering my hand does not offer a clear advantage in quantity for any digit, I should look for a digit that is higher than 0 and reasonably expected to appear in both hands. Given that I have a 6 and assuming a somewhat even distribution, bidding on a higher digit like 6 seems reasonable. However, I only have one 6, so I must consider what I can reasonably expect from both hands combined. Bidding 2 6s seems like a cautious increase, considering I have one 6 and it's possible the other player could have at least one 6 as well, given the distribution of digits.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 2 7s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Looking at my hand, 16597624, I notice I have one 6 and no 7s or higher digits that would directly influence my bid. Since the current bid is 2 7s, to make a higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. However, without having any 7s or higher digits in my hand, and considering the bid history where a bid of 2 6s was already made, increasing the quantity seems more reasonable. I will bid on a digit that I have at least one of, to increase the chances of my bid being valid. Bidding on 6s again but with a higher quantity than previously bid, or moving to a digit I have, seems like a viable strategy. Since I only have one 6 and the previous bid was 2 6s, moving to a higher digit isn't feasible without more information. Thus, considering the digits I have, bidding 3 6s seems like a reasonable move, as it increases the quantity from the previous bid of 2 6s, making it a higher bid than 2 7s in terms of quantity.
