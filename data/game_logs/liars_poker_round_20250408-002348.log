Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 2 3s is a safe move since I can ensure at least two 3s exist, and it's a lower digit which might be easier to build upon in future bids.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than this. I have a 5 and a 3 in my hand, so I know there are at least 2 3s and 1 5 in total. Bidding 3 5s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. Bidding 3 8s is a higher bid because 8 is a higher digit than 5. I have two 8s, so if the opponent has at least one, the bid will be valid. Challenging the current bid is risky because the total number of 5s is likely to be exactly 3, which would make me lose. Therefore, making a bid of 3 8s is the better option.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than this. I have a 5 and a few other digits in my hand, but I don't have any 8s or 9s. However, I can try to make a reasonable bid based on my hand and the information available. Since I have a 5 and the current bid is 3 8s, I can bid 4 5s or higher if I think it's possible. But I should also consider challenging if I think the bid is unlikely. Given my hand 57096835, I have one 5 and one 8. The bid of 3 8s seems plausible but I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I will bid 4 5s as it seems reasonable and I have at least one 5.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 5s. Since I have no 5s, the total number of 5s depends on Player 1's hand. Bidding 4 8s is a higher bid and leverages my own hand's strength, making it a safer move than challenging or bidding on 5s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains one 8. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 16 digits in total, bidding 5 9s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, so the total number of 9s depends entirely on Player 1's hand. Bidding 5 9s requires at least five 9s in their 8-digit hand, which seems unlikely. Challenging is a strategic move to test if Player 1 is bluffing.
