Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so any valid bid is acceptable. I have two 9s, two 2s, one 5, one 6, and two 7s in my hand. Bidding 1 9s is a safe and reasonable starting bid, leveraging the digits I have.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, making the current bid of 1 9s highly questionable. Since the maximum possible 9s in play is 2 (one from each player), bidding 2 9s is a safe and logical next step, increasing the quantity while staying within realistic limits.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s is a logical next step, increasing the quantity. It's a reasonable bid given my hand and the previous bids. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit, but 9s is the current focus and I have cards to support it. Bidding 3 9s is better than challenging as it's likely the opponent has at least one 9, making the bid plausible.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 9s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total, it's unlikely there are 3 or more 9s in play. I should challenge the bid.
