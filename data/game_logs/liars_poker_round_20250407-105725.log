Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 3s and two 7s. I will bid 3 3s to start.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one 3 in my hand (64418926), so the total count of 3s is at least 1. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I see one 6, and there's a possibility that the other player might have some 6s or higher digits, I will bid 3 6s. This increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, making it a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. Since I don't have any 6s, and the bid is already at 3, it's risky to increase the bid on 6s. Instead, I'll increase the quantity and bid 4 0s. This is a safe and valid move.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. My hand is 64418926, which contains no 0s. The total count of 0s across both players is at least the number of 0s in my hand (0) plus the number of 0s in Player 0's hand. Since I don't know Player 0's hand, I have to make an educated guess. The bid of 4 0s is relatively low considering there are 16 digits in total. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. I see that I have a 6 and a couple of other digits, but not many high digits. I can bid higher than 4 0s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 4 1s is a safe and reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Bidding 5 2s is a safe increase and doesn't rely on the number of 1s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 2S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. My hand is 64418926, which contains one 2. The total count of 2s across both hands must be at least 5 for the bid to be valid. Given that I have one 2, the other player must have at least 4 2s for the bid to be valid. While possible, it's a bit high. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I can see that I have no 3s, one 6, and other digits distributed. Bidding 5 3s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and keeps the quantity the same, making it a relatively safe bid given the information I have.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have two 3s in my hand. I could bid 6 3s, or I could bid 5 of a higher number. Since I have a 7, I will bid 6 3s. It is a safer bid than challenging.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 3S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. My hand is 64418926, which contains one 3. So, the total count of 3s across both hands is at least 1 (mine) + unknown (opponent's). The maximum possible count for any digit is 16, and since there are 8 digits per player, the total count of 3s could be between 1 and 16. The current bid of 6 3s is plausible but on the higher side if my opponent doesn't have many 3s. However, bidding higher requires a good guess. I can bid 6 4s (same quantity, higher digit) or increase the quantity. I have no 4s, so bidding 6 4s might be risky if my opponent challenges and I don't have a good chance of winning. Increasing the quantity to 7 with a lower or the same digit is also an option. I can bid 7 3s. Given the information, I think bidding 7 3s is a reasonable move as it increases the quantity, making it harder for my opponent to challenge unless they have a lot of 3s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 3s. I have two 3s in my hand. It's possible there are at least 7 threes in total. However, I could bid higher. I will bid 8 3s, increasing the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 3S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 8 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 3s. My hand is 64418926, which contains one 3. I have to make a bid that is higher than 8 3s. I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have information about my own hand, I can see that I have a total of 1 three. Assuming the other player might have some threes as well, but not excessively many more than me, bidding more than 8 3s requires some strategy. I can bid 8 4s or increase the quantity. Given that I have two 6s, it seems reasonable to believe there could be a significant number of higher digits. However, directly challenging 8 3s might be risky if the opponent has many 3s. Bidding 9 3s seems too high given I only have one 3 and it's unlikely I have more than half of the total count of 3s. Bidding 8 4s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit and is based on the fact that there are other digits and possibly a distribution that could make this plausible.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 8 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. The maximum possible quantity is 16. Bidding 9 4s is a safe increase. I could also bid 8 of a higher number, but I don't have any of those in my hand either. Therefore, I will bid 9 4s.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 9 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since the maximum quantity is 16 and there are 16 digits in total, bidding 10 4s is possible but seems high. I can bid 9 5s, which is a valid higher bid because 5 is greater than 4. I'll choose to bid 9 5s as it seems reasonable given my hand and the current bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 9 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. To bid, I need to increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 10 0s is a safe option since I don't have any 0s and the bid history shows 4 0s was previously bid. I will bid 10 0s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 10 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 0s. I have one 0 in my hand (64418926). The total count of 0s across both players must be at least 10 for the bid to be valid. Given that I have one 0, the other player must have at least 9 0s, which is highly unlikely since they have 8 digits in total. Therefore, I should challenge this bid as it is very likely to be a bluff.
