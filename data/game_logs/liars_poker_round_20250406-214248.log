Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening bid and there is no current bid, I want to start with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand. I have two 1s and two 3s in my hand. Starting with '3 1s' leverages the fact I already hold two 1s, making it likely there are at least three 1s across both hands. This is a safe opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 1s', to make a valid bid, I must either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since my hand is 95726621, I have no 1s but I do have multiple occurrences of other digits. Notably, I have three 6s in my hand, which suggests that bidding on 6s could be a strong move. Considering the bid history only includes '3 1s' so far, and without knowing the exact distribution of digits in the other player's hand, bidding on a digit I have multiple of seems strategic. Thus, bidding '4 6s' seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity from the current bid and chooses a higher digit, leveraging the information from my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 3, 1, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0. I have zero 6s. The opponent has 8 digits, and for their bid of 4 6s to be true, they must have at least 4 6s in their hand, since I have none. This is unlikely, as having half of their digits being 6s is a rare occurrence. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
