Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 90256209. I can see I have one 0, one 2, one 5, one 6, and two 9s. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and a conservative assumption about the opponent's hand. I have two 9s, so bidding on 9s seems like a good start. I'll bid 3 9s, assuming there's at least one more 9 in the opponent's hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, so the total count of 0s is at least 1. I need to make a higher bid than 4 0s. The next possible bid can be either 5 0s or 4 1s. Since I don't have information about the count of 1s, I'll increase the quantity. Bidding 5 0s seems reasonable as it directly increases the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have the digits 90256209, and I can count that I have one 1. The total count of 1s across both hands must be at least 1 (mine) and at most 9 (if the other player has 8 ones, which is highly unlikely). The current bid of 5 1s is possible but seems a bit high given that I only have one 1. However, it's not impossible since my opponent could have up to 4 more 1s. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about the other digits in my opponent's hand, I'll consider a conservative increase. Bidding 5 2s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid and higher bid according to the rules.
