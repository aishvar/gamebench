Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (39574206), I have two 2s. Bidding 2 2s is the most conservative and safe starting bid, as it's based on the actual count in my hand and sets a baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have two 8s in my hand, so even if the opponent has none, the total is at least two. Bidding 2 8s is a valid higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity.

Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 8s. Since there are only 16 digits in total, the likelihood of there being at least 2 8s is relatively low. Given that I have no 8s, it's reasonable to challenge the bid rather than trying to make a higher bid that might not be possible.
