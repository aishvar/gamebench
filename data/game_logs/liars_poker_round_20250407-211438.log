Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that there are no bids yet, I should start by bidding on a digit that is likely to be high in quantity. The digit 1 is a good starting point, as it is a relatively common digit in many numbers. I also have a 1 in my hand, which gives me some confidence in my bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the lack of information about the other player's hand, I should start by bidding on a digit that has a high possibility of being present in at least one of the hands. Since I have a '4' in my hand, I'll bid on the digit '4' with a quantity of 1, which is a conservative start.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 ones. Looking at my hand (3 5 1 2 3 3 2 2), I have only 1 one. For Player 0's bid to be valid, there must be at least 3 more ones in their hand. Statistically, the expected total number of ones across 16 digits is about 1.6 (16/10), so 4 is already above average. Given I only have 1, it's unlikely the other player has 3 or more ones. Therefore, challenging is a strong move here.
