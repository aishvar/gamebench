Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 3s, one 6, one 2, one 4, and one 7. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I will start with '2 8s', as I hold two 8s myself, making it a safe initial bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I need to bid higher, either by increasing the quantity or the digit. My hand is 59150247, which contains one 8. It's possible that together we have at least 3 8s or more of a higher digit. Bidding 3 8s increases the quantity and seems like a reasonable next step.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which would require my opponent to have at least one 8. This is plausible, so challenging now is risky. A safe and strategic move is to raise the bid slightly. Since I cannot bid 3 9s (digit higher but same quantity) without better knowledge, the reasonable next bid is 4 8s, increasing the quantity by one.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (from 59150247, the digit 8 is not present but there are other digits). To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 is a possibility if I think the other player might not have many 8s, but it risks being too high if they have several. Alternatively, bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity (4) is a safer option. I can bid 4 9s. My hand has no 9s, but it's a relatively safe bid as it requires the other player to have at least four 9s, which is plausible but not certain.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains one 9, so for the current bid of 4 9s to be valid, the opponent must have at least three 9s in their hand. With only eight digits per player, it is statistically unlikely for one player to hold three or more 9s. Additionally, the bid increased from 4 8s to 4 9s, which is a digit increase without quantity increase, suggesting possible bluffing. Given the improbability of there being four or more 9s total, challenging is the best move.
