Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 8s, two 9s, one 3, and one 4. The most common digits are 2s, 8s, and 9s. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 3 8s, assuming my two 8s plus a likely one in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand (10953306). For the current bid to be true, Player 0 must hold at least three 8s in their 8-digit hand, which is possible but statistically somewhat unlikely. Challenging is an option. However, the bid quantity is still low. I have two 0s and two 3s in my hand. Bidding based on my own digits seems safer than challenging early. Bidding 4 0s requires Player 0 to have at least two 0s, which is plausible (similar likelihood to needing two 3s for a 4 3s bid). Bidding 4 0s increases the quantity, putting more pressure on the opponent, and is well-supported by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 8, 2, 9, 4, 8, 3, 2, 9. Notably, I have zero 0s in my hand. The current bid is 4 0s, which means there must be at least four zeroes across both hands. Since I have none, my opponent would need to have all four or more zeroes, which is quite unlikely given only eight digits. The probability that the opponent holds four or more zeroes is low, so challenging is the best strategic move.
