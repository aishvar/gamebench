--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first turn and there is no current bid. My hand contains two 0s, one 2, one 6, two 9s, one 8, and one 3. A safe and reasonable opening bid is to start with the digit I have multiple copies of. I have two 0s and two 9s, so bidding 2 9s or 2 0s is appropriate. Since both are equal, I'll pick 2 9s as my opening bid.
