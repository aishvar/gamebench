Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 82398639, I notice that I have two 8s and two 9s, along with other digits. Since I have to make a bid that is strictly higher than 'None', I should start with a digit I have in abundance. Starting with a lower quantity and a higher digit seems like a safe strategy to avoid overbidding. Thus, bidding on one of my more frequent digits, like the 8 or 9, at a low quantity seems reasonable. However, to make the bid more believable and to have a higher chance of it being true (considering the opponent's hand is unknown), I'll choose a digit that appears twice in my hand but is not the highest, to leave room for potential higher bids based on the digit's frequency across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 5, 0, 3, 5, 4, 2, 6, 2. I have zero 8s. Since the current bid is 2 8s, that would require my opponent to have both 8s or at least one 8 and me missing all. With 0 in my hand, it's plausible my opponent has two 8s, but unlikely they have more. Since I can't confidently challenge 2 8s, I will make a minimal valid raise. The smallest higher bid is 2 9s (same quantity, higher digit).

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s, which is a relatively low quantity. Given that I have one 9 and it's possible the other player also has at least one, bidding a higher quantity of the same digit seems plausible. However, since I only have one 9, I should consider the likelihood of the other player having enough 9s to meet or exceed the current bid. Considering the bid history, Player 1 bid 2 9s after I bid 2 8s, indicating they might have at least one 9. Given this information, I will make a bid that increases the quantity, as increasing the digit is not feasible without more information about the other player's hand.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 50354262, I have zero 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, meaning there must be at least 3 nines in total across both hands. Since I have none, all 3 would have to be in Player 0's hand of 8 digits, which is unlikely. The probability of having 3 or more of a specific digit in 8 random digits is quite low (~10%). Therefore, I suspect Player 0 is bluffing or overestimating, so challenging now is the best move.
