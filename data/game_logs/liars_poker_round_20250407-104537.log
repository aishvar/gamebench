--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one each of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. The safest opening bid is typically 2 of a digit I possess, as it's likely at least one more exists in the opponent's hand. I'll choose 2s, since I hold one 2, making '2 2s' a reasonable and conservative opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 24853916, I have zero 3s. Since there are 8 digits in my opponent's hand, the bid of 2 3s is quite plausible, as even with none in my hand, they could easily have two or more 3s. Challenging now is risky. To raise the bid, the minimal increment is either 3 3s or 2 4s. I do have one 4, so bidding 2 4s is a safe minimal increment, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 5. The current bid is 2 5s, which requires at least one more 5 in the opponent's 8 digits. This is plausible. Since it's early in bidding and safer to escalate, I can increase the quantity to 3 and select a digit I have good coverage on. I have two 2s, so bidding 3 2s leverages my hand strength and is a reasonable incremental raise.
