Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can start with any valid bid. I have two 4s and one 6 in my hand. Bidding 3 4s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 4, making my bid valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 8, 7, 5, 6, 9, 7, 0, 1, which contains no '4's. The opponent bid '3 4s', meaning they likely have some 4s, but since I have none, it's uncertain if there are at least three 4s in total. However, with 16 digits total, it's plausible the opponent has at least three 4s. Without strong evidence to challenge yet, I'll cautiously increase the bid slightly to a digit I have multiple occurrences of. I have two '7's, so bidding '3 7s' is a safe and valid increase (same quantity, higher digit).

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 6s and two 4s in my hand. Since 6 is higher than 7, I can safely bid 4 6s, increasing both the quantity and the digit. This bid is likely to be higher than the actual count, but it's a reasonable risk given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one '6'. The opponent has bid '4 6s', meaning they believe there are at least four '6s' total. With only one '6' in my hand, the opponent would need to have at least three '6s' in their eight digits. While possible, this is somewhat unlikely. However, since the total required is not extremely high and I have limited information, challenging could be risky. Instead, I'll bid conservatively by increasing the digit to a higher number at the same quantity, thus making a safer bid. Since I have two '7s' in my hand, bidding '4 7s' seems safer and reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. Since I have one 7, it's possible that the other player has three 7s. However, bidding higher than 4 7s would be risky without more information. Challenging seems too risky since there is a chance the other player has three 7s. I should bid the minimum valid bid, which is 5 0s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one '0' in my own hand. With 16 total digits (8 per player), Player 0 would need to have at least four '0's for their bid to be valid. Given the bidding history, Player 0 has previously bid on digits 4 and 6, suggesting they may not have many '0's. However, since I have only one '0', it's uncertain but plausible Player 0 might have four '0's. Challenging feels risky. Instead, I should make a cautious higher bid on a digit I have multiples of. I have two '7's, and previously bid 4 7s. A bid of 5 7s is slightly risky but still plausible, as Player 0 hasn't explicitly denied having 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 6 7s seems reasonable, as it increases the quantity by one. I could also bid 5 8s, but I only have one 8 in my hand, making it riskier. Challenging seems unwise, as 5 7s is plausible given the bid history and my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand has digits: 8,7,5,6,9,7,0,1. I have two 7s myself. The current bid is 6 7s, meaning Player 0 believes there are at least four additional 7s among their eight digits. Given that Player 0 previously bid on different digits and then switched to 7s, it suggests they may have some 7s but perhaps not as many as four. Considering I hold two 7s, the opponent would need to have at least four 7s in their hand alone. This seems somewhat unlikely given their varied bidding pattern. However, since they confidently raised to 6 7s, there's a possibility they hold multiple 7s. Still, bidding higher (7 0s or 7 7s) would be risky since I only have one 0 and two 7s. With this uncertainty, the safest strategic choice is to challenge the bid.
