Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can make the first bid. Looking at my hand (92949384), I see that I have two 9s and one 4. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but not too low. Bidding '2 9s' seems like a good starting point because it reflects a digit I have, and the quantity is modest.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. Given that I have a 9 in my hand and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. My hand contains one 9, so I will increase the quantity and/or digit. I will bid 3 9s as it seems like a reasonable increase, considering I have one 9 and the possibility of others having more.

--- Turn: Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '3 9s'. Looking at my hand (63005973), I have 0 nines. Since there are 3 players with 8 digits each, there are 24 total digits in play. Player 1 has bid that there are at least 3 nines total. Given that I have 0 nines, this means Players 0 and 1 would need to have at least 3 nines between them. This is certainly possible - Player 0's initial bid of '2 9s' suggests they have at least 1 or 2 nines. I could challenge, but it's too risky at this early stage with such a low bid. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have one 0, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 7, and two 9s in my hand. I could bid '4 0s', but I only have one 0 myself. A safer option would be to bid '4 3s' or '4 5s' or '4 6s' or '4 7s', but again I only have one of each. I think the safest bid is to increase the quantity to 4 and choose a digit I have more of, or to keep the quantity at 3 but choose a higher digit. Since I don't have any digit more than once except for 9 (which I can't bid since it's not higher than the current bid), I'll go with '4 0s'.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. My hand is 92949384, which contains no 0s. Given that there are 3 players and each has 8 digits, the total count of 0s can be at most 16 (if all other players had all 0s, which is highly unlikely). However, the probability that there are at least 4 0s is low, especially considering my hand has none. I need to either challenge or make a bid that is higher. Since the current bid is 4 0s, my next possible bid can either be a higher quantity (5 or more) with the same digit or the same quantity (4) with a higher digit. The next higher digit is 1. I have one 9 and no 0s, but I can try to bid on a higher digit. Bidding 4 1s seems plausible because it increases the digit, and there's a chance others might have 1s. However, I should consider the likelihood and the fact that I'm not sure about the distribution. Challenging 4 0s is also an option, but it's a bit risky without knowing the others' hands. I'll choose to bid 4 1s as it's a relatively safe increase in digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and there are 3 players with 8 secret digits each, I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 4 1s in total. Since I only have one 1, I must consider if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. The bid history shows increasing confidence in higher digits and quantities. I will challenge the bid because 4 1s seems unlikely given the distribution of digits and the fact that I only have one 1.
