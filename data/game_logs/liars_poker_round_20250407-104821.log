Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. In my hand, I have two 0s, two 5s, two 8s, one 4, and one 6. A safe and strategic opening bid would be 2 5s, as I already hold two 5s myself, making it likely that the total count is at least two, and it sets a moderate baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6, which makes it plausible that there are at least two 6s total, matching the current bid. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the digit or the quantity. Since increasing the digit to 7 with quantity 2 is a minimal raise, and I don't have many 7s (none in fact), a safer strategic move is to increase the quantity to 3 for a digit I have some knowledge about. I have three 0s in my hand, so bidding 3 0s leverages my strong hand and is a reasonable incremental raise.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s, two 5s, one 4, one 6, one 8, and one 9. The current bid is 3 1s, but I have zero 1s, making it uncertain how many 1s exist overall. Rather than challenging now, a safer approach is to increase the bid on a digit I hold multiple times to maintain pressure. Since I hold two 5s and the previous bid was 2 5s, I can confidently bid 3 5s, which is a valid higher bid than 3 1s (same quantity but higher digit).

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 85564009, I have two 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, so for it to be valid, there needs to be at least one more 6 in Player 1's hand. Since Player 1 has been incrementally raising the digit without increasing quantity, they may not have strong evidence of more 6s. The probability of there being four or more 6s is low given I hold two. Therefore, instead of raising the bid further, it is strategically sound to challenge now, as the current bid likely overstates the total number of 6s.
