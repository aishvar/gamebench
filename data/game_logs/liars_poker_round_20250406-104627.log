Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. I need to establish a starting point. My hand is 22613365. I have two 2s, two 3s, and two 6s. The total number of digits in play is 16 (2 players * 8 digits). The expected average count for any digit is 1.6. Since I have two 2s, bidding '2 2s' is a safe opening bid. It's directly supported by my hand and is statistically plausible (it only requires zero 2s from the opponent to be true, and is likely true if the opponent has even one 2). It's a low bid, leaving room for future increases.

Player 1 response was not valid JSON after cleaning: 'To determine the best course of action, let's first analyze the given game state and the current bid.

1. **Your Hand**: 90614092
   - Breaking down your hand: 
     - 9: 1
     - 0: 1
     - 6: 1
     - 1: 1
     - 4: 1
     - 0: 1
     - 9: 1
     - 2: 1
   - Your hand contains two 9s, two 0s, and one each of 6, 1, 4, and 2.

2. **Current Bid**: 2 2s
   - The current bid is on the quantity of the digit '2'. It suggests that there are at least 2 twos across all players' hands.

3. **Your Hand Analysis**:
   - You have 1 '2'. 
   - The bid is on '2's, and you know there's at least one '2' in your hand.

4. **Total Digits in Play**: 16 (8 digits per player * 2 players)
   - The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.

5. **Bid Analysis**:
   - The current bid is 2 2s. To make a higher bid, you need to either bid a higher quantity of '2's or the same quantity of a higher digit.

6. **Reasoning for Action**:
   - You have one '2', so the current bid of 2 '2's seems plausible because there are 8 other digits in the opponent's hand, and it's possible they have at least one more '2'.
   - To make a higher bid, you could either increase the quantity (e.g., 3 2s) or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit (e.g., 2 3s).
   - Bidding 3 2s seems a bit aggressive because you're not sure of the opponent's hand, but it's a possible move if you think they might have more than one '2'.
   - Bidding on a higher digit (like 2 3s or higher) is more conservative and based on the fact that you need to bid higher than '2'. You don't have any '3's, but the bid on '3's could be a reasonable guess.

7. **Choosing the Action**:
   - Let's consider bidding 2 3s. This keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid. You don't have any '3's, but this is a relatively conservative bid that doesn't commit to a high quantity.

8. **Action**:
   - Your hand doesn't directly inform you about the opponent's hand, but you can make an educated guess. Since you have to bid higher than '2 2s', and you have one '2', a reasonable next step is to bid on a higher digit with the same quantity.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have the digits 9, 0, 6, 1, 4, 0, 9, 2. I can see I have one 2, so there is at least one more 2 in Player 0's hand. A reasonable next bid should be higher than 2 2s. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 0s and no other 2s, bidding 2 9s seems like a safe and reasonable increase in the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 22613365. The current bid is 2 9s, made by Player 1. I have zero 9s in my hand. For the bid to be true, Player 1 must have at least two 9s out of their 8 digits. While possible, it's not guaranteed. However, challenging a bid this low is risky. I previously bid 2 2s, and I have two 2s in my hand. I also have two 3s and two 6s. Bidding 3 2s is a safe and logical next step. It's a higher bid than 2 9s (higher quantity). It leverages my strong holding of 2s (I only need one more 2 from the opponent's 8 digits for the bid to be true), and it continues the information suggested by my first bid. The quantity 3 is still very low out of 16 total digits, making it a likely bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have the hand 90614092, which contains one 2. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. I see that I have one 9 in my hand, and the previous bid was 2 9s, so it's plausible there are more 9s. However, increasing the quantity of 2s or bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity seems more reasonable. I have one 2, so there are at least 2 2s between the two hands. Bidding 3 3s is a valid move as it increases the digit. Alternatively, bidding 4 2s is also valid as it increases the quantity. Considering my hand and the bid history, bidding 3 3s seems like a reasonable and safe move.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 22613365. The current bid is 3 3s. I have two 3s in my hand, meaning the current bid requires Player 1 to have at least one 3, which is quite likely. Challenging seems risky.
I need to make a bid higher than 3 3s. Options are increasing the quantity (e.g., 4 0s) or keeping the quantity at 3 and increasing the digit (e.g., 3 4s, 3 5s, 3 6s, etc.).
I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding '3 6s' requires Player 1 to have only one 6 among their 8 digits for the bid to be true. This is statistically probable and makes '3 6s' a safe and credible bid. It's higher than '3 3s' (same quantity, higher digit) and puts the pressure back on the opponent without overextending.

1. **Your Hand**: 90614092

     - 4: 1 occurrence
     - 0: 1 occurrence (second 0)

     - 2: 1 occurrence

   - Your hand contains: 0s (2), 9s (2), 6s (1), 1s (1), 4s (1), 2s (1)

2. **Current Bid**: 3 6s by Player 0.
   - The current bid implies that there are at least three 6s across both players' hands.

3. **Your Hand's Contribution**: You have 1 six.

4. **Analysis**:
   - Since you have 1 six and the bid is for at least 3 sixs, the other player must have at least 2 sixs for the bid to be valid.
   - Given that you have a total of 8 digits and the distribution is somewhat spread out, there's no clear indication that the other player doesn't have 2 sixs, especially since you don't have any information about their hand.
   - The bid of 3 6s is not excessively high considering the total number of digits in play is 16. It's plausible that there are 3 sixs.

5. **Bidding History**:
   - The history shows an escalating bid in terms of quantity and digit. 
   - Player 0 started with 2 2s, and you responded with 2 9s (increasing the digit).
   - The bids continued with increases either in quantity or digit.

6. **Decision**:
   - To make a higher bid than 3 6s, you can either bid a higher quantity (4 Xs) or the same quantity with a higher digit (3 Ys where Y > 6).
   - You can see that there's a possibility of having more 9s since you have 2 nines. Bidding on 9s could be a reasonable strategy since you know there's a good chance of having more 9s in total (you already have 2).
   - Bidding 4 6s is a possibility if you think the other player might have more 6s, but it's a bit of a risk since you're not sure.
   - Bidding 3 7s or higher (e.g., 3 8s, 3 9s) is an option. Given you have 2 nines, bidding 3 9s seems plausible and is a higher bid than 3 6s.

7. **Action**:
   - Let's choose to bid 3 9s because you have 2 nines, making it more likely that the total count of 9s across both hands is at least 3.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 22613365. I have two 6s. The current bid is 4 6s, made by Player 1. For this bid to be true, there must be at least four 6s in total across both hands (16 digits). Since I have two 6s, Player 1 must have at least two 6s in their hand of 8 digits.

Player 1 raised my previous bid of 3 6s to 4 6s. This could indicate they have confidence in 6s (possessing two or more), or it could be a bluff to push me off the digit, knowing I likely based my 3 6s bid on having one or two 6s.

Making a higher bid seems risky. The next bid would be 4 7s (or higher digit), or 5 0s (or higher digit).
- Bidding 5 2s (I have two 2s) requires Player 1 to have three 2s.
- Bidding 5 3s (I have two 3s) requires Player 1 to have three 3s.
- Bidding 5 6s (I have two 6s) requires Player 1 to have three 6s. This is possible if they have >=3, but risky if they only had the two needed for their 4 6s bid.
- Bidding on other digits (4 7s+, 5 0s+) would be largely unsupported by my hand.

Given that Player 1 needing two specific digits (6s) out of eight is not guaranteed, and the risks associated with making a higher bid based on my current hand, challenging the 4 6s bid seems like a reasonable move to test the opponent's claim directly.
