Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with 2 9s is safe because even if the opponent has none, the total count (2) matches the bid. This forces the next player to bid a higher quantity (minimum 3 of any digit) rather than a higher digit, limiting their options.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand. Since there are 16 digits in total, and I hold zero 9s, the opponent must have at least 2 9s for their bid to be valid. While it's plausible they hold 2, it's somewhat risky to challenge such a low bid early. Instead, I'll increase the bid conservatively by raising the digit at the same quantity. I have two 8s, so bidding 2 8s is reasonable and strictly higher than 2 9s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, 37218167, there are no 9s. Since the current bid is only 2 9s, it's plausible that the opponent has two or more 9s, so challenging now would be risky. The minimal safe move is to raise the bid slightly. I will increase the digit to 2 9s -> 2 9s is current, so I must either increase quantity or digit. Since digit cannot be increased beyond 9, I will increase the quantity to 3 0s, which is the next valid higher bid. I have one 0 (none actually), so 3 0s is risky, but more plausible than 3 9s, given no 9s in my hand. Alternatively, I can bid 3 1s since I have two 1s, making it more plausible. So, bidding 3 1s is a safer incremental bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 1s, which can be beaten by bidding 3 9s (same quantity, higher digit). Given that the opponent has 8 digits, there's a reasonable chance they have at least one more 9, making the total at least three. This bid maintains pressure and leverages my strong 9s while avoiding the risk of challenging a possible bluff on 1s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 37218167, I have zero 9s. Given that I have none, for the current bid of 3 9s to be valid, the opponent must have all three or more 9s in their hand of 8 digits, which is possible but somewhat unlikely. Since I hold no 9s, challenging here is a good strategic move because the probability they have 3 or more 9s is low.
