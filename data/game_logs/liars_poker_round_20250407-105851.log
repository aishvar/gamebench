Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains no 0s, so I cannot contribute to the current bid of 1 0s. However, since there are 8 unknown digits in Player 0's hand, it's quite plausible they have at least one 0, making an immediate challenge risky. Instead, I will make a minimal higher bid. I have two 7s, so bidding 2 7s is both safe based on my hand and a valid increase over 1 0s.
