Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 95178746. I see two 7s and no other repeated digits more than twice. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but not too low. Bidding 2 7s seems like a good starting point as it reflects some information from my hand without being too aggressive.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Since the bid is relatively low, I could bid higher. I will bid 3 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity and bid a higher digit. Since I don't have many 7s, I'll consider bidding on a higher digit. I have one 9, which is higher than 7. So, bidding 3 9s is a valid and reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 4 0s is a valid and safe increase.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I need to either challenge it or make a higher bid. My hand is 95178746, which contains no 0s. The total count of 0s across both players is at least 4 if the bid is honest. I have 8 digits, with none being 0. The opponent has 8 digits, and for the bid of 4 0s to be valid, they must have at least 4 0s. This seems unlikely but possible. I should analyze my hand for potential higher bids. I can see I have one 9 and no high digits (8, 9) in abundance. Bidding 4 1s is a reasonable next step as it's a higher digit than 0, and I can potentially get away with it if my opponent doesn't have many 1s either. However, I should be cautious and not overbid. Let's start with a safer '4 1s'.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. To increase the bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I will increase the digit to 2, keeping the quantity at 4. This seems like a reasonable increase without being too risky.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand is 95178746, which contains the digits 9, 5, 1, 7, 8, 7, 4, 6. I have one 2, so the total count of 2s must be at least one (mine) plus however many the other player has. It's possible the other player has some 2s, but bidding 4 3s or higher seems reasonable as it increases the digit. I'll choose to bid 4 3s as it's a conservative increase.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, which is a safe increase. However, since the bid is relatively low, I will bid 5 3s to try and push the other player to challenge or bid higher.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 3S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have the hand 95178746, which contains one 3. The total count of 3s across both hands must be at least 1 (mine) and at most 9 (if the other player has 8 threes, which is highly unlikely). The bid of 5 3s is quite high, but not impossible. However, I can bid 5 4s, which is a higher digit than 3, making it a valid and potentially safer bid. Alternatively, I could challenge, but given that I have some information about my hand and the bid isn't ridiculously high, making a strategic bid seems more prudent.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. To bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. I could bid 6 of any digit or 5 of a digit higher than 4. Given I have two 9s, bidding 6 0s seems like a reasonable and safe option. Bidding higher on 9s might be too risky.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have the digits 95178746, which means I have no 0s. Given that there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand, and I have none, the total count of 0s can be at most 8. Bidding 7 0s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity. However, considering the likelihood of having more than 6 0s, it seems a bit high. I'll consider bidding 6 1s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid move according to the rules.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. It's possible there are six 1s in total, but it's also possible the opponent is bluffing. I could bid higher, but I'm not confident enough to go much higher. Given the bid history and the fact that the opponent has bid several times, I think it's more likely they are bluffing. Therefore, I will challenge.
