Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (71172280), I have two 7s, two 2s, two 1s, one 8, and one 0. Since I have two 7s in my hand, there could be more in my opponent's hand. I'll start with a conservative bid of 3 7s, which means I'm claiming there are at least 3 sevens between both our hands.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have zero 7s in my hand (88015699). This means the bid requires Player 0 to have at least three 7s in their 8-digit hand, which is possible but not highly probable. Instead of challenging immediately, I can make a higher bid based on my own hand. I have two 9s. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid and is statistically likely to be true (requiring only one 9 from the opponent's 8 digits). This shifts the pressure back to Player 0.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. In my hand, I have two 7s, two 2s, one 1, one 8, and zero 9s. The current bid is '3 9s', meaning Player 1 claims there are at least 3 nines total between our hands. Since I have zero 9s, all 3 would need to be in Player 1's hand. With 8 digits per player, it's possible but not guaranteed that Player 1 has 3 nines. I could bid '4 0s', '4 1s', '4 2s', or '4 7s' based on my hand, but I'll go with '4 2s' since I have two 2s already.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 88015699. I have zero 2s. For the current bid of '4 2s' to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least four 2s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a single player having four or more of a specific digit is very low. Therefore, it is highly likely that the bid '4 2s' is false.
