Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 9s, two 4s, one 6, one 8, and one 1. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is to call '2 3s', reflecting my two 3s, which is unlikely to be immediately challenged and leaves room for escalation.
