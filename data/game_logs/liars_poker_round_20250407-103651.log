Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, it's quite likely there is at least one more zero in Player 0's hand, making a higher bid reasonable. The safest minimal increase is to bid 2 0s, which is a natural progression and keeps pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.
