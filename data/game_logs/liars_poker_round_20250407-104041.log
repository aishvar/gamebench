--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I don't have any 7s. I could bid 3 0s, which is a valid higher bid. However, I'm not confident about the number of 7s. Since the previous bid was 2 6s, and the current bid is 2 7s, it seems like the other player is incrementally bidding up. I will bid 3 0s, a safe bid.
