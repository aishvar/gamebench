--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits 0, 0, 5, 3, 9, 0, 8, 9. The digit 0 appears three times, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. Statistically, it's safe to start with a conservative opening bid on the digit I have the most of. Given there are 16 digits in total, bidding 3 zeros is reasonable as I already hold 3 myself, making it likely there are more zeros in the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s, and I have no 0s in my hand. Since the total count of 0s is determined by Player 0's hand alone, challenging is a strategic move to test the validity of their bid.
