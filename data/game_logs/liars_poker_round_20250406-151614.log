Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 8, and one 9, so no repeated digits. The safest opening bid is typically 2 of a digit I hold, but since I only have singles, I will start with a conservative and common opening bid of 2 3s, as 3 is a mid-range digit and likely to appear at least twice across both hands.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have a total of 8 digits and there's one 3, bidding 2 4s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases the digit, making it harder for the opponent to have a higher count of 4s than I do of 3s, and it's a relatively safe bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 93681042, I have one 4. The current bid is 2 4s, which is plausible since I have one and the opponent likely has at least one. Making a minimal higher bid is strategically safe. I don't have any 5s, but I have two 0s, so bidding 2 5s is not possible, but I can increase the digit with the same quantity to 2 5s. Alternatively, I can increase quantity to 3 of some digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s and one 9, so bidding 3 0s is reasonable, expecting the opponent might have at least one 0. Therefore, I will raise the bid to 3 0s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I don't have many 0s, I'll consider bidding on a higher digit. I see that I have a 3 and other digits, but no very high digits. Bidding 3 1s is a reasonable next step as it is a higher digit than 0 and still within a plausible range given the total count of digits.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 1S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 9, 3, 6, 8, 1, 0, 4, 2. I only have one '1'. The current bid is 3 1s, which means there must be at least three '1's in total. Since I only have one, my opponent would need to have at least two '1's for the bid to be valid. The probability of that is moderate but not certain. However, I also have one '0', one '3', one '4', and one '6', so I can consider making a higher bid on a digit where I have at least one to increase credibility. A safe incremental bid would be 3 2s, which is a valid raise since digit 2 is higher than 1 at the same quantity, and I have one '2'. This keeps pressure on my opponent without overcommitting.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I see one 2 in my hand, it's possible that there are at least 3 2s in total. I will increase the digit to make a higher bid. Bidding 3 3s is a reasonable next step as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 3S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 9, 3, 6, 8, 1, 0, 4, 2. I have exactly one 3, which means for the current bid of 3 3s to be valid, the opponent must have at least two 3s. Given the distribution of digits, two 3s in the opponent's hand is plausible but not guaranteed. Since the bid is moderate and not highly unlikely, rather than challenge now, I can increase the bid safely. I also have one 0 and one 1, so increasing to 3 4s would be risky because I only have one 4. But since I have one 6 and one 8, and the quantity is still 3, I can safely bid 3 4s (higher digit, same quantity) or 3 5s. Alternatively, I can raise the quantity to 4 of a digit I have. I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 8, and one 9, so no digit with multiple copies. Therefore, the safest is to increase the bid to 3 4s, as it is the minimal legal raise and keeps pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. The bidding history suggests a pattern of increasing the digit. I should bid higher than 3 4s. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit. Alternatively, I could bid 4 0s or higher quantities with lower digits, but given the pattern, matching the quantity and increasing the digit seems like a safe strategy.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 9, 3, 6, 8, 1, 0, 4, 2. I have zero 5s, which means all 5s would have to be in the opponent's hand to make the current bid of 3 5s valid. Since the opponent only has 8 digits, it's unlikely they have three 5s. Given that, the probability that there are at least 3 total 5s is low, so challenging is the best move.
