Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s and two 6s in my hand. Given the current bid is None, I should start with a reasonable bid. Bidding 2 6s seems like a good starting point, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 6s, so the current bid of 2 6s relies entirely on my opponent holding at least two 6s. This is plausible but somewhat risky to assume. Instead of challenging now, I can safely increase the bid by raising the digit to 2 7s, since I hold one 7 (digit 7 is missing, so raising the digit isn't possible), or increase the quantity. Alternatively, I notice I have two 2s, so a safe and strategic higher bid would be 3 2s, which leverages my own hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have two 2s in my hand. Bidding 4 2s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 2S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 2s. The current bid is 4 2s, which requires at least two more 2s in my opponent's hand. Since each player has 8 digits, it is possible but somewhat unlikely that the opponent has two or more 2s. Given that probability and the fact that raising the bid would mean either increasing the quantity to 5 (which is very risky) or increasing the digit at the same quantity (which is not allowed because digit 2 is already the current bid), the best strategic move is to challenge the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
