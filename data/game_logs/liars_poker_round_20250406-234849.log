Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 92230950, I notice that I have two 0s, two 2s, one 3, one 5, and one 9. Since I have two 0s and the goal is to make a bid that is reasonable yet potentially challenging for the other player to follow, I will choose a digit and quantity that reflects the information I have. Bidding on a digit I have at least one of seems prudent. Considering my hand and the fact that I want to start with a relatively safe bet, I will bid on one of my more frequent digits or one that I think might be less common, to make it harder for the opponent to challenge or follow.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand has two 8s and two 6s. The current bid is 2 2s. Bidding 2 8s is a valid higher bid since 8 > 2, leveraging my existing 8s to ensure the total count is at least 2 even if the opponent has none. This avoids immediate risk while increasing the bid strategically.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '2 8s', I must decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 9, 2, 2, 3, 0, 9, 5, and 0. Since I don't have any 8s in my hand and the bid is for '2 8s', it's possible that Player 1 has at least one 8, but without more information, it's hard to assess the likelihood of there being two 8s in total. However, considering the rules and aiming to make a strategic move, I should look for a digit that I have a good number of or a digit that is higher than 8 to bid on. Since 8 is a high digit and I don't have any, bidding on a higher digit isn't feasible. I have two 9s and two 2s, but bidding on 9s directly might be risky without knowing Player 1's hand. Given that the current bid is on a high digit (8), and I want to make a bid that is higher, I could consider bidding on a quantity increase for a digit I have, but given the information, challenging seems like a safer bet because I don't have to reveal my hand and can potentially win if the total count of 8s is less than 2.
