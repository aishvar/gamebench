Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 61524281, which contains two 1s, one 2, two 4s, one 5, one 6, and one 8. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. I have a total of 8 digits, and the most frequent digit in my hand is 4 (appearing twice). Considering there are 3 players and 24 digits in total, bidding on a digit that I have seen and increasing the count slightly seems logical. I will bid on 4s, as it's one of the more frequent digits in my hand. A bid of '3 4s' seems like a conservative start, considering my two 4s and the likelihood that other players might have at least one 4.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '4' in my hand. The current bid is 3 '4's. Since there are two other players, it's possible that they have at least two more '4's between them. However, bidding higher with a safer digit seems better. I have two '1's in my hand, so bidding 4 '1's increases the quantity and uses a digit I have more of.

--- Turn: Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have zero 1s in my hand. It's unlikely that there are four 1s total across all three hands. While I could bid higher, challenging seems like the more strategically sound option given my hand and the previous bid. A bid of 4 1s is quite high considering only 24 digits are in play.
