--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have one 0, one 2, two 3s, one 5, two 6s, and one 7 in my hand. A safe starting bid would be 1 0s, as I know there's at least one. However, to be slightly more aggressive, I'll bid 1 2s, as I have one in my hand and it's a reasonable starting point.
