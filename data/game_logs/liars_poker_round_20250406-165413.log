--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding 3 6s is a valid option, as it increases the quantity. Bidding 2 7s is also valid. However, since I only have one 6, and given the opponent's likely strategy, a higher bid might be a bluff. Since the opponent started with a low bid, challenging seems risky. I will bid 3 6s to increase the pressure and see how the opponent reacts. It's a reasonable increase given my hand, and I'm not overly committed.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. Given the bid history, Player 0 seems confident in the number of 6s. Bidding higher on 6s would be risky. I can either bid on a different digit or challenge. Since I have two 8s, and the previous bids were focused on 6s, I will bid 2 8s. This is a valid bid as it is higher than the previous bid of 4 6s, and it is based on the digits I hold.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. It's unlikely there are four 6s in total, especially given the previous bids. Challenging seems like the best option, as the opponent has already bid up to 4 6s and may be bluffing.
