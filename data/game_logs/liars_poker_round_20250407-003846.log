Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. I have two 1s and two 5s in my hand, which are the highest frequency digits. Bidding 4 1s is a reasonable starting point, as it's a higher quantity than the current bid and based on the digits I have.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 92890637, I have zero 1s. The opponent bid 4 1s, claiming there are at least 4 ones total. Since I have none, this would mean they need to have at least 4 ones in their hand of 8 digits. While possible, having 4 of the same digit in 8 random digits is relatively unlikely (around 1.4% chance). Given I can see there are zero 1s in my hand, I should challenge this bid.
