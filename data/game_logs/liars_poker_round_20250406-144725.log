Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can bid anything. I have one 8 in my hand. A conservative bid would be 1 8s. However, to be slightly more aggressive and potentially discourage early challenges, I'll bid 2 1s. This is a valid starting bid, and I have one 1 in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 2 4s is a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit than 1s). Since I already have two 4s, the total count will meet or exceed the bid, making it a safe move.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have one 8 and one 7 and no 4s or 9s in my visible hand but that doesn't directly inform my bid on 4s. However, I can see I have a 2, indicating some presence of lower digits. I can bid higher than 2 4s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 2 5s seems reasonable as it keeps the same quantity but increases the digit, and I have no information to contradict the possibility of at least two 5s across all hands.

--- Turn: Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand (15477509), I have two 5s, which already matches the current bid of 2 5s. Given that there are 24 other digits among the other players, it is very likely there is at least one more 5, making the current bid quite safe. Challenging now would be unwise. The minimal valid raise is either 2 6s or 3 0s (since same quantity but higher digit, or higher quantity). I have two 7s but no two 6s, so the safest incremental bid is to increase the quantity to 3 for a digit I hold. I have one 0, so bidding 3 0s is plausible. Alternatively, I could bid 3 5s, since I have two 5s and it's likely at least one more exists. Therefore, a confident and safe raise is 3 5s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Bidding higher than 3 5s is necessary. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit to 6 seems reasonable as I don't have any 6s, and it's a plausible bid. Bidding 3 6s is a valid move. Alternatively, I could bid 4 5s, but that relies on other players having 5s, which is less certain. Therefore, 3 6s seems like the safest option.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. Bidding 4 0s increases the quantity from 3 to 4 and I have two 0s in my hand, making it plausible to reach at least 4 0s across all hands.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have the hand 23989867, which contains no 0s. The total number of players is 4, and each has 8 digits, making a total of 32 digits. The bid of 4 0s implies that at least 4 zeros are distributed among all players. Given that I have no zeros, the remaining 3 players must have at least 4 zeros. This seems unlikely but not impossible. However, I can bid higher. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 0s, and bidding more 0s seems challenging, I'll consider increasing the digit. A reasonable next bid could be 4 1s, as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

--- Turn: Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand (15477509), I have one '1'. The current bid is 4 1s, meaning there must be at least four '1's across all 32 digits. Since I only have one, there would need to be at least three more among the other 24 digits. Statistically, expecting four or more '1's is plausible but somewhat risky. However, I also have two '7's, which could support a higher bid on 7s. Given the current bid, a safe and strategic move is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, so I'll bid 4 7s, leveraging my two 7s and likely distribution.

Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 7s is necessary. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 7s is possible, but might be risky. Increasing the digit to 4 8s is also a viable option, as I have an 8 in my hand. Considering the previous bids and the general trend, a slightly more conservative approach seems prudent. I will bid 5 7s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. To raise, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 5 9s is valid because 9 is higher than 7. Since I have one 9 and others might have few, this bid shifts the risk to others while maintaining the same quantity but a higher digit.

Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 5 9s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. My hand is 23989867, which contains two 9s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have information about my own hand, I know I have two 9s. The total number of 9s across all hands must be at least 2 (mine) and potentially more. However, bidding more than 5 9s with a quantity that is not reasonably supported by the total number of digits (32) and the distribution is risky. I can bid 6 9s, which is a relatively safe increase in quantity. Alternatively, I can bid 5 Xs where X > 9, but since the digits only go up to 9, bidding 5 9s is the highest possible bid with the same quantity. Thus, my best action is to increase the quantity to 6 9s.

--- Turn: Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand (15477509), I have two 7s, one 9, and one 0. The current bid is 6 9s. Since I only have one 9, there would need to be at least 5 more 9s among the other 24 digits, which is unlikely given typical digit distribution. Bidding higher would require either 7 of some digit or 6 of a digit higher than 9, which is impossible. Given the improbability that there are 6 or more 9s in total, I should challenge.
