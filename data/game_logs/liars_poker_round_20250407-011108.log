Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 3 6s is reasonable, as it allows for the opponent having one more. The higher digit (6) provides a solid foundation for subsequent bids.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s (digits: 95711960). The current bid is 3 6s, which is plausible given my two 6s plus the possibility of at least one 6 in the opponent's hand. Since challenging would likely lose, I should make a safe higher bid. I don't have many 7s, 8s, or 9s, but I do have two 1s, so bidding 3 7s or 3 8s is riskier. Instead, I will increase the quantity to 4 6s, leveraging the two 6s I have.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Challenging risks losing if the opponent has two 6s. Raising to 4 7s increases the digit while keeping the same quantity, which is valid and less likely to be true given my hand has no 7s, forcing the opponent to either challenge or bid higher on a digit with lower prevalence.

Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 9, 5, 7, 1, 1, 9, 6, 0, which contains only one 7. For the bid of 4 7s to be valid, there must be at least three 7s in Player 0's hand, which is somewhat unlikely given the distribution. Since 7s are less common and I only have one, the chance that there are three or more 7s in the opponent's hand is low. Therefore, it's strategically sound to challenge this bid.
