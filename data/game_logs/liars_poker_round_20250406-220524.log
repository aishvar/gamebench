--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, making it a safe choice to bid on 0s. Bidding 2 0s is a reasonable starting point as it's guaranteed to meet the bid with my own hand, and the opponent is unlikely to challenge immediately.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 2 0s, which is possible if the other player also has at least one 0. However, since the bid is relatively low, I can make a higher bid based on the digits in my hand. I have two 7s, so I can bid 2 7s, which is a higher digit than 0.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s, so the total could be 2 or 3. Without knowing Player 1's 7s, it's a gamble. Considering the uncertainty and the potential risk of bidding higher without confidence, challenging seems prudent.
