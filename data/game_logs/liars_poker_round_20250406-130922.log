Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning this is the first bid. I have one 1, one 2, one 4, one 7, one 8, and one 9 in my hand. Bidding 1 of any of these digits is a safe opening bid. I'll bid 1 1s as it's the lowest digit in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 1s. I have a 1 in my hand, so I know there is at least one 1 in total. I can increase the quantity or the digit to make a valid higher bid. Since I have a 1, bidding 2 1s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. I can either bid higher on 1s or choose a different digit. Bidding 3 1s is a safe option. Alternatively, I could bid on another digit I have, like 4s, but that might be riskier. Since I have two 1s, increasing the quantity to 3 feels like a reasonable and relatively safe move.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than this. I have one 1 in my hand, so I know there are at least 4 1s in total (3 from Player 0's bid history and 1 from my hand). I should bid higher than 3 1s, considering my hand and the possibility of higher digits. Bidding 4 2s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 2s is necessary. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 2s is possible, but might be risky. Increasing the digit seems safer. I have a 4, 7, 8, and 9 in my hand. Bidding 4 4s is a reasonable option as it's the next highest digit I have and keeps the quantity the same. Bidding 4 7s, 4 8s, or 4 9s are also options, but 4 4s seems most conservative and still increases the bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains 2 fours, so bidding a higher quantity or digit seems feasible. Since the current bid is 4 4s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I have a 4 in my hand, so bidding 5 4s or higher is possible. However, I also see that I have other digits that could potentially make a strong bid. I have two 4s, and I could try to bid on a digit that is higher than 4 or increase the quantity. I have one 5 which could make the bid 5 5s, but I also notice I have a 6, 7, and other digits that could influence my decision. A reasonable next bid could be to increase the quantity to 5 and stick with a digit higher than 4, like 5 5s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Bidding higher than 5 5s is risky without knowing what the other player has. Since I have a 4 in my hand, I can bid 6 4s. This increases the quantity and is a reasonable bid given my hand. Alternatively, challenging is an option, but 5 5s is not outrageously high. Increasing the bid seems better than immediately challenging.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. I have two 5s in my hand. Given that the current bid is 6 4s, I can increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 7 5s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and is supported by my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Given the previous bids, and the fact that my opponent has been increasing bids, it's plausible they have several 5s. However, 7 is a high number. I have one 4 in my hand. Bidding 8 4s would be a reasonable increase, and I have a 4 to contribute. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have one 8 and one 9. Bidding 2 8s or 2 9s would be too low to be a serious bid. So, increasing the 4s seems to be the best option.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 4s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. I have one 4 in my hand, so the total count of 4s could be 1 (from me) + ? (from Player 0). Without knowing Player 0's hand, I must make an educated guess. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider my own hand and try to make a bid that seems plausible but higher than the current one. My hand contains a 4, so bidding higher on a digit I have seems reasonable. I will bid 9 5s because I have a 5 and a 7 in my hand but no more 4s to add certainty.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. It's highly unlikely there are nine 5s in total. While I could attempt to bid higher, the probability of the current bid being true is very low. Therefore, challenging is the optimal strategy.
