Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a reasonable bid based on my hand. I have three 7s, so bidding 3 7s is a safe and strategic starting point.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which means there must be at least two more 7s in Player 0's hand. Given that I only have one 7, it's unlikely that Player 0 has two more 7s. However, I can increase the bid by raising the quantity to 4, assuming there might be another 7 in play. Alternatively, I could challenge, but since I don't have strong evidence to disprove the bid, I'll make a higher bid with a different digit that I have more of, like 4 3s, which increases both quantity and digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. The current bid is 4 3s. I can bid 5 3s, but I have three 7s, so I can bid 4 7s, which is a higher digit than 3s. This seems like a reasonable bid given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s, which means there must be at least three more 7s in Player 0's hand. Given that I only have one 7, it's unlikely that Player 0 has three more 7s, making the current bid questionable. I should challenge to verify the bid.
