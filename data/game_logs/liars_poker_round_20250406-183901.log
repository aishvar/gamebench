--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand '15035807', I have one '0', one '1', two '5's, one '3', one '8', one '7'. The strongest opening bid leverages the digit I have the most copies of, which is '5' with two occurrences. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is '2 5s', reflecting my own hand and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s. Bidding 2 8s is a higher bid because 8 is a higher digit than 5, and I have enough in my hand to support this bid.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 15035807, I have one 8. The current bid is 2 8s, which is plausible considering my one 8 and the opponent likely having at least one more. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the digit or the quantity. Since I don't have significant evidence of a high number of 8s, bidding 3 8s would be risky. However, I have two 0s in my hand, which makes a bid of 3 0s reasonable because it's likely the opponent has at least one 0, given the total of 16 digits. Therefore, I will raise the bid to 3 0s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s and two 8s in my hand, but no 0s. The current bid is 3 0s, and I cannot make a higher bid since I don't have three of any digit. Challenging is the only option, as I suspect the bid might be a bluff.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
