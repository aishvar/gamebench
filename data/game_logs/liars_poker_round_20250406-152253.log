Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open with an initial bid. Looking at my hand (92018262), I have two 2s, two 0s, two 8s, one 9, and one 1. The safest opening bid is typically 2 of a digit I have multiple of. I'll choose '2 2s' because I hold two 2s, making this bid conservative but reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have the hand 30850941, which contains one 2 (from the digit '2' in my hand, but there's no '2', actually there's one '2' is not present but there are other digits). Let's count: 3, 0, 8, 5, 0, 9, 4, 1 - there's one '0', no '2'. So, I have 0 twos. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 2s, and the quantity is low (2), it's reasonable to increase the quantity or the digit. I can see that there's at least one '0' in my hand. The total count of '0's could be 2 or more because my opponent might have '0's as well. So, I can bid 2 3s, increasing the digit. Alternatively, I could bid 3 2s. Let's analyze: bidding 2 3s is a safer move as it increases the digit and keeps the quantity the same, but I should consider if I have any information that could make a bid on a higher digit reasonable.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 9, 2, 0, 1, 8, 2, 6, 2. I have no 3s at all, so all 3s would have to be in Player 1's hand for the current bid of 2 3s to be valid. The probability that Player 1 has at least two 3s is relatively low (roughly 15% chance). Since the bid is still quite low and plausible, it is safer to increase the bid rather than challenge now. I will bid 2 4s, which is a higher digit with the same quantity, to keep the pressure on.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I don't have a lot of information about the other player's hand, I'll play it safe and bid on a higher digit. Bidding 2 5s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (92018262), I have two 2s, two 2s, one 0, one 1, one 8, and one 9. The current bid is 2 5s, and since I hold zero 5s, the likelihood that there are at least two 5s depends entirely on the opponent's hand. Given that, it's plausible Player 1 has two 5s or one 5 and is bluffing a bit. Rather than challenge a relatively low bid, I can safely raise. Since I have two 2s, bidding 3 2s is a reasonable and safe increase, as it only requires the opponent to have one 2 for the bid to be valid, which is quite likely.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 2S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have one 2 in my hand (from 30850941). The total count of 2s must be at least 3 (the bid quantity) or more for the bid to be valid. Since I have one 2, the other player must have at least 2 2s for the bid to be valid. It's possible but I need to consider the probability and the information from the bid history. The bid history shows a gradual increase in the digit, suggesting that the other player might be bidding based on some 2s. However, I also have other digits in my hand that could be used to make a higher bid. I can count my hand: 3 (0), 0 (1), 8 (2), 5 (3), 0 (4), 9 (5), 4 (6), 1 (7), 1 (8), 1 (9). I have a total of 1 '8' and 1 '9', and no other high digits in significant quantities. I can bid higher than 3 2s by bidding 3 3s or higher quantity with a lower or same digit. Since I have a '5', '8', and '9', I can consider bidding on a higher digit. Bidding 3 5s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and is based on my hand having a '5'.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 9, 2, 0, 1, 8, 2, 6, 2. Counting the 5s, I have zero. The current bid is 3 5s, which means my opponent is claiming there are at least three 5s combined. Since I hold none, all three would need to be in their hand, which is possible but somewhat unlikely. Looking at my hand, I have three 2s, so a bid of 4 2s would be a reasonable increase, as it only requires the opponent to have at least one 2, which is quite likely across 8 digits. Therefore, I will raise to 4 2s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have the hand 30850941, which contains two 2s (in positions 3 and 7, considering the first digit as position 0 for 3 and 1 for 0, etc.). This means there are at least two 2s in total because I have two of them. The bid history shows an escalating quantity and digit. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I see two 5s and one other digit that is higher than 2 in my hand, I can consider bidding on a higher digit or increasing the quantity. Bidding 4 3s or higher seems reasonable. However, I should be cautious not to overbid. I will bid 5 2s to increase the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 2S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 2s. The current bid is 5 2s, meaning there must be at least five 2s across both hands. Since I hold two, that requires the opponent to have at least three 2s, which is quite unlikely given the distribution of digits. The probability of one player holding three or more 2s is low, especially since I already have two. Therefore, I believe the opponent may be bluffing or overestimating the count, making a challenge the best move.
