Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 76278278, I have: 2 7s, 2 8s, 2 2s, 1 6. Since this is the first bid and I have 2 8s in my hand, starting with a conservative bid of 3 8s is reasonable. This leaves room for only 1 more 8 in the opponent's hand to make the bid valid, which is quite possible.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, meaning the opponent must have at least two 8s. With 16 total digits in play and only one 8 in my hand, the probability of the opponent holding exactly two 8s (to reach the bid total) is relatively low. Challenging now offers better odds of success than making a risky higher bid given the uncertainty about their hand.
