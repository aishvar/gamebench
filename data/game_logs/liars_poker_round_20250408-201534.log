Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 58684242, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Since I must raise, the easiest strictly higher bid is 1 1s. I have no 1s either, but statistically, there is likely at least one 1 across both hands. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I actually hold. I have two 2s, so bidding 2 2s is a strictly higher and safer bid based on my known hand. This leverages my information and increases the quantity, making it a solid strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 5, 8, 6, 8, 4, 2, 4, 2. There are no 3s at all, so the current bid of 2 3s relies entirely on Player 0 having both 3s, which is possible but somewhat unlikely. Since I have no 3s, I can't confidently increase the bid on 3s. However, I do have two 2s and two 8s, making those digits better candidates for a higher bid. The current bid is 2 3s, so a valid next bid could be 2 4s or 3 2s or 3 8s. Given I have two 8s, bidding 3 8s is a reasonable aggressive move, as Player 0 only needs to have one 8 for the bid to be plausible. Therefore, I will raise to 3 8s.
