Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a balanced hand with no obvious high or low digits. To start, I'll aim to bid on a digit that's likely to be high in quantity, but not too high to be impossible. The digit 0 is often high in quantity, so I'll bid on that.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 7, 1, 9, 2, 1, 8, 9, 5. I have zero 0s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s, meaning there must be at least three zeros among all 16 digits. Since I have none, all three zeros would need to be in Player 0's hand, which is somewhat unlikely but still plausible. Instead of challenging now, I can make a safe incremental bid by increasing the digit to a more probable one in my hand. I have two 9s, so bidding 3 9s (same quantity, higher digit) is reasonable and keeps the pressure on.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have a 9 in my hand. Bidding 4 9s is a reasonable move, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s. The current bid is 4 9s, so for that bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least two 9s as well. Given the distribution of digits, having four or more 9s across both hands is possible but somewhat unlikely. Since it requires the opponent to hold at least two 9s, and I already hold two, I think this is a good point to challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
