Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since I'm starting, I can choose any bid. Bidding 3 9s seems reasonable because it's a high digit and if the opponent has at least one 9, the total will be three or more, making my bid valid.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 8 and no 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s is not an option because it's not higher than 3 9s. I can either bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit (which is not possible with 9s). I will bid 4 0s, increasing the quantity, which is a valid and reasonable move given the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. Since I have no 0s in my hand, the opponent must have all four 0s if their bid is true. However, having four 0s is unlikely given the total of 16 digits. Challenging seems reasonable to test the validity of the bid.
