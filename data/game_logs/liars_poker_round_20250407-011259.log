Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start by bidding a safe and reasonable quantity. Bidding 2 6s is a solid move because I know I have two, making the bid valid regardless of the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand (90532438). For the bid to be true, Player 0 needs at least two 6s in their 8-digit hand. While I have none, needing two 6s is plausible for the opponent, making a challenge risky at this low quantity. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 3s. Bidding 3 3s is a valid higher bid (quantity increases from 2 to 3). This bid is supported by my hand, requiring Player 0 to have at least one 3 among their 8 digits, which is statistically likely. This seems like a reasonable and strategic next move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 3s in my hand, making it uncertain if Player 1's bid of 3 3s is valid. Challenging is a strategic move to test the likelihood of their bid being true.
