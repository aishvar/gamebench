Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I can start the bidding. I will bid a low quantity of a common digit to establish a baseline. I have two 8s in my hand, making '2 8' a reasonable initial bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 14395721, which contains zero 8s. The current bid is 2 8s, meaning the opponent claims there are at least two 8s combined. Since I have none, both 8s would need to be in Player 0â€™s hand, which is possible but somewhat unlikely given 8 digits. However, it's still plausible, so challenging now may be premature. Instead, I can make a safe higher bid on a digit I have more of. My hand has two 1s, two 1s is equal in quantity but lower digit, so invalid. Next, I have one 4, one 3, one 5, one 7, one 9, so no digit with more than two. To raise, I can bid 3 of any digit. Since I have two 1s, bidding 3 1s is a reasonable next bid, as the opponent might plausibly have one 1. This is a safe incremental raise.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. In my hand (59397088), I have no '1's. Thus, there are no '1's in my hand to contribute to the total. Given that I cannot support the current bid and considering the previous bids, it is likely that Player 1 is bluffing. Therefore, I will challenge the current bid.
