Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. My hand is 96126731. I have two 1s and two 6s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. There are 16 digits in total across both players. A reasonable opening bid should be statistically likely. Bidding '3 1s' is plausible because I hold two 1s, meaning the bid only requires the opponent to have at least one 1 among their 8 digits, which is statistically probable. This sets a reasonable starting point for the bidding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I can see my entire hand (70548218) which contains only one '1'. For the opponent's bid of '3 1s' to be true, they would need to have at least two '1s' in their hand since I only have one. While this is possible, it's not highly probable given a random distribution. With 8 digits, the expected frequency of any digit is less than 1, and having 2+ '1s' in a single hand is relatively uncommon. Additionally, this is their opening bid, which might be a strategic bluff. Based on probability and the early game state, challenging is the safer move than making a higher bid.
