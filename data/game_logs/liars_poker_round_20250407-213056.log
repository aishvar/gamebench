Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Starting with the first bid, I choose the digit '0' since I have two of them in my hand (40760378). Bidding '3 0' slightly exceeds my own count, making it plausible while leaving room for others to challenge or escalate. This balances aggression with caution, as the opponent might not have enough 0s to counter effectively.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 zeros. Looking at my hand (53823987), I have zero zeros. For the total number of zeros across both hands to be at least 3, the opponent would need at least 3 zeros in their hand. Since each player has 8 digits, it's statistically unlikely for the opponent to have 3 or more zeros alone, especially since I have none. The probability favors that there are fewer than 3 zeros total, making the current bid suspect. Therefore, the best move is to challenge the bid rather than risk making a higher, potentially invalid bid.
