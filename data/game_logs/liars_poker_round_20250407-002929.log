Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. I have two 3s and two 8s in my hand, which are the highest frequency digits. Bidding 2 8s seems reasonable as it's a safe starting point, allowing room for higher bids while also potentially bluffing about the actual count.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I don't have any 8s in my hand. It is still early in the game, so it is too risky to challenge. I can increase the bid to 3 9s, which is a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 9s. Since there are only 16 digits in total and I only have one 9, it's unlikely there are three 9s in total. I should challenge the bid.
