Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (59280480), I see multiple digits that could form a reasonable starting bid. The digit '8' appears twice, and '0' also appears twice. Bidding 2 8s seems like a safe and reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player also has at least one 8, making the total count of 8s at least 3, but I'll start conservatively.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, and Player 0 has bid '2 8s'. This means Player 0 likely has at least one 8. Given this, the current bid of '2 8s' seems plausible. However, I also have two 4s, making a total of at least two 4s in my hand alone, which makes it safer to bid '3 4s', as it increases the quantity and changes to a digit I have multiple of, thus improving my odds.

Player 1 bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 4s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. Since I only have two 4s, bidding 4 4s would be risky. Instead, I can bid 3 5s, increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity. This seems reasonable given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 64492318, containing digits: 6, 4, 4, 9, 2, 3, 1, and 8. I do not have any 5s myself. Player 0 has bid 3 5s, implying they might have some 5s. However, since I have no 5s, the bid of at least 3 5s relies entirely on Player 0's hand. Player 0 previously bid 2 8s, then raised to 3 5s after my bid of 3 4s. Without any evidence of 5s in my hand, it's risky to assume Player 0 has all three required 5s. Given this uncertainty, it is reasonable to challenge the current bid.
