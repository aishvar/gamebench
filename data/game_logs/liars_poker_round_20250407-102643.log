Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is 1 0s, and I already hold one, it's very likely there is at least one 0 in total. To increase the bid, I can either increase the digit or the quantity. I don't have any 9s, but I do have three 3s and two 0s, so a safe incremental bid would be 2 0s, which is a minimal raise and still plausible given my hand and the total digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 50013463, I have one '1'. The current bid is 2 1s, which is plausible since I have one and it's likely the opponent has at least one as well. To increase the bid, I can either bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I have two '0's, a safe incremental bid would be 3 0s, which is plausible given I hold two and the opponent likely has at least one. This raises the quantity and resets the digit to a value I have strong evidence for.
