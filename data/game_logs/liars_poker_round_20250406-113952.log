Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have three 5s and two 9s in my hand, I can make a conservative initial bid based on my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a safe starting point as I know at least three 5s exist in my own hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my hand contains a 0, 7, 7, 0, 2, 4, 0, 1, I have a total of 3 zeros. Given that the current bid is 3 5s, I can increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 4 0s seems reasonable as it's higher in quantity and based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. My hand is 94614765, which contains one 0. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have one 0, it's possible there are more 0s among the other players' hands, making a total of at least 4 0s plausible. However, bidding more than 4 0s seems challenging. I can bid 4 1s, which is a higher digit than 0 with the same quantity.

Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 1s. Since I have a strong hand with multiple 5s, it's reasonable to increase the bid on 5s. Bidding 5 5s increases the quantity based on my hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I need to make a higher bid than this. I have one 5 in my hand, but bidding higher than 5 requires me to have additional information or make an educated guess. Since I don't have a clear count of other players' hands, I should consider increasing either the quantity or the digit. Given that I have one 5, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. The digit 5 is already being bid at a high quantity, so I should consider bidding on a different digit that I have in my hand or a higher quantity if I think it's likely others have it too. My hand contains 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 2, 4, 0 - I have three 0s which seems like a good opportunity.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Given that there are 24 digits in total and the bid is already quite high, I should consider the possibility of there being at least 5 fives in total. However, I also have to think about the digits I hold and the potential for others to have higher digits. My hand contains 0, 7, 7, 0, 2, 4, 0, 1. I don't have many high digits but I do have multiple 0s which could be useful in future bids. Since I have one 5, and without exact knowledge of others' hands, bidding slightly higher seems reasonable. I will bid 6 0s as it's a low digit but increases the quantity slightly.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. My hand is 94614765, which contains one 0. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since there are 8 digits per player and 3 players, the total number of digits is 24. The current bid of 6 0s implies that there are at least 6 zeros across all hands. I have one 0, so the remaining players must have at least 5 zeros between them. Bidding 7 0s would be a slight increase in quantity. However, I can also consider bidding on a higher digit. I see that I have no 9s, one 4, two 6s, two 7s, and other digits. Bidding on a higher digit like 7s or 6s with the same quantity (6) could be reasonable if I had more of those digits or thought others might. Given my hand, I have two 6s and two 7s. Bidding 6 7s seems plausible as it increases the digit. Alternatively, bidding 7 0s is also an option as it increases the quantity. I will choose to bid 7 0s as it directly increases the quantity, making it a stronger bid if the previous bidder was accurate about the number of 0s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 7 0s, which means the other two players would need to have at least 6 0s combined. Given that 0s are less common and the bid history shows a rapid escalation in quantity without much support from other digits, it's unlikely that there are 7 0s in total. Challenging seems like the best move.
