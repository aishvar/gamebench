Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, two 3s, two 5s, one 2, one 7, and one 9. A safe opening bid is usually 2 of a digit I have multiples of. I'll start with 2 6s, as I have two of them, and it's a reasonable conservative bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s and one 7. The current bid is 2 7s, which is plausible since I alone have one 7, so the opponent likely has at least one. To make a safe higher bid, I can increase the quantity or digit. I don't have enough 7s to confidently bid 3 7s. However, since I have two 6s, and the opponent might have at least one 6, bidding 3 6s is reasonable and raises the quantity, making it a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s and two 6s. The current bid is 3 7s, which is plausible given my two 7s and the possibility that Player 1 has at least one. To avoid risking a challenge on a likely valid bid, I should raise. The safest next bid is 3 8s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity, as I have one 8, making it plausible. Alternatively, I could bid 4 6s since I hold two 6s, but this is riskier. Given the options, 3 8s is a reasonable conservative raise.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 3 9s, which requires at least two more 9s in Player 1's hand. Since each player only has 8 digits, the probability that Player 1 holds at least two 9s is relatively low, especially given no prior bids on 9s before their jump to 3 9s. This sudden escalation suggests a bluff or overestimation. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move.
