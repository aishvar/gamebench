Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, two 4s, two 5s, one 7, one 1, and one 9. A conservative yet reasonable opening bid is 2 6s, as I hold two myself, and statistically, the opponent may have one or none, making this a safe and credible opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7. The current bid is 2 7s, which means the opponent claims there are at least two 7s total. Since I only have one, it's plausible they have one or more 7s. Bidding 3 7s would be risky without more evidence. However, I have two 6s, which supports a higher bid on 6s. Since the previous bid was 2 7s, I can increase the quantity to 3 and revert to a digit I have a strong count in. Therefore, bidding 3 6s is a safe, valid, and strategic increase.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7. The current bid is 3 7s, which would require the opponent to have at least two 7s. Given that distribution, it's plausible but risky to assume more than 3 sevens exist. Instead of challenging, I can make a safe higher bid by increasing the digit at the same quantity. I have two 6s, and the last bid of 3 6s was already made, so the next valid higher bid would be 3 8s or increasing the quantity. Since I don't have many 8s or 9s, a safer approach is to increase the quantity on a digit I have multiple of. I have two 6s and two 4s. I will bid 4 6s, leveraging my strong count in 6s, which is a reasonable and safe higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7. The opponent's bid of 4 7s implies there are at least three more 7s in their hand, which is somewhat unlikely but possible. Since a total of 4 7s is plausible, challenging might be risky. I also have two 6s, so increasing the bid on 6s to 5 6s is a safer strategic move, as it raises the quantity and re-centers the bid on a digit I hold more of.
