Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can make the first bid. My hand contains the digits 8, 4, 8, 7, 5, 2, 1, 5. I notice that I have two 8s and two 5s. A reasonable starting bid could be related to one of these digits. Bidding 6 5s seems like a safe and reasonable initial bid because it's a relatively high quantity for a digit that appears twice in my hand, but not so high as to be easily challenged given the total of 24 digits across all players.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '6 5s' and decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge. In my hand (29959030), I have one 5, which means there would need to be at least 5 more 5s between the other two players' hands to make the current bid valid. Each player has 8 digits, so there are 24 total digits in play. The probability of having 6 or more 5s out of 24 digits is reasonable (roughly 22% chance if digits were randomly distributed). Since I have only one 5, I'll bid higher rather than challenge. I could bid '7 5s', but that might be pushing my luck. Instead, I'll move to a digit I have more of in my hand. I have two 9s, so I'll bid '6 9s', keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that this bid can be beaten. My hand contains the digits 9, 2, 3, 1, 6, 8, 7, and 5. I have one 9, which could contribute to the count but not enough to guarantee a win if I bid higher on 9s. I should consider if there's a higher digit I can bid on or increase the quantity. Since I have one 9 and the bid is already quite high, I should think about bidding on a different digit or increasing the quantity significantly if I have multiple digits that could add up.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. I need to make a bid that is higher than this. My hand is 84875215, which contains no 0s. The total count of 0s across all players is at least 7 because the current bid is 7 0s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have no information about the other players' hands, I'll focus on the digits I have. I have multiple digits, but none of them are in high count in my hand except for 8 (2 counts). However, bidding on 8s might not be the best strategy without knowing others' hands. The next highest digit after 0 is 1, but I only have one 1. I can bid on a higher digit than 0 with the same quantity (7) or increase the quantity. The next possible bid with the same quantity (7) would be 7 1s. I have one 1, so it's possible that others have 6 or more 1s. Increasing the quantity to 8 is also an option, and I can bid 8 0s or 8 1s. Given that I have one 1 and it's likely others might have 1s as well, bidding 7 1s seems reasonable. It's a bit of a gamble but it's a valid bid that is higher than 7 0s.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 7 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (29959030), I have zero 1s. The current bid is 7 1s. With 24 total digits in play and none of them 1s in my hand, there would need to be 7 1s among the other 16 digits held by the other players. While possible, this seems somewhat unlikely. However, I don't want to challenge yet since 7 out of 24 digits (29%) isn't extremely improbable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding on 9s gives me some confidence. I'll bid 8 0s since I have two 0s in my hand as well, which is a safer quantity increase than bidding on 9s.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 0s. Given that there are 24 digits in total and 8 0s have already been bid, I need to assess the likelihood of there being 8 or more 0s in total. My hand contains one 0, and I know that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. I also consider that the previous bids have been relatively conservative. Since I have a 0 in my hand and the bid history suggests that players have been trying to increase the quantity or digit gradually, I should consider if there's a high likelihood that there are indeed 8 or more 0s. However, without knowing the exact distribution of digits in other players' hands, I must make an educated guess. Given that I have one 0 and the bid is already at 8, I think it's reasonable to challenge if I believe the count of 0s is likely lower than 8, or make a higher bid if I think it's plausible. I will challenge because 8 0s seems unlikely given the digits I can see and my own hand.
