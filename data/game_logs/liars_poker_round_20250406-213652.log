Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. As the first player, I choose to bid 3 9s, assuming the other player has at least one 9, making the total count 3.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have two 5s and two 3s in my hand. Since I have no 9s, I cannot confidently bid higher on 9s. However, I can bid on the 5s or 3s. Bidding 4 5s or 4 3s is a reasonable move, as it increases the quantity from the current bid of 3 9s. Since I have two 5s, bidding 4 5s seems like a good strategy.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand, so the total number of 5s is at least one. Bidding higher would require a risky assumption, so challenging is a better move given the likelihood that the total count is less than four.
