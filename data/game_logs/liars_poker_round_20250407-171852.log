Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two '4's in my hand, I can start with a conservative bid that is likely to be true based on my hand. Bidding 'BID: 2 4' is a safe starting point as it reflects the count in my hand, and the opponent may have additional '4's, making this a plausible bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 4s'. I have one '4' in my hand (98427660). For the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) needs to have at least one '4' in their 8-digit hand. This is statistically quite likely (expected value is 0.8 fours in 8 digits). Therefore, challenging the bid '2 4s' is risky and likely to fail. I should look for a higher bid. I need to bid higher than '2 4s', either by increasing the quantity or the digit. Looking at my hand, I have two '6's. Bidding '2 6s' is higher than '2 4s' (same quantity, higher digit). Since I hold two '6's myself, this bid is guaranteed to be true based on my hand alone, regardless of the opponent's hand. This is a safe and strategically sound move that increases the bid value.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains no 6s, and the current bid is 2 6s. Since there are 16 digits in total (8 per player), the maximum possible 6s is 16. However, given that I have none, it's unlikely that Player 1 has exactly 2 6s in their hand. Challenging seems reasonable here.
