--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 5, one 6, one 8, and two 9s. A safe and informative opening bid is usually 2 of a digit I have at least one or two of. Given I have two 9s, bidding '2 9s' is a strong start based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s (digits: 86739139), which already matches the current bid of '2 9s' by Player 0. Given that the other player likely has at least one 9, it's safe to increase the bid slightly. I'll bid '3 9s' because it's a minimal increase and still highly plausible.

Player 1 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 3 9s, which would require that the opponent has at least two 9s. Since each player has 8 digits, having three or more 9s total is plausible but somewhat risky. Making a higher bid would require bidding 4 of any digit or 3 of a digit higher than 9, which is impossible. Given that, and my limited count of 9s, I suspect the opponent may be bluffing or overestimating. Therefore, challenging is the best strategic move.
