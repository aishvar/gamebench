Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. I'll start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 5s, so bidding 2 5s seems like a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 5s, which slightly reduces the likelihood of the current bid being valid. However, with 24 digits in play and only a bid of 2 5s, it's quite likely that among the other 16 digits held by Players 0 and 2, there are at least two 5s. Therefore, challenging now would be premature. To make a legal higher bid, I can increase the quantity or keep it the same and increase the digit. Since I have two 0s and two 4s, bidding 2 6s or 2 7s would not be strategic. Instead, I will raise the quantity to 3 and pick a digit I have multiples of, like 4, to base my bid on. I have two 4s, so bidding 3 4s is a reasonable incremental raise.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s and one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand. I could also challenge, but I have a 4 in my hand, so it's likely that the bid is valid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Given that the bid history has been increasing, I should consider if I can make a valid higher bid or challenge. Since my hand contains one 6, and assuming others might have a few 6s as well, bidding higher seems risky without knowing others' hands. However, I can see that the digit 6 was just bid, so challenging seems like a reasonable option if I suspect the bid might be too high to be true, considering the total possible digits is 24 and previous bids.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) challenges Player 2's (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bid of 4 6s.
