Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make a bid to start the game. Given my hand, I have 2 1s, 2 2s, 2 3s, and 2 4s. The most promising digit to bid on is 4, as it's the highest quantity I have. I should bid 4 4s.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. I can see that bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit could be advantageous. Since I have a few digits in my hand that could contribute to a higher count, I should consider bidding something that seems plausible given my hand and the goal to make a higher bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 6 4s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 9, 3, 5, 6, 8, 4, 7, 6. I have two 6s and one 4. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and the current bid is 6 4s, I should consider if I can reasonably make a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent. Since I have two 6s and the bid must be higher than 6 4s, I can bid higher than 6. Considering the digits I have, bidding 7 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have one 6 in my hand, but I also have a 2, a 5, and a 0, which are not represented in the current bid. I should make a bid that increases the quantity or digit to reflect my hand's potential.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 8 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are 8 secret digits per player, I should consider the possibility of there being 8 or more 6s in total. However, I also need to consider the likelihood of Player 0 having 8 or more 6s. Since I only have one 6, I will challenge the bid as it seems unlikely that there are 8 or more 6s in total.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) challenges Player 0's (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bid of 8 6s.
Revealed Hands: P0(meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor):91243200 | P1(meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor):93568476
Actual count of 6s across all hands: 2
Challenge Successful! Actual count (2) < Bid quantity (8).
