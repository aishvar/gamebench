Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the opening bid, so I want to start with a conservative yet reasonable bid. In my hand, I have two 1s (digits: 1,5,3,1,9,4,1,3). Since there are 16 digits total, and 1s tend to appear frequently, a starting bid of 3 1s is modest and likely to be safe.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 1s. Since I only have one 1, it's unlikely there are three 1s in total. However, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity to 4 and choosing a digit I have multiple of, such as 4s. I have two 4s in my hand, making this bid plausible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 4S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 15319413, I have no 4s at all. Since there are 8 digits in my opponent's hand, for their bid of 4 4s to be valid, there must be at least 4 total 4s. Given I have zero, my opponent would need to hold all 4 or more 4s, which is quite unlikely statistically. The expected count per digit across 16 digits is about 1.6, so 4 of a single digit concentrated in one hand is rare. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
