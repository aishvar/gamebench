Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (53419647), the digit '4' appears once, which is a reasonable starting point. Bidding 1 4s is a safe initial move.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding 2 4s is a valid option. Alternatively, I could bid on a different number. I have two 0s, one 1, two 2s and one 6. Bidding 2 0s is a reasonable increase, as it's a higher quantity than 1 4s. Bidding 1 5s, 1 6s, 1 1s or 1 2s are also valid. However, since I only have one 4, and the opponent could have more, I'll try to increase the quantity of a digit I have more of. I have two 0s, so bidding 2 0s seems like a good move.

Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 2 0s, which is possible if the opponent also has one 0. However, since the bid is low, I can safely increase it by bidding a higher digit that I have, such as 5s, which I have one of. Bidding 2 5s is a safe increase.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Considering the previous bids (1 4s, 2 0s, 2 5s), the game seems to be escalating slowly. Bidding 3 5s would be a reasonable increase, but given that I have no 5s, it's more strategic to challenge the bid. If the count is less than 2, I win. If the count is 2 or more, I lose, but I've gained information about the opponent's hand.
