Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 4s, and one each of 9, 3, 6, and 2. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 7s, reflecting the two 7s I have, which also pressures the opponent to either raise or challenge with limited information.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. My hand is 11154835. I have zero 7s, meaning the opponent needs at least two 7s for their bid to be true. While possible, challenging such a low bid is risky. I should look for a higher bid based on my hand. I have three 1s. Bidding '3 1s' is a strong move because I already possess the required quantity myself, making it highly likely to be true. This increases the quantity from the previous bid and utilizes the strength of my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 7s (digits: 9,7,3,7,6,4,4,2). The current bid is 3 1s, which is quite low-risk and likely plausible, given 16 digits total. Since I have two 7s, a natural and safe progression is to raise the bid to 3 7s, which is a strictly higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This is a reasonable move that leverages my known hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 11154835. The current bid is 3 7s, made by Player 0. I have zero 7s in my hand. For the bid to be true, Player 0 must have at least three 7s. Player 0 previously bid 2 7s and then raised to 3 7s after my bid of 3 1s, suggesting they might actually hold 7s, making a challenge risky. I need to make a bid higher than 3 7s. I have three 1s in my hand. Bidding 4 1s is a strong move based on my hand. It increases the quantity and only requires Player 0 to have one 1 among their 8 digits for the bid to potentially be true, which is statistically plausible. This seems safer than challenging or bidding higher on a digit I have fewer of.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 1s, making the likelihood of there being at least four 1s across both hands quite low. Since I hold 8 digits with zero 1s, the opponent would need to have all four or more 1s in their hand, which is improbable. Therefore, it's a good opportunity to challenge the current bid of 4 1s.
