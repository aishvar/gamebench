Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can safely start with a bid of 2 5s. This bid is guaranteed to be valid because my own hand already contains two 5s, ensuring the total count across all players is at least 2. This forces the opponent to make a higher bid or challenge (which would fail).

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 5. The current bid is 2 5s, which is plausible since the opponent could easily have at least one more 5. Challenging at this stage would be risky. To make a higher bid, I look for digits where I have strong presence. I have two 3s and two 8s, which supports a safe increase. The minimal valid next bid is 2 6s (since digit goes up from 5 to 6 at same quantity), but I can make a stronger positional bid. Given two 8s in my hand, bidding 3 8s is a reasonable and safe escalation.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The opponent bid 3 8s, meaning they need at least two 8s in their hand. Statistically, the probability of them having two or more 8s is low (~18.6%), given the random distribution of digits. Since a challenge would succeed if they have â‰¤1 8 (81.4% chance), challenging is favorable here.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) challenges Player 1's (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bid of 3 8s.
