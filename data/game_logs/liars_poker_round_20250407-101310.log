Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. My hand contains two 8s, two 8s, two 8s, and two 8s. The most common digit in my hand is '8' with three occurrences. Opening with a conservative and reasonable bid of 3 8s leverages my strong position and sets a solid baseline.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 78618895, I have two 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, so for that bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least one 9. Given there are 8 digits in their hand, having one or more 9s is plausible. Bidding 4 9s would be risky, as it would require them to have at least two 9s, which is less likely. Alternatively, I can increase the digit with the same quantity. Looking at my hand, I have three 8s (digits: 8, 8, 8). Since the current bid was previously 3 8s, I cannot bid that again, but I can increase the quantity to 4 8s, supported by my three 8s and hoping the opponent has at least one 8, which is quite probable. Therefore, a bid of 4 8s is a reasonable strategic move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s. The current bid is 4 9s, which would require my opponent to have at least two more 9s. Given that there are only 8 digits in their hand, having 4 or more 9s total is somewhat unlikely but possible. However, since I have two 8s as well, raising the bid to 4 9s is risky, but I can safely increase the digit to 5 8s, which is the next valid higher bid by quantity, leveraging my two 8s. This keeps pressure on the opponent and is more plausible than 5 9s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s (digits: 7,8,6,1,8,8,9,5). The current bid is 5 9s, meaning there must be at least five 9s across both hands. Since I hold only two, the opponent would need at least three 9s, which is somewhat unlikely but still possible. However, pushing the bid further to 6 9s would require the opponent to have at least four 9s, which is very improbable given 8 digits per player. It is also risky to switch to a lower digit or increase the quantity with a different digit, as I don't have a strong count of any other digit. Therefore, the best strategic move is to challenge the current bid of 5 9s.
