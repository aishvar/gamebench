Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make a valid opening bid. I have two 4s and one 2, which gives me a reasonable count to start with. I can bid 2 4s, as it is a strong bid that reflects my hand while remaining within the rules of the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 4s, but I do have two 7s, two 9s, one 5, one 3, and two 6s. The current bid is 2 4s, which is quite low, and since I hold no 4s, it's plausible Player 0 has two or more 4s. Rather than challenge a low and likely true bid, I should increase the bid. The best move is to raise the quantity to 3 of a digit I have multiple of. I hold two 6s and two 7s, so bidding 3 6s is a safe and incremental raise, leveraging my known cards to support the bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which means there are at least 5 6s in total since the current bid is 3 6s. I can increase the quantity and still have a reasonable chance of being correct. Therefore, I will bid 4 6s.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which means Player 0 is likely relying on at least two more 6s in their hand to support their bid of 4 6s. The probability that there are four or more 6s total is plausible, but pushing the bid higher on 6s without strong evidence would be risky. Instead, I can increase the bid by keeping the quantity the same but moving to a higher digit where I have a decent count. I have two 7s, so bidding 4 7s increases the digit while maintaining the quantity, putting pressure back on Player 0.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s and one 0 in my hand, but I do not have any 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, which seems quite high given that I have no 7s. Since I cannot make a valid higher bid and the likelihood of there being 4 or more 7s seems low, I will challenge the current bid.
