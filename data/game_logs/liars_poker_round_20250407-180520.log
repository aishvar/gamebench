Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first move of the game, so I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand (60927979), I have three 9s, two 7s, one 6, one 0, and one 2. Since 9s are the most frequent in my hand (3 of them), they're a good starting point. I'll bid 3 nines, which means I'm claiming there are at least 3 nines between both players' hands. Since I already have 3 nines in my hand, this is a safe opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 55045648. I have zero 9s. The current bid is '3 9s'. For this bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least three 9s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively low (approximately 3.8%). Since I hold none of the bid digit, the burden falls entirely on the opponent's hand, making the bid highly suspect. Therefore, challenging is the statistically advantageous move.
