Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 8, and two occurrences of the digit 0. Starting conservatively, a typical opening bid is 2 of a common digit. Given I have two 0s, bidding 2 0s is safe and reasonable.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 61917847. I have zero 0s, two 1s, one 4, one 6, two 7s, one 8, and one 9. The current bid is 2 0s. Challenging this low opening bid is risky, as the opponent could easily have two 0s. I need to make a higher bid. Options include bidding 2 1s (or any higher digit) or bidding 3 of any digit. I have two 1s and two 7s. Bidding 3 1s is a plausible next step. It's higher than 2 0s (quantity increase). It leverages my possession of two 1s, only requiring the opponent to have one 1, which is statistically likely (roughly 57% chance they have at least one 1 in their 8 digits). This seems like a reasonable escalation based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 20850362, which contains zero 1s. Since the current bid is 3 1s and I have none, all three 1s would have to be in Player 1's hand. Given that they have only 8 digits, it's unlikely they have exactly three or more 1s. Therefore, the bid of 3 1s is quite risky and likely an overstatement, making it a good opportunity to challenge.
