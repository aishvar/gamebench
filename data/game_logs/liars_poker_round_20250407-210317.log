Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. In my hand, I have one '0'. Since Player 0 is a naive 50/50 player, they are likely bidding conservatively, assuming an even distribution of digits. Given that there are 16 digits in total across both hands and I already know there is at least one '0' (from my hand), it is highly probable that there are more than one '0' across both hands. Therefore, I can safely make a higher bid to maintain control of the game and push the bidding forward.
