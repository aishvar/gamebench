Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid. My hand contains the digits 2, 7, 0, 6, 8, 8, 0, 1. I see that I have two 0s, two 8s, and two other digits. A reasonable starting bid could be 2 0s given that I have two 0s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, which makes it unlikely that there are significantly more 0s in total. However, the current bid of 2 0s is very low and plausible, so challenging it would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have two 4s in my hand, which makes it reasonable to bid 3 4s, increasing both the quantity and changing the digit to something I have evidence for.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 6s, and I know there are 16 digits in total. I can see if I increase the quantity or the digit, I might have a chance. Since I have two 6s, bidding 3 or more 6s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit compared to 3 4s.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 6s. Based on my hand, it is plausible that there are additional 6s in Player 0's hand, but it is also risky to assume there are at least 4 in total without stronger evidence. To avoid challenging too early and to maintain pressure, I will increase the bid to 5 6s, as it is a logical progression and still leaves room for further play.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, and the previous bid was 4 6s from me. Given that my hand contains two 6s and I know there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's, the total count of 6s could be higher but not extremely high. Since I already have two 6s, I will try to increase the quantity to make a valid higher bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s. The current bid is 6 6s. Based on my hand, it is plausible that there could be at least six 6s across both hands, but it is risky to assume there are significantly more. To avoid challenging prematurely and to stay in the game, I will make a higher bid by increasing the quantity to 7 6s, which is a reasonable escalation given my hand and the current bid.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 7 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, and the total count of 6s so far is 4 (from my previous bids and the current bid). If I bid 8 6s, it would be a valid higher quantity. However, considering the possibility of Player 1 having more 6s, I should assess the likelihood of them having more than 3 6s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are 8 digits in each player's hand, I should consider if there's a more likely digit to be higher in quantity. Since 6 is already a high quantity and bid, I should consider challenging or bidding conservatively. But first, let's evaluate if there's a likely digit that could have a higher count than 6s and if I can make a reasonable bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 8 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. In my hand, I have two 6s. Assuming an even distribution of digits across both players, it is plausible that there are additional 6s in Player 0's hand, but 8 is already a high quantity. Further increasing the bid to 9 6s would be risky since the total maximum count of any digit is 16, and I have limited information about Player 0's hand. However, challenging the bid also carries a risk, as Player 0 might have enough 6s to meet the bid. Given the high likelihood that 8 6s could be achievable, I will escalate the bid slightly to maintain the pressure and avoid challenging prematurely.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 6S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 9 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 6s. I have 2 sixes in my hand, which means there are at least 2 sixes in total. Given that the previous bids have been quite high and my own previous bids have not added much new information, I should consider if there's a possibility that the total count of 6s is indeed 9 or higher. However, since I have two 6s and the bid history has been steadily increasing, I should think about making a higher bid or challenging. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. Given that there are 8 digits in each player's hand and there are 2 players, the maximum possible count for any digit is 16. The current bid of 9 6s seems high but I only have 2 sixes. I should consider bidding higher or challenging. Since I have two 6s and the bid is 9 6s, I should think about if there's a digit that could reasonably be higher than 6 and if I have enough of that digit to make a credible bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 7S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 10 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 7s. In my hand, I have one 7. For the bid to be valid, there must be at least 10 sevens across both hands. Given the total of 16 digits between the two players, it is highly unlikely that over 60% of all digits are 7s. Additionally, the bidding history shows a steady progression of increasing bids, suggesting Player 0 may be bluffing to force a challenge. Based on the improbability of 10 7s being present, I should challenge this bid.
