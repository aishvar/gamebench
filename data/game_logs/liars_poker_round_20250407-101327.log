Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 3, one 7, one 2, one 9, one 5, one 6, one 8, and one 0 â€” all digits appear exactly once. The safest opening bid is 2 of a digit I have, as it's likely at least one more exists in the opponent's hand. I will start with '2 8s' because 8 is a mid-range digit and I have one 8 myself, making it a reasonable conservative opening bid.
