Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. Since this is the first bid, I can start with a low quantity on a high digit to set a safe and strategic foundation. Bidding 1 9s is a reasonable and believable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 1 9s, which is a very low bid. Since I know there is at least one 9 (mine), it's reasonable to increase the bid slightly to test the opponent's hand. I'll bid 2 9s, which is a safe increase based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 9s. Considering the opponent raised from 1 to 2, they might have at least one 9, making the total two. Challenging this bid could be risky if the total is exactly two, but if the opponent has none, I win. Given the uncertainty, challenging seems like the best move to test the opponent's confidence.
