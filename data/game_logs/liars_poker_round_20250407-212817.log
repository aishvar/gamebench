Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I can choose any digit and quantity. Observing my hand, the digit '7' appears twice, and the digit '9' also appears twice. However, the most frequent digit in my hand is not immediately clear without counting all digits. To start conservatively and gather information, I'll bid on the digit '7' with a quantity of 2, knowing it's a safe and valid starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 sevens. Looking at my hand (37604482), I have exactly one 7. For Player 0's bid of 2 sevens to be true, they must have at least one 7. Since it's quite plausible they have at least one 7 among their 8 digits, the bid of 2 sevens is reasonable. Challenging now is risky. The next minimum valid bid would be either increasing the quantity to 3 sevens, which is unlikely (since I only have one), or bidding 2 eights, as I have two eights in my hand. This is a safe and strategic higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. My hand contains 2 8s, which matches the bid exactly. Since I cannot bid the same quantity and digit, I must either bid a higher quantity of 8s (not possible with my hand) or bid a higher digit. The next highest digit I have is 9, and I have 2 9s. Therefore, I can validly bid 2 9s, which exceeds the current bid in digit value.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 3, 7, 6, 0, 4, 4, 8, 2, which has zero 9s. The current bid is 2 9s, meaning there must be at least two 9s between both hands. Since I have none, Player 0 must have both 9s for the bid to be valid, which is possible but somewhat unlikely. Given the previous bids (2 7s, 2 8s, then 2 9s), Player 0 might be trying to push the bid upwards without necessarily having strong evidence. Since I have no 9s, and two 9s in their hand is a stretch, the probability favors a challenge here rather than risking a higher bid.
