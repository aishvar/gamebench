Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, two 4s, two 3s, one 7, and one 9. A conservative opening bid is typically 2 of a digit I have multiples of. Bidding '2 6s' leverages the two 6s in my hand and is a reasonable opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (00281381). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have one 6, it's plausible that there are at least two 6s in total. I can bid 2 7s, which is a higher digit and thus a valid bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s, which is plausible given I hold one and the opponent could have at least one as well. Since I cannot challenge my own previous bid and must raise, a natural and safe escalation is to increase the quantity. I don't have enough information to confidently challenge yet. Therefore, I will bid 3 7s, which is a minimal increase and keeps pressure on the opponent.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 00281381, which means I have 0 7s. The current bid is 3 7s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have any 7s, it's likely that the total count of 7s is less than 3, making the bid of 3 7s potentially challenging. However, my task is to make a move based on the current bid. I can bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Bidding 3 8s is a valid move as it increases the digit. I have one 8 in my hand, so it's possible there are at least 3 8s in total.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 7, 4, 6, 6, 4, 9, 3, 6. I have zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, meaning there must be at least three 8s between both hands. Since I have none, my opponent would need to have all three 8s, which is quite unlikely given only 8 digits per player. The prior bids increased from 2 6s and 2 7s to 3 7s, then 3 8s, likely bluffing or pushing the count. It's improbable the opponent has 3 or more 8s alone, so I will challenge.
