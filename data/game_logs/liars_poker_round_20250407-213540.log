Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 7s, one 0, one 5, one 1, and one 9. The most frequent digits in my hand are 2 and 7, each appearing twice. Statistically, it's safest to open with a bid on one of these digits. An opening bid of 2 is reasonable, as it's likely there are at least a few more of these digits in the opponent's hand, making the total count at least 3 or more. Therefore, I'll open with a conservative but solid bid of 3 of the digit 2.
