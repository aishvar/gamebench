Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. My hand is 92844967. I have two 9s and two 4s, which are my most frequent digits. There are 16 total digits in play (8 for me, 8 for the opponent). On average, there should be 1.6 of each digit across all hands (16/10). Having two 9s is slightly above average. A bid of '3 9s' requires the opponent to have at least one 9. The probability of the opponent having at least one 9 out of their 8 unknown digits is reasonably high (1 - (9/10)^8 â‰ˆ 57%). This seems like a solid opening bid, leveraging my hand without being overly aggressive.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand (21748315). The current bid is 3 9s. Since I have no 9s, it's possible that Player 0 has all 3 9s in their hand, but this seems unlikely given the distribution of digits. Challenging now seems like a reasonable move to call their bluff.
