Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. To make a valid bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I will increase the quantity to 4. Since I have two 2s in my hand, I'll bid 4 2s. This is safer than bidding on a digit I don't have.
