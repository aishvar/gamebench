Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 2s, one 9, one 5, one 0, and one 7. The most common digits in my hand are 8s and 2s, each appearing twice. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 8s, reflecting my own hand's strength and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. The bid is reasonable given that there are 8 digits per player and it's possible the other player has at least two 8s. However, I can bid higher. I'll increase the quantity to 3 and keep the digit the same, making it 3 8s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 89250827, I have two 8s. For the current bid of 3 8s to be valid, the opponent must have at least one 8. Given that, it's plausible. A bid of 4 8s would require the opponent to have at least two 8s, which is less likely but still possible. Alternatively, I can increase the digit with the same quantity. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s as well, so bidding 3 9s (I have one 9) or 3 2s is risky. I also have one 9, one 5, and one 0, but not enough to confidently increase those. The safest strategic move is to raise the quantity on 8s to 4 8s, leveraging my two 8s and pressuring the opponent.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I can see my own hand: 39834145. It contains one 8. Assuming the opponent's hand is random, they likely have some 8s as well. The total count of 8s must be at least 1 (mine) and at most 8 (if the opponent has 7). The current bid of 4 8s is plausible but on the higher side. However, given that the opponent bid 2 8s, then 3 8s, and then 4 8s, it suggests they might have a reasonable number of 8s. I need to either challenge or make a slightly higher bid. Bidding 4 9s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 89250827, I have one 9 and two 8s. The current bid is 4 9s, which requires at least four 9s across both hands. Since I hold only one 9, the opponent would need to have at least three 9s for the bid to be valid. Given that each player has 8 digits, it is statistically unlikely that the opponent holds three or more 9s. Therefore, challenging this bid is the best move.
