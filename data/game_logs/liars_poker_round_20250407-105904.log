Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have several digits with high frequencies, specifically 3, 6, and 8. Since the current bid is 'None', I can start by bidding on a digit with a high frequency in my hand. I'll choose 3, as it appears three times in my hand, and bid a quantity of 3.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. I have two 3s in my hand, but I also have other digits that could be used to make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 3 3s, I should either increase the quantity or the digit. I have one 5 in my hand, and bidding 3 4s or higher seems reasonable if I consider increasing the digit. However, I should also consider if I can increase the quantity based on my available digits.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. Considering my hand, I have two 3s, which is less than the bid quantity. However, I also have a 4, 6, and 8. I can make a valid higher bid by increasing the digit to 6 or 8. Since I have a 6, bidding 4 6s seems reasonable and increases the digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more likely to succeed. My hand contains 2 sixes (6s appear twice). Given that the previous bid was 4 6s and I have two 6s, I could potentially increase the quantity or the digit. However, I should also consider the total number of digits and their distribution. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should look for a digit that appears frequently in my hand or a quantity that seems achievable. My hand contains two 6s, and I see no reason to doubt that there could be more 6s or other high digits in Player 0's hand. I also notice that I have one 7, one 8, and one 9, but no other digits appear more than twice. A safe bet seems to be increasing the quantity or digit slightly, considering my hand and the possibility of others having similar or higher digits.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. I can make a valid higher bid by increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand, so I'll bid 6 6s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have knowledge of my own hand which contains one 6 and one 0, and no information about Player 0's hand. The bid history shows increasing confidence in higher digits and quantities. Given that I have one 6, I should consider if I can reasonably increase the bid. Since my hand contains one 6, I know that there are at least 7 sixes in total (6 from the bid history + 1 from my hand). I also have a 0 in my hand, but bidding with a 0 would not be strategic as it's lower than 6. I will increase the quantity slightly and bid on a digit that I have in my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 8 6s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 8 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. I need to analyze my hand and the bid history. My hand contains the digits: 4, 7, 9, 0, 5, 0, 0, 1. I have a total of 3 zeros, 2 fives, and 1 seven, and one 6. Given that the bid is 8 6s, I have to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since I only have one 6 and the bid is already quite high at 8 6s, I should consider if there's a possibility that the previous player has more 6s than they claim or if I can make a reasonable bid. The bid history shows a steady increase in the quantity of 6s. I will challenge the bid because I find it unlikely that there are 8 sixes in total between both players' hands.
