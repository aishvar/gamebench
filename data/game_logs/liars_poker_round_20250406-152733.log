Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (93789590), I have a good distribution of digits. I see two 9s. A reasonable starting bid could be on 9s since I have a couple of them. Bidding '2 9s' seems like a safe and reasonable start because it reflects my hand's composition and doesn't overcommit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 06483325, I have no 9s, so the current bid of 2 9s relies entirely on Player 0 having at least two 9s, which is plausible but uncertain. However, since the bid is relatively low (only 2), it is risky to challenge now. Instead, I can increase the bid to a digit I hold more of. I have two 3s and two 8s, so bidding 3 3s increases the quantity beyond the current bid and is supported by my hand. This is a safer strategic move than challenging early.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have information about the exact count of 3s in the other player's hand, I'll consider my own hand and the bid history. I have 8 digits and one of them is 3. The total count of 3s could be more than 3 if the other player has at least 2 threes. However, I can bid on a higher digit. I see I have a 9 and an 8 and multiple other high digits. Bidding 3 9s seems reasonable because it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit, and I know I have at least one 9.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s. Since the total digits are 16, and I hold zero 9s, the opponent would need to have at least 3 9s alone for the bid of 3 9s to be valid. That is possible but somewhat unlikely, especially since they initially bid 2 9s and then raised to 3 9s possibly as a bluff or pressure tactic. Given the unlikelihood of them holding 3 or more 9s alone, challenging is a reasonable move.
