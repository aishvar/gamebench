Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains the digits 2, 6, 3, 1, 2, 0, 5, and 7. I see that I have two 2s, which is a good starting point. Given that there are no current bids, I should make a conservative but reasonable bid to start. I have two 2s, so bidding 2 2s seems like a good initial strategy.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 0, 6, 0, 6, 8, 3, 9. There are no 2s in my hand. The current bid is 2 2s, which means at least two 2s across all 24 digits. Since I have zero 2s, the remaining 16 digits (held by Players 0 and 2) would need to contain at least two 2s to make the bid valid, which is plausible. Therefore, challenging now is risky. The minimal raise is to bid 2 3s, but I have zero 3s as well. However, I do have two 8s and two 0s, so a safe and strategic higher bid would be '2 8s' or '2 9s' (I have one 9). Since '2 2s' is the current bid, I can outbid it by bidding '2 3s' or any higher digit at quantity 2, but it's safer to increase the quantity to 3 based on my hand. I have two 8s, so bidding '3 8s' is reasonable, assuming at least one more 8 among the other players.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are three 8s in total across all hands. Challenging seems like the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
