Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 5s. I will bid 2 5s to start.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. Given that my hand contains the digits 4, 6, 3, 8, 0, 2, 4, and 8, I have a total of 8 digits. I see that I have two 4s and two 8s, but no 5s or 6s or 7s or 9s or 1s or 5s. I do not have enough information about Player 0's hand but I can make an educated guess. Since I have no 5s, I should consider bidding on a digit that I have. The bid needs to be higher than 2 5s, so I should either increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 8s and two 4s but no 5s or higher quantity of any single digit. A safe bet would be to bid on a digit I have, increasing the quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I don't have any 4s in my hand. I could bid 3 5s, but I already bid 2 5s previously. I have two 5s, so I'll bid 4 5s to increase the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I need to assess the likelihood of this bid being valid and consider my own hand. My hand contains a 5, but not multiple 5s. I also have a few high digits that could potentially be used to make a strong bid. However, I must consider if challenging could be more beneficial or if I can make a valid higher bid. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are 8 digits per player, I have a total of 16 digits in play to consider. The current bid of 4 5s seems potentially valid but I need to increase either the quantity or the digit to make a higher bid. Since I have two 6s and a 7, and other digits that could potentially add up, I should consider if bidding higher on a digit I have is sensible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 6 6s is a safe increase and a valid bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 6S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 4, 6, 3, 8, 0, 2, 4, 8. I have two 6s and two 4s, but no 7s or higher quantity of any single digit than 2. The current bid of 6 6s seems high but I have two 6s, so I could potentially increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s, I can confidently bid higher on 6s or switch to a different digit. Bidding 7 6s seems reasonable as I have two 6s and it increases the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. It's possible there are at least seven 6s in total, but it's also possible my opponent is bluffing. I could bid higher, but I'm not confident enough. It's risky, but I will challenge to see if they are bluffing.
