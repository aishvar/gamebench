Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. My hand is 43696182, which contains two 6s and other digits distributed across 0-9. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand. I see that I have two 6s, so bidding on 6s with a quantity slightly higher than what I have seems like a good start. I'll bid 3 6s, increasing the quantity from my count and keeping the digit the same.
