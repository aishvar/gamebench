Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I need to start the bidding. Given my hand (04245778), I can see that there are multiple occurrences of the digit '4' and '7'. To maximize my chances of making a valid bid, I'll choose a digit that appears at least once in my hand. The digit '4' appears twice, and '7' appears twice as well. I'll bid on the digit '4' with a quantity of 2, but since I don't know what the other player has, I'll start with the lowest possible bid for a digit I have, which is '2'. However, considering the rules, the bid should be in the format 'BID: X Y' where X is the quantity and Y is the digit. Therefore, my initial bid will be for the digit '4' with a quantity of 2, but to follow the exact format, I need to specify it as 'BID: 2 4'.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 78809396, which contains 0 instances of the digit 4. The current bid is 2 4s, meaning there must be at least two 4s across both hands. Since I have zero 4s, all of these would have to be in Player 0's hand. Given typical digit distribution, it's somewhat unlikely Player 0 holds two or more 4s, but not impossible. However, since 2 is a conservative opening bid, it's plausible. A safe approach is to make a minimal higher bid to continue gathering information, rather than challenge immediately. I will increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving to 2 5s, which is a valid next bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '2 5s' and my hand '04245778', I have one 5 in my hand. Since the bid is '2 5s', I need to consider if there could be at least two 5s in total between both players' hands. Without knowing Player 1's hand, I must decide based on probability and the information I have. Since I only have one 5, to make a higher bid, I would need to bid on a higher digit or a higher quantity of the same digit. However, given that I do not have any information suggesting a higher digit is more abundant, and I can only see one 5 in my hand, challenging the bid seems like a reasonable option if I believe two 5s might be unlikely across both hands.
