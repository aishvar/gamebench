Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, so I need only one more 8 from the other player's eight unknown digits to reach three. Thus, bidding 3 8s is a reasonably safe opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. I have a few 8s in my hand, but I also need to consider the possibility of challenging if I think the bid is unlikely. My hand contains one 8. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 16 digits in total, bidding a higher quantity with a higher digit seems reasonable. I will bid 4 9s, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and while 4 9s could be possible given I only have one 9, I'd rather place a higher bid on a digit I hold multiples of. By bidding 5 8s, I increase the quantity above 4 and choose a digit I already have two of, making it a reasonable step up.

Player 0 bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains 3 eights. If I bid higher than 5, I must consider the total possible count of digits. Since the maximum quantity for any digit is 16, bidding a high quantity with a low digit or a moderate quantity with a high digit seems strategic. However, given that I have three 8s and it's unlikely there are more than 5 8s in total (considering the opponent could have up to 8 digits), I should either increase the quantity or the digit. A reasonable bid could be to increase the quantity or the digit slightly, considering my hand and possible hands of the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 8s, so my opponent would need four 8s to meet the bid of 6. That's highly unlikely, making a challenge the best move.
