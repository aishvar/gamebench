Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have two 9s, one 7, one 6, one 5, one 2 and one 1 in my hand. A safe starting bid would be to bid on a digit I have, increasing the quantity slightly. I will bid 1 9s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. Since the current bid is 1 9s, it's quite likely accurate. To make a safe higher bid, I can increase the digit with the same quantity or increase the quantity. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, which makes a bid of 2 3s quite reasonable. This increases the quantity and switches to a digit I have good evidence for.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have no 3s in my hand, making that bid potentially weak. I have two 9s, so bidding higher on 9s is a logical step. I can bid 3 9s, which is higher than 2 3s. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit, but increasing the quantity of a digit I hold seems strategically sound.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have exactly one 9. The current bid is 3 9s, meaning there must be at least two more 9s in my opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. Given each player has 8 digits, it is plausible but not highly likely that my opponent has two or more 9s. Since the probability is borderline and I prefer to pressure my opponent, I will raise to 3 9s -> 4 3s, as I have two 3s in my hand, making this bid safer and higher.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have no 3s in my hand, making it plausible but not certain. My hand contains two 9s. The previous bid was 3 9s, and I already bid 3 9s, so going higher on 9s is a viable strategy. Bidding 4 9s is a reasonable increase, as it's the same quantity as the current bid but for a different digit, and I have the cards to support it. Alternatively, I could bid a lower quantity on a different digit, but increasing the quantity of 9s seems strategically sound given my hand.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 65143789, I have exactly one 9. The current bid is 4 9s, meaning there must be at least four 9s in total. Since I only have one, the opponent would need to have at least three 9s, which is unlikely given the distribution of digits. The probability that they hold three or more 9s out of eight digits is quite low, making the current bid suspicious. Therefore, challenging is the best strategic move.
