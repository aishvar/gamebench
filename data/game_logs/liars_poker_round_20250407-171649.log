Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 02464836. I have eight digits. There are two players, so there are 16 digits in total. The expected frequency of any digit is 1.6 (16/10). I have two 4s and two 6s, which is slightly above the expected average. As it's the first bid, I should make a bid based on my hand. Bidding on a digit I hold multiple times is a good strategy. I hold two 4s. Bidding '3 4s' is a reasonable opening bid. It asserts some strength based on my hand (having two 4s) and requires the opponent to have only one 4 for the bid to be true, which is statistically plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. In my hand, there are no 4s. Since the maximum possible 4s across both hands is 4 (if the other player has 4 4s), the bid of 3 4s is plausible but not certain. However, bidding higher on 4s is not possible for me as I have none. I will challenge the bid as I believe it's unlikely the other player has 3 4s.
