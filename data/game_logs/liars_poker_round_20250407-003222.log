Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to start the bidding. In my hand, I have two 9s, one 5, one 3, one 1, one 0, and two 2s. Based on this, I can confidently start with a reasonable bid of 3 9s, as I already have two 9s and it's likely the other player has at least one more.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, so the current bid of 3 9s is unlikely to be true. Since I can't make a higher bid with 9s (as I have none), I should challenge the bid to potentially win the round.
