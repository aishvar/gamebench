Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (93667765), I have: two 6s, two 7s, one 9, one 5, one 3. Since this is the opening bid and I want to bid based on what I know for certain, I'll bid based on my strongest digit - either 6s or 7s, which I have two of each. I'll choose 6s since it's the lower number and leaves room for increasing later. A conservative opening bid of 3 6s is reasonable since I already have two 6s in my hand, and there's a decent chance of finding at least one more 6 in the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 5, 0, 2, 4, 0, 3, 3, 1, which contains no 6s. Since the current bid is 3 6s, for that bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least 3 6s in their hand. Given that each player only has 8 digits, it's statistically unlikely for the opponent to have 3 or more of a single digit, especially since I have none. Therefore, I believe the bid is unlikely to be true, and the best move is to challenge.
