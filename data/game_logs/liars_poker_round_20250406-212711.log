Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 1 0s, which is a low bid. Bidding 2 9s is a valid higher bid as it increases both quantity and digit. I'm confident in this bid because I have two 9s, and even if Player 0 has none, the total is still two.
