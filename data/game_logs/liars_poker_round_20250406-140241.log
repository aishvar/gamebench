Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid in the game. Looking at my hand (20601948), I have: one 0, one 1, one 2, one 4, one 5 (actually, I don't have a 5 - I have a 6), one 6, one 8, and one 9. Since I'm making the first bid, I should choose a digit I have in my hand to increase my chances. I could bid conservatively (like '1 0s' since I have one 0), but that would be too easy to outbid. A more strategic opening bid would be to claim a moderate quantity of a digit I possess. I have a 9 in my hand, and 9 is the highest digit, making it harder for others to outbid me without increasing the quantity. I'll bid 3 9s, estimating there might be 2 more 9s among the other players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand is 55563916, which contains no 9s. Given that there are 3 players and each has 8 digits, the total number of digits is 24. The bid of 3 9s implies that there are at least three 9s across all hands. Since I have no 9s, the other two players must have at least three 9s between them. This is possible but seems unlikely as it would mean they have a significant portion of the total 9s. I have a 6, which is higher than the digit 5 but lower than 9. I can bid higher than 3 9s by bidding a higher quantity. Bidding 4 0s or any other low digit might be too conservative, but it's a safer option. I can also consider challenging, but given that it's the first bid and there's still a lot of uncertainty, I might try to bid higher. Bidding 4 9s seems too aggressive as it implies a very high number of 9s. A more reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity but with a lower digit or the same digit if I had it. Since I don't have a 9, I'll consider a different digit. I can bid 3 0s or higher, but my hand doesn't support a high confidence in any digit being abundant enough to make a significantly higher bid than 3 9s. However, bidding 4 5s is plausible because I have three 5s, and it's a relatively safe increase in quantity. It's also a more reasonable bid than challenging the current bid directly.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 4 fives in total. Given that I have one 5 in my hand and there are 8 secret digits per player, there are 24 digits in total. I should consider the possibility of other players having multiple 5s. However, without knowing the exact distribution, I must make an educated guess. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should look for a digit and quantity that seems plausible but also challenging for the next player. I have one 5 and other digits that could potentially add up if others have multiple 5s or higher digits. A safe bet would be to increase the quantity or digit slightly, considering the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and the current bid is 4 5s.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '5 6s'. Looking at my hand (20601948), I have only one 6. For there to be at least 5 sixes total, the other two players would need to have at least 4 more sixes between them. With 8 digits per player and 3 players, there are 24 total digits in play. The probability of having at least 5 sixes out of the remaining 16 unknown digits (24 total - 8 in my hand) is reasonable. However, I don't have many sixes myself, which makes me somewhat suspicious. Still, 5 out of 24 possible digits being sixes (about 21%) is not unreasonable. I could bid higher, but I think challenging is the better move given my hand composition. I only have one 6, and the bid is already at 5 sixes, which means the other players would need to have 4 between them.
