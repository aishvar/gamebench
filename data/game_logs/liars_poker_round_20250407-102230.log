Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the opening bid, and my hand contains one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 7, and one 1 again (so two 1s). Since there are 16 digits in total and no bids yet, a safe and informative opening bid would be 2 1s, reflecting the two 1s I hold, which is a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 41230761, I have one '2'. The current bid is 2 2s, which means there must be at least two 2s in total. Since I have only one, it's plausible Player 1 has at least one 2, making the bid reasonable. Challenging now would be risky. To make a strictly higher bid, I can either increase the digit at the same quantity or increase the quantity. I see two '1's in my hand, so a safe next bid is 2 3s (higher digit) or 3 1s (higher quantity). I have two '1's, so a bid of 3 1s is plausible, expecting Player 1 to have at least one '1'. Therefore, I will bid 3 1s.
