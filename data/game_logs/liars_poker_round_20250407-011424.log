Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s, two 2s, two 9s, and one 8 in my hand. Since there are no previous bids, I need to make a valid bid. A reasonable starting bid could be 2 1s, as I have 2 of them and it sets a foundation for the game.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have zero 1s in my hand (43725308). For the current bid to be true, the opponent must have at least two 1s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, challenging such a low bid early is risky. I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding '2 3s' would be a safe, truthful bid higher than '2 1s'. However, bidding '3 3s' is also a reasonable option. It requires only one 3 from the opponent's 8 digits, which is statistically likely (approx. 57% chance they have at least one 3). This bid increases the quantity, putting more pressure on the opponent. Given my two 3s, '3 3s' is a strong and justifiable next bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, which gives me a strong position to increase the bid. The current bid is 3 3s, and I can bid 4 9s, which is a valid higher bid both in quantity and digit.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. My hand (43725308) contains zero 9s. For the bid to be true, the other player (Player 0) must have at least four 9s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having four or more of a specific digit out of eight is very low (approximately 0.5% assuming random distribution). Given I hold none of the bid digit, the likelihood of the current bid being accurate is extremely small. Therefore, challenging is the most statistically sound move.
