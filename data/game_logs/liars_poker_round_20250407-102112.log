Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s relies entirely on Player 0 having at least one 0, which is quite plausible. Since the opening bid is very low and easy to exceed, it's strategically better to make a minimal higher bid rather than challenge. I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, such as bidding 1 2s, since I have one 2 in my hand, making this bid safe based on my knowledge.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 23969894. I have one 3, which aligns with the current bid of 1 3s. Since the bid is low and easily plausible, challenging would be unwise. A natural progression is to increase the quantity or digit. I have two 9s, so bidding 2 9s is a reasonable and safe higher bid, leveraging my strong count of 9s.
