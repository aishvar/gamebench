Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 0s, one 6, one 9, and two 1s. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 3s, as I hold two 3s myself, making it likely the total count is at least 2.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 3, 6, 3, 0, 3, 9, 0, 1. I have three 3s and two 0s, but no 4s. The current bid is 2 4s, which means at least two 4s across both hands. Since I have zero 4s, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least two 4s. This is possible but not guaranteed. Given that two 4s in one hand is plausible, challenging now is risky. Instead, I can make a safe and stronger bid based on my own hand. Since I have three 3s, I can confidently bid 3 3s, which is both a higher quantity and a lower digit, but rules require same quantity with higher digit or higher quantity regardless of digit. So, bidding 3 3s is a valid higher bid.
