Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand, which provides a solid foundation for a bid. Starting with 3 4s is a reasonable opening that is likely to be true and sets a good starting point for future bids.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. My hand (06270152) contains zero 4s. For the current bid to be true, the opponent must hold at least three 4s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, requiring the opponent to have three or more of a specific digit when I have none makes the bid suspect, especially as the first bid. Therefore, challenging seems like a strong strategic move.
