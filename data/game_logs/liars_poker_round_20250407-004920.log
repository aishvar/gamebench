Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (05338141), I have two 3s and two 1s, which are the most frequent digits. Bidding 2 3s seems reasonable as it's a safe starting point, and I can increase the bid later if needed.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have one 3 in my hand, so the opponent must have at least one 3 for the bid to be valid. Challenging has a ~50% chance of success, but bidding a higher digit (9) with the same quantity (2) is safer. Since I have one 9, there's a ~57% chance the opponent has at least one 9, making the bid valid. This reduces risk compared to challenging.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 9S'
Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 9s. Since I can't increase the quantity of 9s based on my hand, I'll increase the digit to the next highest possible. Bidding 2 0s would be invalid as it doesn't increase the bid. Instead, I'll bid 3 0s, which is a valid higher bid based on the rules, even though I don't have 0s in my hand. This forces the opponent to either bid higher or challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 3 in my hand. Since Player 0 previously bid 2 3s, if they have at least two 3s, the total would be at least three. Bidding 3 3s is a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit than 0) and aligns with plausible counts based on prior bids.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 3S'
Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 3s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have three 3s, I can confidently bid 4 3s, increasing the quantity while keeping the same digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. My hand has 1 '3'. To challenge, I assume the opponent has 2 or fewer '3's (total â‰¤ 3). Given their bid history (starting with 2 3s and raising to 4), they might have 2-3 '3's. While risky, the probability of their having only 2 '3's (total 3) is higher than having 3 (total 4). Challenging offers a strategic gamble here.
