Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I looked at my hand (05505490) and noticed I have three 5s. Since there are no bids yet, it’s smart to open with a bid that I can comfortably cover with my own numbers. Bidding '3 5s' is safe because I know I hold three 5s, and with 8 unknown digits on my opponent’s side, it’s likely the total count won’t fall below three.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 9, 4, 1, 6, 3, 6, 1, 1. I have zero 5s, so the entire bid relies on Player 0's hand. The current bid is 3 5s, which assumes that Player 0 holds at least 3 or possibly more 5s. Given that I have none, the probability that Player 0 has 3 or more 5s out of 8 digits is quite low. Therefore, challenging this bid is a strategically sound move.
