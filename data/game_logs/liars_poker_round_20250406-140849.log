Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains the digits: 4, 6, 1, 8, 4, 7, 9, 3. I see that I have two 4s and two 8s. A reasonable starting bid could be 2 8s because I have two 8s and it's a good starting point to increase the quantity or digit later.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand (43952128), so I know there's at least 1 eight among all players. The current bid is 2 8s, which is quite low and reasonable. Given that there are 24 total digits in play (8 per player Ã— 3 players), it's very likely there are at least 2 eights total. I could challenge, but it's risky since the bid is modest. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 2s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 2s. I'll bid 3 2s, increasing the quantity while changing the digit.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have one 8 and two 6s and other digits in my hand, but no 2s. The bid of 3 2s implies there are at least three 2s across all hands. I need to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. Since I don't have any 2s, it's possible the other players have them. Bidding higher on a different digit or the same quantity with a higher digit is an option. I can bid 3 3s or higher. Let's analyze: if I bid 3 3s, it might be too low if the other players have 3s. I can see I have a good number of higher digits, so bidding 3 6s or higher seems more reasonable. However, I should start with a conservative increase. Bidding 3 3s is a minimal increase and tests the waters.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains a 6, 9, 3, and other digits. I can see if I bid 4 3s or higher, it would be a reasonable challenge given the current state. However, I should consider if my digits can support a higher bid. Since I have a 3 in my hand, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. The current bid is 3 3s, so I should consider bidding higher than 3 or bidding the same quantity with a higher digit.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of '4 3s'. Looking at my hand (43952128), I have one 3 in it. The question is whether there are likely to be at least 3 more 3s among the other players' hands. Given that Player 2 previously bid '3 3s', they likely have at least one 3 in their hand. Player 0 increased the bid to '4 3s', suggesting they might have at least one 3 as well. If each player has at least one 3, then the total would be at least 3, making '4 3s' a risky but possible bid. I could challenge, but there's a reasonable chance the bid is valid. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 2s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 2s. I'll bid '5 2s', increasing the quantity.

Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 5 2s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. My hand is 76835868, which contains one 2 and one 8. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have many 2s, it's possible that the total count of 2s is around 5. However, I can try to bid on a higher digit. Bidding 5 3s is a reasonable move as it keeps the same quantity but increases the digit. I'll make this bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains a 6, 4, 7, 9, 3, 1, 8, and 5. I see one 3 in my hand, so there are at least 2 threes in the game (including the bidder's). Given that the last bid was 5 3s, I should try to bid higher than 5. I can see if I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 6 and a 9, and several other digits, I might be able to get away with a higher digit or quantity. However, I only have one 3, so I should be cautious about bidding too high on 3s. I will increase the quantity to 6 and keep the digit as 3, or go for a higher digit. I have no 2s or 4s or 0s, so bidding 6 or more of a low digit is risky. I will bid 6 4s as I have a 4 and a 6 and can reasonably assume other players might have some lower digits.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 6 4s across all players. There are 24 total digits in the game (8 per player). If I have 1 four, that means the other players would need to have 5 more fours between them to make the current bid valid. While possible, that seems somewhat high given a random distribution. Looking at the bid history, Player 0 has been aggressive, starting with 2 8s, then raising to 4 3s, and now 6 4s. They've been escalating quantities significantly. I also notice I have two 2s in my hand, which matches my earlier bid of 5 2s (suggesting I believed there were at least 3 more 2s). I could bid 6 5s or 7 4s, but given that I only have one 4 and no 5s, I think the current bid of 6 4s is getting risky. I'll challenge it.
