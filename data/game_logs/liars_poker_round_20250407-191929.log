--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand (26760385), the digit '6' appears once, '0' once, '2' once, '7' once, '3' once, '8' twice, and '5' once. A safe opening bid is typically 2 of a digit I hold at least once, as it's likely the opponent has at least one more of that digit. '8' appears twice in my hand, so bidding 2 eights is conservative and reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (59441206), I see I have one '8'. The current bid is '2 8s'. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one '8', bidding higher on '8' is risky without knowing Player 0's full hand. However, I can try to bid on a higher digit. I notice I have multiple '9's (none in this case), but I do have several digits that could potentially be bid on if they are higher than 8, or I could try to challenge if I think 2 '8's is unlikely. Given my hand, I see no '9's but several lower digits. I will challenge the bid because I believe it's unlikely Player 0 has 2 '8's, and I don't have enough '8's to confidently increase the quantity.
