Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first turn, and there are no previous bids. I have two 5s, one 6, one 3, one 7, one 9, one 8, and one 4 in my hand. A reasonable opening bid would be 2 5s since I already have two 5s, and it's a safe and logical starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 6, 5, 2, 8, 9, 4, 2, 6. I have one 5. The current bid is 2 5s, so it's plausible that the opponent has at least one 5, making the bid reasonable. To outbid, I can raise the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s, a safe and natural raise is to bid 3 6s, relying on my strong holding and the likelihood that the opponent might have at least one 6 as well.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 6s. Considering there are 16 digits in total, it is likely that at least one more 6 exists in the opponent's hand, making the bid plausible. To stay in the game and raise the stakes, I will bid 4 6s, increasing the quantity while keeping the same digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 65289426, I have three 6s. The current bid is 4 6s, which would require at least one more 6 in the opponent's hand. Since 4 6s is quite plausible, challenging now would be risky. To maintain pressure and avoid a premature challenge, I will make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit to 4 7s, which is slightly safer than increasing the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. In my hand, I have one 7. If Player 1 also has several 7s, the bid might be plausible, but there is no strong evidence to suggest there are at least four 7s across both hands. Instead of risking a higher bid, I will challenge Player 1's bid as it seems unlikely to be valid.
