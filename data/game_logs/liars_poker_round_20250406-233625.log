Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 2 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand has two 6s. The current bid is 2 4s. Bidding 2 6s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Since I already have two 6s, the total count must be at least two, making this a safe bid that forces the opponent to respond.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I don't have any 6s in my hand. To make a valid bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. I can bid 3 0s, as I have one 0 in my hand. This is a safe increase.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 0s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s. Since there are only 8 unknown digits (opponent's hand), the maximum possible 0s in play is 8. However, given the opponent's previous bids (2 4s, then 3 0s) and my lack of 0s, it's possible they're bluffing or overbidding. The risk/reward favors challenging as they would need exactly 3/8 of their hand to be 0s to justify the bid, which seems statistically unlikely.
