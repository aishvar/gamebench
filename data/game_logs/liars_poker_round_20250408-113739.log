Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a mix of digits, but the current bid is None. Since I know my own hand, I can start with a reasonable bid. I have two 1s, one 3, and one 8. Bidding 2 1s seems like a good starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 67083694, I don't have any 1s. The current bid is 2 1s, which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least two 1s total. Since I have zero 1s in my hand, Player 0 would need to have at least two 1s in their hand for this bid to be valid. While this is possible, I can make a safe higher bid based on what I can see in my hand. I have one 6, which allows me to confidently bid '2 6s', increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity. This is a conservative bid that builds on my known cards.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, which is a good start. Given the bid history, I should aim to increase both the quantity and the digit. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable, considering I have a 7 in my hand and the current bid is relatively low.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand (67083694). The opponent bid '3 7s', claiming there are at least 3 sevens total. Since I only have 1 seven, they must have at least 2 sevens in their hand for this bid to be valid. While possible, this seems somewhat unlikely. However, rather than challenge, I'll make a conservative higher bid of '3 8s'. This is safer because: 1) I have no 8s but the total bid quantity remains low at 3, 2) Moving to a higher digit is less risky than increasing quantity, and 3) If challenged, the opponent would need to prove their '3 7s' bid first.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have a 9 in my hand, which is higher than the digit 8. I should bid on the digit 9, with a quantity of 1, as it's the highest digit I have.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Since I have a single 8, bidding 4 8s is a reasonable increase in quantity based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The opponent bid 4 8s, meaning they're claiming there are at least 3 more 8s in their hand. While possible, this seems unlikely given they started with lower bids and suddenly jumped to 4 8s. Also, they raised my previous bid of 3 8s to 4 8s, suggesting they might be bluffing to force me into a higher bid. Given this bidding pattern and that I only have one 8, I think they're likely bluffing.
