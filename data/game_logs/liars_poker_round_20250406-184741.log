--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 2s, two 1s, one 3, one 5, and one 8. The most common digits in my hand are 0, 1, and 2 with two occurrences each. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 of one of these digits. I'll choose 2s for the opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 2s. Bidding 2 6s is a valid higher bid since 6 is greater than 2, and I have enough 6s to support this bid.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 05023812, I have no 6s. Since the current bid is only 2 6s, it's quite plausible that the opponent has two or more 6s, so challenging now is risky. To make a safe higher bid, I can consider digits I hold. I have two 2s, so bidding 3 2s is a minimal and safe raise, increasing the quantity by one and focusing on a digit I possess.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 2S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 2s. Considering the opponent might be bluffing and given that I only have one 2, I suspect the total number of 2s may be less than 3. Challenging the bid is a strategic move to test this assumption.
