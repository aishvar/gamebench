Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 02647925, I notice I have two 2s, two 5s, and one each of 0, 6, 4, 7, and 9. Starting with a conservative opening bid based on my two 2s seems reasonable. Therefore, I will bid 2 2s to initiate the game.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 0, 2, 6, 4, 7, 9, 2, 5. I have two 2s but zero 3s. The current bid is 2 3s, which is plausible, but since I have no 3s, I don't have direct evidence to support a higher count of 3s. A minimal safe overbid would be 2 4s, but I only have one 4. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity and switch to a digit I hold multiple of. I have two 2s, so bidding 3 2s is a reasonable escalation, as it's likely there is at least one 2 in the opponent's hand, making 3 total. Therefore, I choose to bid 3 2s, increasing the quantity and switching to a digit I have strong knowledge of.
