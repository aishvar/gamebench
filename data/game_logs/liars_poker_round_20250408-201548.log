Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open with an initial bid. My hand contains two 5s, two 8s, and one each of 0, 1, 3, and 7. A reasonable conservative opening bid is 2 5s or 2 8s, as I hold two of each, making it plausible across both hands. I will choose 2 8s to start with a digit that is relatively high.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s and zero 9s. The current bid is 2 9s, which is plausible but uncertain. Since I hold no 9s, I can't confidently raise on 9s, but I can make a higher bid by increasing quantity or digit. I know there are at least two 8s (mine), so a bid of 3 8s is reasonable, expecting at least one 8 in the opponent's hand. This is a safe and higher bid than 2 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 37158058, I have two 8s and zero 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, which would require my opponent to hold at least 3 or more 9s since I have none. Given that the total number of digits is 16 and I see zero 9s, it's unlikely my opponent has all 3 or more 9s. Therefore, challenging is the most strategic move here.
