Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. Since I'm the first to bid, I can start with a reasonable quantity. Bidding 3 6s is a safe starting point because I know I have three 6s, and it's a higher digit which might be harder for the opponent to challenge.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are three 6s in total, but it's also possible. I could challenge, but I should try to bid first. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable move, increasing both the quantity and the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. Since I have no 8s in my hand, it's unlikely that there are four 8s in total. Challenging this bid is a strategic move given the low probability of such a high count.
