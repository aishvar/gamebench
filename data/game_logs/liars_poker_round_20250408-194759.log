Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a balanced hand containing one each of 2, 1, 5, 0, 4, 3, 7, and 8. Since there is no current bid, I need to start conservatively. Bidding '1 5s' is a safe opening move because I hold a 5, ensuring that at least one 5 is in play, and it sets a low base for future bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 5s. I have one 5 in my hand (94516861), which means the bid is true, so I cannot challenge. I must make a higher bid. I have two 1s and two 6s in my hand. Bidding based on pairs is a common strategy. Bidding '2 1s' is a valid higher bid (increasing quantity from 1 to 2). Since I hold two 1s, it's plausible that there are at least two 1s across both hands (16 total digits). This bid uses information from my hand and is statistically reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 21504378, which gives me one 2, among other digits. The current bid is 2 1s, and I can raise the bid by keeping the quantity at 2 but increasing the digit (since 2 is higher than 1). Bidding 2 2s leverages my hand (holding a 2) and maintains a reasonable risk level given that the opponent would need to supply at least one more 2 to meet the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand is 94516861. I have zero 2s, so challenging would require the opponent to have fewer than two 2s (0 or 1). This is risky as '2 2s' is a low bid and plausible. I should look for a higher bid. My hand contains two 1s and two 6s. A bid must be higher than '2 2s', meaning either quantity 3+ or quantity 2 with a digit higher than 2. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding '2 6s' is truthful based solely on my hand, requires zero 6s from the opponent, and is higher than '2 2s' (same quantity, higher digit). This seems like a safe and reasonable progression.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 6s' and I have no 6 in my hand. Since the opponent only has 8 digits, the chance they hold at least two 6s is quite low (around 18-19% if digits are uniformly random). This makes the current bid seem unsustainable, so I will challenge.
