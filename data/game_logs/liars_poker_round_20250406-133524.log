Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand (65992717), I have: one 1, one 2, one 5, one 6, one 7, and two 9s. Since I have two 9s in my hand, that's a good starting point. The other player likely has some 9s as well, so bidding 3 9s is reasonable - it only requires the other player to have at least one 9 in their hand, which has a decent probability. Starting with a high digit like 9 also gives me room to increase the digit later if needed.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s, which makes the likelihood of there being at least three 9s across both hands less probable. Since there are only 16 digits total, and I hold zero 9s, the opponent would need all three or more 9s in their hand, which is unlikely. Therefore, it's a good spot to challenge the bid.
