Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to start the bidding. In my hand, I have one 1, one 2, one 6, one 7, one 8, one 5, and two 9s. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be 2 9s, as I already have two 9s in my hand, making it highly likely that there are at least two 9s in total across both players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s, so the current bid of 2 9s assumes both are on the opponent's side, which is plausible but not guaranteed. Since the bid is relatively low, it's risky to challenge now. I do have two 0s and two 7s, so I can safely increase the bid by quantity and digit. Bidding 3 7s leverages my strong count of 7s, making it a reasonable next move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 7s. This means there need to be at least two more 7s in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. While possible, it feels risky to challenge this early given the low bid. Instead, I can make a higher bid. I also have two 1s in my hand, which makes bidding 4 1s a reasonable and safe move, as it increases the quantity and shifts to a digit I have stronger evidence for.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 76750803, I have zero 1s. The current bid is 4 1s, which means there must be at least four 1s across both hands. Since I have none, the opponent would need all four 1s in their hand, which is unlikely given only eight digits. The probability of them holding four or more 1s is low, so challenging is the best move.
