Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I start with a bid on the highest digit I hold. Bidding 2 9s is safe because I know I have two, and the opponent might have none or one. This sets a baseline that requires future bids to increase the quantity or digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '9' in my hand, meaning only one additional '9' is required from my opponent's 8 digits for the current bid of '2 9s' to be valid. Given the high probability that my opponent has at least one '9', challenging now would be risky. Instead, I prefer to make a slightly higher bid to maintain control. My hand contains two '6's, making a bid of '3 6s' reasonable and safe, as it increases both quantity and digit while aligning with my known information.

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. My hand has no 6s, so the opponent must have at least three to validate the bid. With only 8 digits in their hand, having three 6s is possible but statistically less likely. Challenging minimizes risk given my lack of 6s and the bid's dependency on their hand.
