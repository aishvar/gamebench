Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (27990608), I have: two 9s, two 0s, and one each of 2,7,6,8. Since this is the first bid, I want to start conservatively but with a digit I know exists in decent quantity. I have two 0s in my hand, and since zeros are common digits, it's a reasonable opening bid. I'll bid three 0s, which means I only need to find one more zero in the opponent's hand to be correct.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 zeros. Looking at my hand (90312412), I have one zero. For the bid to be valid, the total zeros between both hands must be at least 3. Since I only have 1 zero, the opponent would need at least 2 zeros for the bid to be accurate. This is plausible, but somewhat risky to assume. However, since 3 zeros is a relatively conservative bid early in the game, it is safer to continue bidding rather than challenge now. The next highest legal bid can be 3 1s, as increasing the digit with the same quantity is valid. In my hand, I have two 1s, so bidding 3 1s is a safe and strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 27990608, I have 0 ones. The current bid claims there are 3 ones total between both hands. Since I have none, that means my opponent would need to have all 3 ones in their hand for this bid to be true. While possible, having 3 of the same digit is somewhat unlikely. Additionally, if they had such a strong holding of ones, they might have bid higher. Based on the previous bidding where I bid 3 zeros (knowing I had 3), their choice to bid the same quantity but higher digit seems more like a safe incremental raise rather than a confident bid based on actual holdings.
