Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand 98407453, the digit '4' appears twice, which is the highest count of any digit in my hand. Opening with a bid on a digit I have multiple of is a solid strategy because it increases the likelihood that the total count across both hands is at least that number. Therefore, I will open with a bid of 2 fours.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 4s'. To assess its validity, we need to consider the count of '4' in our hand and the maximum possible count across both hands. My hand is '92867611', which contains one '6' and no '4's. The total count of '4' in my hand is 0. Since the bid is on '4s' and I have 0 '4s', the bid of '2 4s' suggests that Player 0 has at least 2 '4s' or is bluffing. The maximum possible count of '4s' across both hands is 8 (if both players had all '4s'). A bid of '2 4s' is relatively conservative. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. The next higher digit is '5', but there's no '5' in my hand either. However, I can consider bidding on a higher quantity of '4s' or the same quantity of a higher digit if it exists in my hand or if I believe it's likely in the other player's hand. Since my hand has a '6' and '8' (from '92867611'), and '8' is higher than '4' and '6' is also higher, I can consider bidding on '6s' as there's at least one '6' in my hand. The quantity is '2', and I can bid '2 6s' as it exceeds the current bid by being a higher digit. Thus, making a bid of '2 6s' is a valid move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 sixes. Looking at my hand (98407453), I have zero 6s. Since I hold half of the digits and see no 6s, the entire 16-digit pool would need to have both sixes in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely given the distribution. Additionally, I can raise the bid if I have a strong case with other digits. In my hand, I have two 4s and two 0s, which suggests that higher bids on 4s or 0s might be safer options. Since the original bid was 2 4s, I can safely increase to 3 4s, leveraging my two 4s and hoping Player 1 has at least one. This is a reasonable and strategic escalation.

Player 0 bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I need to assess my hand and the bidding history to decide my next move. My hand is 92867611, which contains one '6' and no '4's. The bid history started with 2 4s by Player 0, then I bid 2 6s, and Player 0 responded with 3 4s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have any '4's, I should consider the likelihood of '4's in Player 0's hand and the total count. Given that Player 0 initially bid 2 4s and then increased it to 3 4s after my bid on '6's, it suggests they might have a reasonable count of '4's. However, I have to make a decision based on my hand and the information available. I can either challenge the bid if I think it's unlikely or make a higher bid. Since I don't have any '4's, and there are 8 cards in each hand, it's plausible that both hands together have at least 3 '4's, especially if Player 0 has some. My hand has one '6', so the total count of '6's could be at least 2 (one in my hand and potentially one in Player 0's hand), but bidding 2 7s or higher would be a safer bet as it exceeds the current bid and I can reasonably assume the presence of some '7's or higher digits in both hands. I will bid on a higher digit to exceed the current bid.

Player 1 bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 9, 8, 4, 0, 7, 4, 5, 3. Counting 7s, I have only one 7. The current bid claims there are at least three 7s across both hands. Since I only have one, Player 1 must have at least two 7s for the bid to be valid. This is somewhat unlikely, as two or more 7s in eight digits is not common. Given the prior bids were on 4s and 6s, and now Player 1 has shifted to 7s, possibly bluffing, I believe challenging is the best move rather than raising to an unlikely 4 7s or switching digits.
