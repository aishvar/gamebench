Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with a safe bid of 2 1s ensures validity (as even if the opponent has none, the total count would be exactly 2). This also sets a moderate baseline for future bids.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s, and I do not have any 1s in my hand. However, it is very likely that there are at least two 1s across both hands, as there are 16 digits in total. To maintain a valid bid, I will increase the quantity slightly and bid on a digit I have in my hand. Since I have three 6s, bidding 3 6s is a reasonable move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The opponent bid 3 6s, requiring at least two 6s in their hand. Statistically, there's an ~81% chance they have fewer than two 6s (total â‰¤2), making the bid invalid. Challenging now has a high probability of success.
