Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 77106334. There are 16 total digits in play (2 players * 8 digits). The expected average count for any digit is 1.6. I have two 3s and two 7s, which is slightly more than the average. As this is the first bid, I should make a plausible opening bid based on my hand. Bidding '2 Threes' or '2 Sevens' would be very safe as I hold two of each. However, a slightly more standard opening bid is to claim one more than I hold of my most frequent digits. Bidding '3 Threes' requires my opponent to have at least one 3 among their 8 digits, which is reasonably probable (roughly 57% chance assuming random distribution). This bid leverages my hand's strength in 3s and starts the bidding at a level that requires a response.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains no 3s (digits are 2, 9, 9, 9, 5, 5, 8, 2). The current bid is 3 3s, meaning there must be at least three 3s across both hands. Since I have zero, all three would have to be in Player 0's hand, which is unlikely though possible. Given the distribution, it's more probable that Player 0 is bluffing or overestimating. Therefore, challenging is strategically sound.
