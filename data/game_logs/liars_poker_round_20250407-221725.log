Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s and two 0s, which are strong starting points. Opening with a conservative and plausible bid based on my hand, I'll bid 2 8s to reflect the two 8s I hold, which is a safe opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. The current bid is 2 8s, which is plausible since the opponent could have one or more 8s. Since I have one 8 myself, it's quite reasonable to expect at least two 8s in total, so challenging now would likely be risky. To increase the bid, I can either bid 3 0s (since I have one 0) or 3 1s (since I have one 1), but these may be riskier without more supporting digits. Alternatively, I can simply increase the quantity on 8s to 3 8s, which is a natural progression and puts pressure back on the opponent. Given that I have one 8, it's plausible there could be two more in the opponent's hand, so bidding 3 8s is a reasonable strategic move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s. Given the current bid of 3 8s, it is quite plausible that the opponent has at least one 8, making the bid reasonable. Challenging now would be risky. To continue, I can make a higher bid. I don't have many 9s (none), but I do have two 0s, so increasing the quantity to 4 and choosing a digit I have some of is safer. Therefore, bidding 4 0s is a reasonable next move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '19051847', I have only one 0. The current bid is 4 zeros across both hands. Since I only have one, my opponent would need at least 3 zeros, which is unlikely given the distribution (average zeros per hand is about 1.6). Four zeros total is a risky bet, so challenging is the best move.
