--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand 94529303, I have two 9s, two 3s, two 0s, one 4, and one 5. A safe and strategic opening bid is usually 2 of a digit I have multiple of. I will start with 2 9s, leveraging my pair of 9s, which is a reasonable and truthful opening bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. I could bid 3 of any digit. I will bid 3 0s.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s and two 0s. The current bid is 3 0s, so for that to be valid, there must be at least one more 0 in the opponent's hand. Since that's quite plausible, challenging now is risky. To raise, I can bid 3 1s (higher digit, same quantity), or 4 of any digit. I have two 9s, so a bid of 3 9s is invalid as it's lower than my previous 2 9s bid. Given my two 9s, it's reasonable to suspect there might be at least two more 9s across both hands, making 4 9s plausible. Therefore, I'll increase the quantity and bid 4 9s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. The maximum possible number of 9s is 16. 4 is a relatively low number, so it's plausible. I could bid 5 of any digit, or 4 of a higher digit. I have two 1s, two 2s, and two 6s. Bidding 5 0s seems like a safe increase. I don't want to bid based on my hand, as that could lead to a challenge I lose.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s. The opponent's bid is 5 0s, implying they believe there are at least five zeros across both hands. Since I only have two, that would require the opponent to hold at least three zeros, which is statistically unlikely given there are only 8 digits per hand. The probability of one player having three or more zeros is low, making the bid of 5 zeros quite risky. Therefore, I will challenge this bid.
