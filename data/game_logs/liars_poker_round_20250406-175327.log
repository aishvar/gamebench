--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have three 6s. It is statistically reasonable to open with a conservative but credible bid based on my hand alone. Therefore, I will bid 3 6s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 6s (digits: 6,1,6,1,8,6,5,3). The current bid is 3 7s. Since I don't know Player 1's hand, the probability of there being at least 3 7s total is uncertain, but I do know that there are already 3 6s in my hand alone. It is safer to increase the bid to 4 6s, leveraging my strong count of 6s, rather than challenge or bid on a digit I have less information about.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (61618653), I have one 7. The current bid is 4 7s, meaning there must be at least four 7s across both hands. Since I only have one, the opponent would need to have at least three 7s for the bid to be valid. Given that each player has only eight digits, it's statistically unlikely they hold three or more 7s, as that would mean nearly half of their hand is 7s. Therefore, the bid is probably an overreach, making a challenge the optimal move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 1's (Naive 50/50) bid of 4 7s.
