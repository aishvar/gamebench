Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I should start conservatively. My hand (81246930) has one digit repeated (digit 8), and several unique digits. Digit '8' appears once, so bidding a low quantity of a digit I already have seems safer. I'll start with a modest bid of '2 8s', assuming the opponent might also have at least one '8'.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are more than 2 8s in total, so challenging seems like a good move.
