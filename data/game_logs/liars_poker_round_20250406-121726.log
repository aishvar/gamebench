Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid (Current Bid: None). My hand is 36311984. I have two 1s and two 3s. The statistically expected number of any digit across all 32 digits (4 players * 8 digits) is 3.2. Having two 3s in my hand makes bidding three 3s a reasonable opening. It's slightly above the count in my hand but aligns with the statistical average, making it a safe starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '3' in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s. With 3 other players, it's possible that the total count of 3s is at least 3, but not guaranteed. However, since I have one, I can make a conservative higher bid by increasing the digit to 4, which I also have one of in my hand. This maintains the quantity but increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid.
