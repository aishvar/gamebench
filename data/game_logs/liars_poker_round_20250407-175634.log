Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to establish an opening bid. My hand is 38681559, which contains two 8s and two 5s. With 16 total digits in play (2 players * 8 digits), the expected number of any specific digit is 1.6 (16 * 1/10). Having two 8s is slightly above average. A safe bid would be 'two 8s', guaranteed by my hand. However, a slightly more assertive opening bid is often strategically better. Bidding 'three 8s' requires the opponent to hold at least one 8 among their 8 digits. The probability of the opponent having at least one 8 is reasonably high (approximately 1 - (0.9)^8 â‰ˆ 57%). This bid leverages my strong holding of 8s while being statistically plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. The maximum number of 8s that could exist is 16. It's possible that there are at least 3 8s between both hands. However, I can bid higher without needing any 8s. I will bid 4 of a digit I have a lot of, which is 2. I have two 2s, so the opponent needs to have at least two 2s for my bid to be valid. This is a slightly risky bid, but better than challenging blindly.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 38681559. The current bid is 4 2s, made by Player 1. I have zero 2s in my hand. For the bid of 4 2s to be true, Player 1 must have at least four 2s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having 4 or more of a specific digit (like 2) in an 8-digit hand is statistically very low (less than 1%). Since I hold none of the bid digit, the entire quantity must be held by the opponent, making the bid highly unlikely to be true. Therefore, challenging is the most strategically sound action.
