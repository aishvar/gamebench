Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two 0s in my hand, I can start with a conservative bid that reflects my hand strength. Bidding 2 0s is a safe starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (57288741), I have no 0s. The opponent bid '2 0s', which means they're claiming there are at least 2 zeros in total. Since I have no 0s in my hand, and they would need to have at least 2 zeros in their hand for this to be true, it's still quite possible given it's only claiming 2 out of 8 possible digits in their hand. Rather than challenge, I should make a conservative higher bid based on what I can see in my hand. I see two 8s in my hand, so bidding '2 8s' would be safe and valid (same quantity but higher digit than '2 0s').

Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand (from my hand: 04639530). The current bid is 2 8s. Since I only have one 8, it's possible the other player has at least one 8, making the bid valid. However, bidding higher is safer than challenging here. I can increase the quantity to 3 8s, which is a reasonable next step.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand (57288741). The opponent bid '3 8s', suggesting they have at least one 8 in their hand. Since I know there are definitely two 8s in my hand, and the opponent confidently bid three 8s, their bid is very likely valid. Given this, challenging would be risky. I should make a higher bid. I could bid '3 9s', but since I don't have any 9s, that would be risky. Instead, I'll bid '4 0s' - while I don't have any 0s, increasing the quantity gives me room to force the opponent to bid higher, and they previously bid on 0s which might indicate they have some.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. The current bid is 4 0s. Since I already have two, it's possible the opponent has two as well, making the total four. However, bidding higher would require either increasing the quantity to 5 or keeping the quantity at 4 and raising the digit. Given that 0 is already the lowest digit, I can't raise the digit without increasing the quantity. Bidding 5 0s seems risky as it's unlikely the opponent has three 0s. Therefore, I should challenge the current bid of 4 0s.
