Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. The digit '0' appears twice in my hand. Assuming the opponent has a similar distribution, a bid of 'Q D' (quantity 2 of digit 0) is a safe starting point. This bid is low enough to be likely true but high enough to start the bidding process.

Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. The digit '0' appears twice in my hand. Assuming the opponent has a similar distribution, a bid of 3 for the digit '0' is reasonable and safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 3/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two '5's in my hand. Assuming the opponent has a similar distribution, bidding '5' with a quantity of 2 is a safe start.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 fives. Looking at my hand (8 3 4 3 7 1 3 5), I have one 5. Since the total bid is 2 fives, for this to be true, the opponent would need to have at least one 5, which is quite plausible. Therefore, challenging now is risky. The safe move is to raise the bid. The minimal valid higher bid is 2 6s (same quantity, higher digit), or 3 of any digit. I will conservatively select 2 6s as the next bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 6s'. I have no 6s in my hand, but I do have two 5s. Since the opponent bid '2 6s', it's likely they have at least one 6. However, challenging '2 6s' might be risky because the opponent could have one 6. Instead, I can safely bid 'Q D' because there are guaranteed to be at least 8 digits in total across both hands, and it's unlikely the opponent has more than one 9.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. The opponent could potentially have up to 2 6s, but it's unlikely they have more than 2. Challenging the bid seems risky because the opponent might have the 6s. However, bidding higher with a digit I have more of, like 5s, is a safer strategy. I have 2 5s in my hand, and it's unlikely the opponent has more than 2 5s. Therefore, I will bid 3 5s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 83437135, which contains two 5s. The current bid is 3 5s, so across both hands, there must be at least 3 fives. Since I have two, Player 0 needs to have at least one 5 for their bid to be valid. This is plausible. To avoid risking a challenge on a reasonable bid, I should either raise or challenge if I think 3 5s is unlikely. Given that 3 is quite reasonable, challenging now is risky. The next higher bid must be at least 3 6s (digit increase) or 4 of any digit. I have two 3s in my hand, so bidding 4 3s would be aggressive but plausible, but not safer. I have two 3s, one 8, two 5s, two 3s, two 7s, one 1, one 4. The safest next bid is 3 6s, but I previously bid that, and Player 0 shifted digits back to 5s, likely because they have more 5s. Alternatively, I can bid 4 3s or 4 5s. Since I have two 5s, and the opponent likely has at least one or two, bidding 4 5s is plausible and the safest escalation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have 2 fives in my hand. Since the opponent has bid 4 5s, it is likely that they have at least 3 fives in their hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16, and considering the bids so far, it is plausible that the opponent could have 4 fives. However, challenging now seems risky because the opponent might actually have 4 fives. Therefore, I will make a bid that is slightly higher but still plausible, aiming to put pressure on the opponent while minimizing risk.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have 2 fives in my hand. The opponent could have up to 2 fives as well, making a total of 6 fives possible. Since the maximum possible quantity is 16, and the opponent's bid of 4 5s seems reasonable but not guaranteed, I will challenge the bid.
