Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 59131574. I can count that I have two 5s and one 9, among other digits. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but not too low. Since I have two 5s, bidding on 5s seems like a good start. I'll bid 3 5s as it's a relatively safe starting point, considering the total count of digits is 16.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 5s, but I do have two 8s and two 6s. The current bid is 3 5s, which I find plausible, but I can confidently raise the bid to 3 8s based on my two 8s, as it only requires the opponent to have at least one 8 for the bid to be likely valid. This is a safe incremental bid that increases the digit without increasing the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. The previous bid was 3 5s, and I had two 5s. Player 1 increased the digit to 8, likely because they have at least one 8. Since I don't have any 8s and there are 8 digits per player, it's possible they have more than one 8 or are bluffing. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Bidding 4 8s seems too high since I'm not confident in having more than three 8s in total. However, I can bid 3 9s, which is a higher digit. I'll take a cautious approach and bid 3 9s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s and zero 9s. The current bid is 3 9s. Since I have no 9s, for the bid to be valid, Player 0 would need at least 3 9s in their hand. Given that the average count of any digit across both hands is about 1.6, the likelihood of Player 0 having all 3 or more 9s is quite low. Therefore, it's statistically unlikely that there are at least 3 9s in total, making this a good opportunity to challenge.
