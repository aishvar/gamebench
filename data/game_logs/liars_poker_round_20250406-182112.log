Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 67495138. I can see that I have one 6, one 7, one 4, one 9, one 5, one 1, one 3, and one 8. The digit distribution in my hand is quite diverse. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the count of any digit I have. I have multiple digits appearing once, so bidding on the count of one of these digits seems reasonable. I'll start by bidding on '2 1s' because it's a relatively low quantity and I have one 1, making it a somewhat informed guess.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have one 2 in my hand, so the total count of 2s is at least 1. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 5 and a 9 in my hand, and there are already 2 2s bid, I can reasonably bid higher. I will increase the quantity to 3 and keep the digit at 2, as it's a relatively safe and conservative move given the information I have.
