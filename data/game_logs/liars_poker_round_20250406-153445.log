Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 72317591, which contains two 1s, one 5, one 7, one 2, one 3, and one 9. I'll start by bidding on a digit that I have, increasing the chances that the total count is higher. I have multiple digits, so I'll choose a relatively common digit in my hand. Bidding 2 1s seems reasonable as it is a conservative start and I have two 1s.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 1s, so the current bid of 2 1s is plausible but uncertain. However, I have two 2s and two 4s, which makes a bid involving those digits safer. To outbid 2 1s, I can bid 2 2s (same quantity, higher digit), leveraging my known cards. This is a safe incremental raise that forces the opponent to either challenge or increase the risk.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 2S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I see one 2, bidding 2 3s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and is still a relatively conservative bid given the information I have.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 3S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 4, 8, 4, 9, 6, 6, 2, 2. I have no 3s, so the current bid of 2 3s relies entirely on Player 0 having at least two 3s, which is plausible but uncertain. Since I have two 2s, a safe and natural higher bid would be 2 4s or 2 6s, but to strictly increase, I need to bid at least 2 4s (higher digit with same quantity) or 3 of any digit. I have two 4s and two 6s, so bidding 3 4s is reasonable, assuming Player 0 might have at least one 4. This raises the quantity and is supported by my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 4S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. My hand is 72317591, which contains one 4. So, I have some information about one of the 4s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I see one 4, it's plausible there are more. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit without increasing the quantity, making it a relatively safe bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (48496622), I have two 2s, two 4s, two 6s, one 8, and one 9. The current bid is 3 5s, and I have zero 5s, so I cannot confidently raise on 5s. However, I have two 6s, so bidding 3 6s is a minimal raise but not strictly higher. To outbid, I can bid 3 6s (same quantity, higher digit), which is a valid higher bid. Since I hold two 6s, it's plausible there is at least one more 6 in the opponent's hand, making 3 6s a reasonable and safe incremental raise.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 7, two 1s, one 5, and one 9 in my hand, with no 6s. The bid history indicates an escalating quantity and digit. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 6s, and the quantity is already 3, I should bid a higher digit with the same quantity or more. Bidding 3 7s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit and is based on my hand having a 7.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (48496622), I have two 2s, two 4s, two 6s, one 8, and one 9. The current bid is 3 7s. Since I have zero 7s, the opponent must have at least three 7s for the bid to be valid, which is unlikely given only eight digits in their hand. The probability that they have three or more 7s is quite low. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
