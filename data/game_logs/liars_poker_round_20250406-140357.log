Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (40019509), I have one 0, two 0s, one 1, one 4, one 5, one 9. Since there's no current bid, I need to make the first bid. I want to bid based on digits I have in my hand to increase confidence. I have two 0s, which is a good start. Considering all three players have 8 digits each (24 total), and assuming a somewhat even distribution, there might be around 2-3 of each digit in total. Since I already have two 0s, I'll bid conservatively that there are at least 3 0s total, which seems very reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I need to consider the total number of digits and the possibility of other players having 0s. Given that I have one 0 in my hand, I should assess if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I must evaluate the likelihood of the current bid being exceeded by my hand or if challenging is more prudent.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 8 and no 0s in my hand. The bid of 4 0s is already quite high, suggesting that there are likely some 0s distributed among the other players. However, bidding 4 1s would be a safe and reasonable move as it's a higher digit than 0. I will bid 4 1s.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand (the fourth digit). The current bid is 4 1s, which means there need to be at least 4 1s total across all players' hands. For this to be true, the other two players would need to have at least 3 more 1s between them. This is certainly possible. Looking at my own hand, I have two 0s, one 1, one 4, one 5, one 9, and two unknowns. I could bid 5 1s, but that's risky since I only have one 1. I could also increase the digit and bid 4 2s, 4 3s, etc., but I don't have any of those digits in my hand. I do have one 4, one 5, and one 9, so I could bid 4 4s, 4 5s, or 4 9s. Of these, 4 9s is the safest since 9 is the highest digit. Even if I'm challenged, there's a chance the other players have some 9s as well.

Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I need to assess the likelihood of there being 4 or more 9s in total. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and there are 3 players with 8 secret digits each, I should consider the possibility of there being 4 or more 9s. However, without knowing the exact distribution, I must make an educated guess. My hand contains one 9, and I have no information about the other players' hands. I will increase the quantity slightly and choose a higher digit to make a valid and reasonably safe bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand (65425878). To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll analyze my hand. I see that I have digits ranging from 2 to 8. The current bid of 5 0s is relatively low considering there are 24 digits in total. However, increasing the quantity to 6 or more for 0s seems challenging given that I only have one 0. I can bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. I have multiple digits that could be bid on with a quantity of 5. For instance, I can see that I have an 8, so bidding 5 8s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit significantly.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current state carefully. In my hand, I have 40019509, which contains one 0, two 1s, one 4, one 5, one 9, and no 8s. The current bid is '5 8s'. Looking at the bid history, Player 1 and Player 2 have been increasing bids, with Player 2 jumping to 5 8s. To have 5 8s total, the other two players would need to have 5 8s between them since I have none. This is possible but somewhat unlikely given the random distribution. The total number of digits in play is 24 (8 per player), so 5 8s would mean about 21% of all digits are 8s. I could bid 6 0s (I have one 0), 6 1s (I have two 1s), or some other higher quantity, but I'm skeptical about the 5 8s claim. Given that I have no 8s in my hand and the relatively high quantity being claimed, I think challenging is the better move here.
