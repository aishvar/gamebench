Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 4s, making it relatively safe to start with a modest bid involving 4s. Since there is no current bid, a conservative bid of 3 4s is reasonable, accounting for my two and assuming at least one more is in my opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '4' in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s, which means there must be at least two more '4's in the opponent's hand. Given that the opponent has 8 digits, it's plausible but not certain. To be safe, I can increase the bid to a digit I have more of, like '5's, of which I have two. Bidding 3 5s is a higher bid than 3 4s and is based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 28035447, containing only one digit '5'. The current bid is '3 5s', meaning at least three '5's must exist between both players. Since I have just one '5', Player 1 must have at least two '5's for their bid to be valid. Given they raised from my previous bid of '3 4s' to '3 5s', it's plausible they have at least two '5's in their hand. However, since I can't be certain, and the bid is still relatively low (3 out of 16 total digits), challenging seems risky. Instead, I can safely increase the bid slightly to a digit I hold multiple of. I have two '4's in my hand, and previously bid '3 4s', which Player 1 did not challenge. Therefore, bidding '4 4s' is reasonable and safer, as I already hold two '4's, needing only two more from Player 1.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '4' in my hand. The current bid is '4 4s', which means there must be at least four '4s' in total. Since I only have one, it's unlikely the opponent has three '4s' to meet the bid. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
