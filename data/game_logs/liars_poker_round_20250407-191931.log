Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current state of the game, I have not yet seen any bids. The maximum possible quantity is 16, and I have a good mix of digits in my hand. To increase the chances of making a valid higher bid, I should start by bidding on a high-digit quantity. Since my hand has 3 instances of the digit 9, I'll bid on the digit 9.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I'm starting the game, so I'll make a bid on a digit that I'm likely to have in my hand. Based on the rules, I'll choose a digit that's not too high, but still has a good chance of being in my hand. I'll bid on the digit '3' which appears twice in my hand. This is a conservative bid, but it's a good starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. Looking at my hand (3 2 7 7 0 1 4 8), I have one '3'. For Player 0's bid of 2 3s to be valid, there must be at least one more '3' in Player 0's hand. Since having two or more '3's in their hand is quite plausible, the bid of 2 3s is reasonable and not worth challenging. Therefore, the optimal move is to raise the bid. The smallest valid raise is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, such as 2 4s, or increase the quantity for the same digit, 3 3s. Since I have no '4's but only one '3', increasing the count of '3's to 3 would be risky. Instead, I will bid 2 7s, because I have two '7's in my hand, making this bid likely valid and a safe incremental bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a lower quantity of 7s (0) compared to the current bid (2) and a higher quantity of 3s (1) compared to the previous bid (0). I should challenge the current bid as it's unlikely to be correct.
