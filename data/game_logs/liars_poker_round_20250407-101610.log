Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn and the current bid is 'None', so I must make the first bid. My hand is 46129236. I have two 6s and two 2s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. The total number of digits in play is 16 (2 players * 8 digits). The expected number of any digit is 1.6. Having two 6s is slightly above average. Bidding '3 6s' implies there is at least one more 6 among the opponent's 8 digits. This is statistically plausible (probability of opponent having at least one 6 is 1 - (9/10)^8 ≈ 57%). It's a reasonable opening bid based on my hand, slightly assertive but not overly risky.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand (48037705). The opponent bid 3 6s, requiring all three to be in their 8-digit hand. The probability of having ≥3 of a specific digit in 8 random digits is low (~4% chance). Given the low likelihood and my ability to challenge immediately, challenging is strategically sound.
