Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand 73523621, I have two 2s, two 3s, two 1s, one 5, one 6, and one 7. Statistically, the most common digits in my hand are 1s, 2s, and 3s, each appearing twice. Given that there are 16 digits in total, starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid of 3 2s leverages my two 2s and expects the opponent might have at least one more.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. My hand has 0 2s, so the opponent must have at least 3 2s in their 8 digits. Achieving 3 2s in 8 digits is possible but statistically unlikely. Challenging reduces the risk of overcommitting to a higher bid without sufficient evidence.
