Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have the digits 4, 5, 1, 1, 7, 4, 6, and 0 in my hand. Since there are no previous bids, I need to start with a reasonable bid. I can bid 2 1s, as I have two 1s in my hand. This is a valid starting bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 1s, making it less likely that there are more than 2 total 1s across both hands. However, since the current bid is only 2 1s, this is quite plausible given 16 digits in total. Challenging now would be risky. Instead, I can safely increase the bid by keeping the quantity at 2 and choosing a digit I have multiple of to maintain a credible bid. I have two 8s, so bidding 2 8s is a safe incremental raise.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4 and two 1s in my hand, but I do not have any 8s. The current bid is 2 8s, which is very likely to be overstated since I can't contribute to that count. I should challenge the bid because it's unlikely that there are two 8s among both of our hands.
