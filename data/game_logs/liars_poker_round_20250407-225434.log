Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 54483803, I notice that I have multiple occurrences of the digit 8 and other digits. A safe and reasonable starting bid would be to choose a digit I have at least one of and bid a low quantity, considering the total possible occurrences across both hands is 16. Since I have an 8, bidding on 8s seems like a good starting point. Given that I only have one 8 and we're just starting, I'll start with a low quantity to avoid overbidding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, which requires at least one more 8 from the opponent. However, challenging now would only succeed if the opponent has zero 8s (43% probability). Alternatively, bidding 3 6s leverages my two 6s, requiring the opponent to have just one 6 (57% probability), making it a statistically safer bid than challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 3 6s and I need to make a strictly higher bid, I have to consider either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains no 6s but does contain multiple 8s, bidding on a higher digit that I have more information on seems wise. However, I must also consider the likelihood of the digits based on the bids made. The bid of 3 6s suggests Player 1 might have at least one 6, but without more information, it's hard to assess the likelihood of this bid being true. Given my hand has two 8s and considering the bid history started with 2 8s, it might be reasonable to increase the quantity of a digit I have knowledge of, but since I must bid higher than 3 6s, I need to think about digits higher than 6 or increasing the quantity significantly for a lower digit. However, challenging seems like a viable option if I think the current bid is unlikely, but given I have no 6s and the bid is not extremely high, it might not be the best strategy without more information on the opposing player's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, meaning Player 0 needs at least two 8s in their hand for the bid to be valid. While possible, holding two 8s in an 8-card hand is not highly probable. Given the risk of overcommitting with a higher bid and the uncertainty of Player 0's actual holdings, challenging the bid is strategically safer here.
