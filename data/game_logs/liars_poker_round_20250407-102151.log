Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) making initial bid: 1 0s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 1 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Since I have two 2s and two 7s, increasing the bid to 2 2s is a safe and natural progression, raising the quantity and choosing a digit I hold multiples of, which increases the credibility of my bid.

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 2 3s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 2, 6, 7, 1, 7, 9, 2, 8. I have zero 3s, so the current bid of 2 3s depends entirely on Player 0's hand. Since Player 0 is a naive bidder and they upped the bid from 2 2s to 2 3s, it is likely they have at least one 3, but unlikely they have two. The probability that there are at least two 3s overall is low given I have none. Therefore, challenging now is a good strategic move.
