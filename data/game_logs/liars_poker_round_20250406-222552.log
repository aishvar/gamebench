Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I reviewed my hand (79030924) and noticed I hold two 9s. With no current bid, it's a safe and strong opening move to bid '2 9s', as I am certain of having at least two 9s. This bid is both credible and forces any future bid to increase in quantity, providing a strategic edge.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 9s. Since I know there is at least one 9, I can confidently raise the bid. I can bid 3 9s, which is a valid increase in quantity while keeping the same digit. This seems a reasonable move based on my hand.
