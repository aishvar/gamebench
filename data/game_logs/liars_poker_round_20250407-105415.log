Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Since there are 16 digits in total and I hold two 3s, two 6s, and one 5, 9, and 8, it's safer to increase the bid on a digit I have multiple of. I will raise the bid to 2 6s, as I hold two 6s myself, making this bid very safe and strictly higher than 1 0s.
