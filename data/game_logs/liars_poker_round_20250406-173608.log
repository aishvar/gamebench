Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 0s (digits: 8,2,0,0,7,8,3,0). Since the current bid is only 1 0s, and I alone have three, it's very safe to increase the bid. The next strictly higher bid would be 2 0s, but given my strong hand, I can confidently jump to 3 0s.

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 1s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 0s and zero 1s in my hand. The current bid is 3 1s, which requires at least three 1s across both hands. Since I have no 1s, all three would have to be in Player 0's hand, which is unlikely. Given this, challenging is the best move.
