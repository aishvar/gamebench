Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s and two 1s, which are the most frequent digits. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will choose 2 9s, reflecting my own hand strength and putting some pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 87915931, I have no 0s, which makes Player 1's bid of 3 0s quite suspicious. Since I hold zero 0s, for their bid to be valid, they must have all three 0s themselves, which is unlikely given the distribution. The probability of three or more 0s in their hand is low, so challenging here is a strong move.
