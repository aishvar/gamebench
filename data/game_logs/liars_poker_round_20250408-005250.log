Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 7, one 8, and one 4 (two 4s total). The most promising digit to start with is 4, as I hold two of them. A conservative but solid opening bid is 2 4s, reflecting my hand strength and putting some pressure on the opponent to either raise quantity or digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. I have two 5s. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable increase in quantity while also using a digit I possess. It's a calculated risk, as it's higher than the current bid, but not excessively high.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 74320814, I have no 5s, so the 3 5s bid relies entirely on the opponent having at least 3, which is plausible but uncertain. Since I have two 4s, I know there are at least two 4s in total. A safe and higher bid would be 3 6s or 3 8s, but I have only one 8 and no 6s, making those less supported. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 4 and pick a digit I have some of. I have two 4s, so bidding 4 4s is somewhat risky but possible. However, it's safer to bid 3 8s since I have one 8 and the opponent might have two. Therefore, I will raise to 3 8s, which is a strictly higher bid (same quantity, higher digit).

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. Given the previous bids of 2 4s and 3 5s, a bid of 3 8s seems plausible but potentially aggressive. I could bid higher, but challenging seems like a good option as it's unlikely there are three 8s in total. I'm opting to challenge as I have no 8s and it's a relatively high bid.
