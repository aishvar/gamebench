Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, which makes it less likely that there are many zeros overall, but the current bid is only 1 zero, which is quite plausible given 16 digits in play. It's too risky to challenge such a low opening bid. The next minimum valid bid is 1 1s. I have two 3s and two 4s, so a safe incremental bid would be 1 4s, but since I have two 4s, I can confidently raise to 2 4s. This is a reasonable, safe raise above the initial bid.
