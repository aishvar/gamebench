--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid. I have 8 digits: 7, 5, 4, 8, 0, 8, 9, 1. The most frequent digit in my hand is 8, appearing twice. The total number of digits in play is 16 (2 players * 8 digits). The expected number of any digit is 1.6. Since I have two 8s, bidding '2 8s' is a safe opening bid, as it's true based solely on my hand. It's a low bid that doesn't require the opponent to have any 8s, but signals I might hold some.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have no 8s in my hand, so the total count of 8s is either from Player 0's hand. Challenging this bid could be effective if Player 0 has fewer than two 8s.
