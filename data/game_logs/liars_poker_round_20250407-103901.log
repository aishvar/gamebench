Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. I could bid 3 0s, but that seems weak. Given the naive opponent, challenging might be the best strategy if they are bluffing. However, since it's still a low bid, it's safer to increase the bid slightly. I'll bid 3 0s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I don't have any 1s in my hand. Bidding higher is necessary. I can bid 3 of a higher number, or a higher quantity of any number. I have two 6s. The previous bid was 3 0s. I can bid 3 2s, 3 3s, 3 4s, 3 5s, 3 6s, 3 7s, 3 8s, or 3 9s. I can also bid 4 0s, 4 1s, etc. Bidding 4 2s seems like a safe increase.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I don't have any 3s in my hand. To make a valid bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. I could bid 4 of a higher digit, or 5 of any digit. Since the game is progressing and the bids are increasing, I will bid 5 0s. This is a safe bid as I have a 0 in my hand.
