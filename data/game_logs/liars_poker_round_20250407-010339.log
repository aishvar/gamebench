Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and the bidding is currently 'None'. My hand is 45935020. I have two 5s and two 0s, which are my most frequent digits. The total number of digits in play is 16 (2 players * 8 digits). The expected average count for any digit is 1.6. Since I have two 5s, bidding '2 5s' is a safe and truthful opening bid based on my hand. It establishes a low baseline for the bidding.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand (69598810). Since the opponent bid '2 5s', they likely have at least one 5 as well. Given this is a relatively low and safe bid, I could continue bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, which gives me confidence to bid '2 8s' - keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit.

Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. My hand is 45935020, containing zero 8s. For the current bid to be true, the opponent must hold at least two 8s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, challenging a bid of quantity 2 is often risky early in the game. I need to make a higher bid. Options include 2 9s or increasing the quantity to 3. I hold two 0s and two 5s. Bidding 3 0s is a statistically reasonable increase, as it only requires the opponent to have one 0 among their 8 digits, and it leverages a digit I hold multiples of.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The opponent bid 3 0s, implying they believe there are at least 3 zeros total. Given I only have one 0, they would need at least 2 zeros in their hand for this to be true. While possible, I can make a safer bid by using what I know about my hand. I see I have two 8s, and I've already established this earlier with my '2 8s' bid. I can confidently bid '3 1s' which is higher than '3 0s' while keeping the same quantity.

Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 45935020. The current bid is 3 1s. I have zero 1s in my hand. For the current bid to be true, my opponent must hold at least three 1s out of their 8 digits. While possible, this is not guaranteed. Alternatively, I can make a higher bid. I hold two 5s. Bidding '3 5s' is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid only requires my opponent to hold at least one 5 for it to be true, which is statistically probable (8 digits / 10 possibilities). This seems like a strong bid based on my hand, leveraging my two 5s, and is preferable to challenging the relatively low bid of 3 1s.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand, and the opponent bid 3 5s total. Given my hand, there would need to be at least two more 5s in the opponent's hand to make this bid valid. While possible, I have better information - I see two 8s in my hand. I can make a safer bid of '3 8s' which I know is definitely true based on my hand alone, and it's a higher digit than 5s with the same quantity.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand (45935020). For the bid to be true, Player 1 must have at least three 8s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, challenging seems premature as 3 is not a very high quantity out of 16 total digits. I should make a higher bid. Options are 3 9s or increasing the quantity to 4. I have one 9, so bidding 3 9s would require Player 1 to have at least two 9s. I have two 0s and two 5s. Bidding 4 0s or 4 5s leverages my hand strength. Both require Player 1 to have at least two of that digit. I previously bid 3 0s and 3 5s, and Player 1 bid over them, possibly indicating they don't hold many of those digits, or they could be bluffing. Bidding 4 0s seems like a strong move based on my hand, increasing the quantity and putting pressure on the opponent. It requires two 0s from Player 1's 8 digits, which is plausible.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) bids: 4 0s

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand I have one 0, and the opponent bid '4 0s'. Given the bid history, they've been gradually increasing quantities and seem confident. Since there are 16 total digits and I only have one 0, it's quite possible they have 3 or more 0s to support their bid. I have multiple 8s in my hand (two 8s), so I can make a safer bid of '4 8s' which is valid as it keeps the same quantity but uses a higher digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand is 45935020, which contains zero 8s. For the bid of 4 8s to be true, the other player (Player 1) must have at least four 8s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, requiring half of the opponent's hand to be a specific digit when I hold none of that digit makes the bid suspect. Player 1 has consistently bid on 8s (2 8s, 3 8s, 4 8s), which could indicate strength or a persistent bluff. Given I have no 8s to support the current bid, challenging seems statistically favorable compared to making a higher bid like 5 0s (requiring 3 from opponent) or 5 5s (requiring 3 from opponent), especially since Player 1's previous bid of 3 1s might suggest they don't hold many 0s or 5s either. The risk of Player 1 actually holding 4 or more 8s seems lower than the risk associated with escalating the bid further based on my hand.
