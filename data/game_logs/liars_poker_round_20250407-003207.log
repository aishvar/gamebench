--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first turn, so there are no existing bids. I have two 6s in my hand, which is a relatively common digit. Starting with a bid of 3 6s seems reasonable, as it accounts for my hand and leaves room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which means there must be at least two more 6s in Player 0's hand. Given that I only have one 6, it's unlikely that Player 0 has two more 6s. However, to advance the game and based on the rules, I can either bid higher or challenge. Since I cannot make a higher bid with the 6s (as I only have one), and challenging might be risky without more information, I will make a higher bid with a different digit. I have two 2s, so bidding 4 2s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand, and the current bid is 4 2s. This means there must be at least three more 2s in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. While this is possible, it seems somewhat unlikely. Instead of bidding higher and risking an overreach, I will challenge the current bid to test its validity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) challenges Player 1's (cohere/command-a:floor) bid of 4 2s.
