Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. I'll start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 3s, so bidding 2 3s seems reasonable.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have 3 4s in my hand. The current bid is only 2 3s. Bidding 3 4s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have a hand with digits: 2, 9, 7, 1, 4, 9, 0, 3. I can see if I have any 4s or higher digits that could influence my decision. I have one 4 in my hand. The bid seems low but I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since I only have one 4, I will assess if bidding higher is feasible or if challenging is more prudent.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have 4 in my hand, which is the digit being bid on. I should increase both the quantity and digit to make a valid higher bid. Bidding 5 4s seems reasonable, as I have 4 in my hand and it's a logical increase from the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 4S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 2, 9, 7, 1, 4, 9, 0, 3. I have a total of 2 fours, but I also see other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. The current bid is 5 4s, so I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 4s and two other digits that could potentially match or exceed the current bid if I had more information about my opponent's hand. However, I can see that bidding 6 4s or higher would be risky without knowing the distribution of digits in the opponent's hand. A safer and higher bid would be to increase the digit rather than the quantity, considering I have two 4s and could potentially match or exceed the quantity if needed.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s, and I have two 5s in my hand. I should bid on a higher quantity or digit to increase the chance of winning. Since I don't have any other digits in high quantity, I'll bid on the digit that is higher than 5, which is 6. I have one 6 in my hand, so bidding 3 6s seems reasonable.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 7 5s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 5S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 7 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 5s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that this bid can be beaten. My hand contains the digits 2, 9, 7, 1, 4, 9, 0, 3. I have a total of 2 fives, but I also have other digits that could contribute to a higher count if I were to bid on a different digit. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and the current bid is 7 5s, I should consider if I can safely bid higher or challenge. Since I have two 9s and the current bid does not seem excessively high, I could consider bidding on a higher digit or increasing the quantity. However, without exact counts of other digits in Player 1's hand, I must make an educated guess. I have two 9s, which could potentially be part of a higher bid if I choose a digit that is less likely to have a high count.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 8 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. I have one 6 in my hand, and the previous bids have been increasing in quantity. Given my hand, bidding 9 6s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand and the trend of previous bids.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 9 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 6s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is the best option. My hand contains the digits 2, 9, 7, 1, 4, 9, 0, 3. I have two 9s and two 6s but no 6s that I can add to the bid to make it significantly higher. The bid of 9 6s seems high but I do not have enough information about Player 1's hand. However, I can see if my digits can help me make a higher bid or if challenging seems more reasonable.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 10 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 6s. I have a 6 in my hand. While I don't know the exact distribution of digits across all players' hands, bidding 11 6s is a reasonable increase in quantity, considering the current bid. This way, I'm attempting to outbid the current bid without committing to a specific digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 11 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 11 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 11 6s. I have a hand with several 6s and other digits. Given that I have two 6s in my hand and the total number of 6s could reasonably be higher than 11, I should consider if there's a possibility that the total count of 6s across both hands could be less than 11. However, without exact knowledge of Player 1's hand, I must make an educated guess. The bid seems high but not impossible. I have a 6 in my hand, and if Player 1 has a significant number of 6s, the total could indeed be 11 or more. I will challenge this bid as it seems unlikely but not impossible. However, given my hand and the bidding history, I think it's a good opportunity to challenge.
