Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, making it unlikely there are many 0s overall. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, it's very plausible the opponent has one 0. Challenging now would be risky because it's quite likely they do have at least one 0. The minimum higher bid is 1 1s. I have one '1' in my hand, so bidding 1 1s is reasonable and safe, incrementing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 9, 4, 7, 2, 2, 5, 7, 8, which includes two 2s. The current bid is 1 2s, which I know is valid since I alone have two 2s. A strictly higher bid would be either 2 2s or 1 3s or higher. Since I hold two 2s, it's safe and strategic to raise to 2 2s, reflecting my known count and putting pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 94722578, I have no 3s, so the current bid of 2 3s relies entirely on the opponent's hand. Since 2 out of 16 total digits is very plausible, challenging now would be premature. The minimum valid raise is either 3 of any digit or 2 of a higher digit. I have two 2s, so bidding 3 2s is relatively safe because with my two 2s, it's likely there is at least one more 2 in the opponent's hand. Therefore, I will increase the quantity to 3 and choose 2s, making a safe but progressive bid.

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 94722578, I have two 2s and one 7, 4, 5, 8, and 9, but no 3s. The current bid is 3 3s. Since I have zero 3s, the likelihood that my opponent has all three or more 3s is relatively low. Statistically, having three or more of a specific digit across 16 total digits is plausible but less likely when I hold none. Therefore, challenging the bid is a reasonable choice.
