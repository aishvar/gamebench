Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. In my hand, I have two 1s and two 2s, which are the most frequent digits. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 2s, reflecting my hand and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '2' in my hand. The current bid is 2 2s, which means there needs to be at least one more '2' in the opponent's hand. Since the bid is low and I have one '2', it's reasonable to assume the opponent might have at least one '2' as well. To increase the bid safely, I can bid 3 2s, which is a higher quantity but still plausible given the current information.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 70121284, I have three 2s. The current bid is 3 2s, which exactly matches my count, so it's plausible. Since I hold all three 2s myself, it's unlikely the opponent has more, but they might. To increase pressure, a safe next bid could be 3 3s or 3 4s, but since I have one 4 and one 8, bidding 3 4s is reasonable as it's plausible both hands combined have at least three 4s. This raises the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '4' in my hand. The current bid is 3 '4's. Since I only have one, it's unlikely that the opponent has two more '4's to make the total count at least three. Therefore, challenging the bid seems like the best move.
