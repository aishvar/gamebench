Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (98417231), I have two 1s. A reasonable starting bid would be slightly higher than what I have, to allow room for further bidding. I'll bid 3 1s, which is a conservative but valid starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have no 1s in my hand, which makes the bid somewhat plausible, but not overwhelmingly so. I have two 5s, two 6s, two 7s and three 8s. Bidding 4 1s is a safe increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have, such as 4 5s or 4 6s, but that might reveal information about my hand too early. Given the low initial bid, increasing the quantity seems like the most sensible option.

Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 1s. Since I only have three 1s, it's unlikely there are four 1s in total. However, I can't make a higher bid for 1s with the same quantity. Instead, I can either challenge or bid a higher quantity for a different digit. Given the current bid, challenging seems reasonable, but I also have two 2s, which could allow me to bid 5 2s, increasing both quantity and digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 2S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 5 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. Bidding higher than 5 for any digit seems risky without knowing the opponent's hand. However, I have two 5s, two 6s, two 7s and three 8s. Bidding 6 5s is a reasonable increase in quantity and doesn't rely on the opponent having a lot of 5s. It's a slightly conservative bid, but safer than challenging with no 2s in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 5S'
Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 6 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 6 5s, which implies there are at least six 5s in total. Given that I only have one 5, the opponent would need five 5s to make the bid valid. This seems unlikely, as it would be an unusually high number of 5s for one player. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
