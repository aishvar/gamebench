Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: For my opening bid, I should analyze my own hand first. Looking at my digits (86798234): I have two 8s, one 6, one 7, one 9, one 2, one 3, and one 4. Since I have two 8s and know there could be more 8s in the opponent's hand (up to 8 more possible), making a conservative opening bid of three 8s would be a reasonable strategy. This is a safe opening bid because I can see two 8s myself, and only need one more 8 from my opponent's eight digits to make this bid valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (Random(openrouter/google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free)), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 27533914. The current bid is '3 8s'. I have zero 8s in my hand. For the current bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least three 8s in their 8-digit hand. This is possible, but not highly probable for an opening bid. Challenging is a viable option. However, I can also make a higher bid. I need to bid either more than 3 of a digit, or 3 of a digit higher than 8 (i.e., 3 9s). Looking at my hand, I have two 3s. Bidding '4 3s' is a relatively safe and strong bid. For this bid to be true, the opponent only needs to have two 3s among their 8 digits, which is statistically plausible (around 25% chance for exactly two 3s, plus chances for more). Bidding '3 9s' requires the opponent to have two 9s (I have one 9). Bidding '4 3s' leverages my strongest digit count (two 3s) and requires a reasonable contribution from the opponent. It's a better option than challenging immediately, as it puts pressure back on the opponent and is based on my hand's strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I can see my entire hand (86798234) which contains only one 3. For the opponent's bid of '4 3s' to be true, they would need 3 more 3s in their hand. While possible, I can use the bid history to gain more insight. My opening bid of '3 8s' was based on me having two 8s, meaning I expected one more 8 in their hand. Instead of raising on 8s, they switched to 3s, suggesting they likely don't have many 3s. Given I only have one 3, and their bidding behavior suggests they may be bluffing, their claim of 4 total 3s seems unlikely.
