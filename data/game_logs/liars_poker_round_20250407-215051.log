Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must open the bidding. The best opening bid typically targets a digit I have multiple times, maximizing the likelihood the total count is at least that number. My hand contains two 8s, two 3s, two 6s, and one 2 and one 4. Opening with '2 3s' or '2 8s' is a solid conservative start, but 3s are common digits and can be safer statistically. Therefore, I will open with '2 3s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 3s'. I have the digits 7, 5, 9, 2, 1, 0, 1, 6 in my hand. There are no '3s' in my hand, which means I cannot contribute to that count. Given that there are only 16 total digits (8 from each player), and I have no 3s, it's unlikely that Player 0 has enough 3s to meet the bid of 2. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
