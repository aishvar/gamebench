--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my first turn. I need to make an initial bid. I will analyze my hand to determine a good starting bid. My hand contains the digits: 0, 7, 6, 8, 9, 5, 8, 9. The digit '8' appears twice, which is the highest count of any single digit in my hand. I will start with a bid of '2 8s' because it's a conservative bid that reflects a possible strength without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (52343371), I have zero 8s. The current bid is 2 8s, so for that bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least two 8s. Since the total digits are 16 and I have none, the chance that the opponent has two or more 8s is relatively low, especially since 8s are less common digits. Rather than risk increasing the bid on a digit I have none of, the best strategic move is to challenge, as the bid is likely an overstatement.
