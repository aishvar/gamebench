Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 89341528. I have two 8s, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. With 16 digits in total between both players, the expected number of any digit is 1.6. Since I have two 8s, it's statistically likely that there is at least one more 8 in the opponent's hand (8 digits * 1/10 = 0.8 expected). Therefore, bidding '3 8s' is a reasonable opening bid based on my hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to evaluate whether to challenge the current bid of '3 8s' or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (62777593), I have one 8 in it. Since there are 16 total digits in the game (8 in my hand and 8 in my opponent's hand), and I can see that I have one 8, there would need to be at least 2 more 8s in my opponent's hand for their bid to be valid. While this is certainly possible, it's not guaranteed. However, rather than challenging immediately, I'll make a higher bid based on what I can see in my hand. I notice I have three 7s in my hand, which means there are at least 3 sevens in the game. I could safely bid '3 7s', but that's not higher than '3 8s' since the digit is lower. Instead, I'll bid '4 0s' which is higher in quantity. Even though I don't have any 0s in my hand, there's a reasonable chance my opponent might have some, and increasing the quantity makes it a valid higher bid.

Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have zero 0s in my hand (89341528). For the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 1) must have at least four 0s in their 8-digit hand. This seems statistically unlikely (requiring half their hand to be 0s). Given I possess none of the bid digit, the probability of the bid being true is lower. Therefore, challenging is the strategically sound move.
