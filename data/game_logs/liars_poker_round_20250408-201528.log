Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. Since there are 16 digits total, it's quite likely there is at least one more 0 in Player 0's hand, making the bid of 1 0s very safe. To raise, the minimal valid higher bid would be 1 1s. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, so bidding 1 1s is reasonable and minimal.
