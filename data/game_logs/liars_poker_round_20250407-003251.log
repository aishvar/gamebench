Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (55207887), I see that I have two 5s and two 8s. Bidding 2 5s or 2 8s is a safe starting point, but to be more aggressive and increase the chances of a higher bid, I'll choose the higher digit, 8.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s would be risky as it relies on my opponent having at least one 8. A safer option is to bid on a digit I have, and increase the quantity. I have two 6s, so bidding 3 6s is a reasonable increase. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have one of, and increase the digit. I have one 7, so I could bid 3 7s. Since 6 is lower than 7, and I have more 6s, 3 6s seems like the more conservative and reasonable bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 6s. Since I only have two 6s, it's unlikely there are three 6s in total. I should challenge the bid to verify the count.
