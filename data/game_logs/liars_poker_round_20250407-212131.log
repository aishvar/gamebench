Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, the digit counts are: 0 (1), 1 (1), 2 (1), 3 (1), 6 (1), 7 (1), 9 (2). The digit 9 appears twice, which is the highest count of any digit in my hand. Statistically, it's reasonable to assume at least 3 total 9's across both hands, but to start conservatively and leave room for raising, I will open with a bid of 2 nines.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 9s'. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains one '9'. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and there are 2 players, if I bid '3 9s', it would be a valid higher bid because it exceeds the quantity of the current bid. However, I must consider if challenging could be more beneficial or if my bid could be credible.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 nines. Looking at my hand (32961079), I have two 9s. Since there are a total of 16 digits in play, Player 1 would need at least one 9 in their hand to make the bid plausible. Having two 9s myself, it's quite likely that at least one more exists in Player 1's hand, making 3 nines a reasonable bid. Therefore, challenging now would be risky. The next valid higher bid would be either 4 of any digit or 3 of a digit higher than 9, but since 9 is the highest digit, only the quantity can be increased. I will raise the bid to 4 9s, which is still plausible given the distribution.

Player 1 response was not valid JSON: '{
  "reasoning": "Analyzing the current bid of '4 9s' and my hand '64456402', I see that I have one '9'. The current bid claims there are at least 4 '9s' in total. Given that I only have 1 '9' and there are 2 players, the maximum possible '9s' I can verify is by assuming the other player has all the '9s' they claimed. If I assume Player 0 has 3 '9s' (which is highly unlikely but possible), that would make 4 '9s' in total. However, I don't have enough information to safely assume there are more than 4 '9s'. My hand does not have a high count of '9s', so bidding higher on '9s' seems risky. However, I can try to bid on a different digit. I have 2 '6s', 2 '4s', and other digits appear once or not at all. A safe bet would be to bid on a digit that I know appears multiple times in my hand. Since I have 2 '6s' and no information about Player 0's '6s', I can bid on '6s'. I have 2 '6s', so bidding '3 6s' seems reasonable as it exceeds the current bid quantity and digit value.",
  "action": "BID: Q D"

However, I must correct that action must follow a specific format and my previous response was not in the correct format for action as per instructions.

Here is the corrected response:

Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (64456402), I see I have one 9. The current bid is 4 9s. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and there are 2 players, I need to assess if bidding higher or challenging is optimal. Since I only have 1 nine, I find it highly unlikely that between both hands there are 4 nines. The current bid seems too high to be valid, so I should challenge.
