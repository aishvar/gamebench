Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. I have two 8s and two 9s in my hand, which are the highest digits I possess. Bidding 4 8s seems reasonable, as it maximizes both quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. The maximum number of 8s possible is 16. 4 8s is a reasonable bid, but I don't have any information to suggest it's incorrect. I will conservatively raise the bid to 5 0s, as I have a 0 in my hand. This is a slightly higher bid and allows me to continue playing without taking a huge risk.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 0s. This means there must be at least three more 0s in Player 1's hand to make the bid valid. Given that each player has only 8 digits, and I already have two 0s, it's unlikely that Player 1 has three more 0s. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
