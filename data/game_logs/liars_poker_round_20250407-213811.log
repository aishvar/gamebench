Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, the digit '8' appears twice, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. Starting with a conservative but solid opening bid that reflects my hand strength, I will bid 2 eights, as it's likely there are more eights in the opponent's hand as well.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 3, 8, 4, 8, 1, 6, 5, 0. Notably, I have zero 9s. The current bid is 2 9s, which means across both hands there should be at least two 9s. Since I have none, the entire bid depends on Player 1 having both 9s, which is unlikely (only a ~5% chance assuming random distribution). Given this low probability, it's strategically better to challenge rather than raise the bid, as it is improbable that two 9s exist in total.
