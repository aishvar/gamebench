Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid and it's my turn, I need to make the first bid. My hand is 32214276, which contains two 2s, one 4, and other digits. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and a conservative estimate. I see I have two 2s, so bidding on 2s seems like a good start. I'll bid 3 2s as it's a slight increase from what I see in my hand, considering there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's, making a total of 16 digits.
