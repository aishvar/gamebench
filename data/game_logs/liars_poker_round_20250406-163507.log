Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s, two 7s, and one 0 in my hand. Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. A reasonable opening bid would be 3 7s, as I already hold two 7s, and it is likely that the opponent has at least one more 7 in their hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '14230895', I have one 7. The current bid is 3 7s, meaning there must be at least three 7s across both hands. Since I only hold one, the opponent would need to have at least two 7s for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution of digits, it's somewhat unlikely that the opponent has two or more 7s. The probability favors a challenge here, as 3 of a specific digit among 16 is already on the higher side, and I hold only one myself.
