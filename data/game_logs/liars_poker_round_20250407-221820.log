Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand 29489532, I notice I have two 9s and two 2s, which are my strongest counts. Opening with a conservative yet reasonable bid of 2 9s leverages my hand and sets a baseline for the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is only 2 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I hold two 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, so for that to be valid, my opponent must have at least one 9. This is plausible, but pushing the bid higher may pressure them. Since I have two 9s, a bid of 4 9s would require my opponent to have at least two 9s, which is less likely given the distribution. Alternatively, I can increase the digit to 3 0s, but that is not higher than 3 9s. Therefore, the only valid higher bid is 4 9s. Considering the distribution, 4 9s is still within reason, so I will make that bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have two 9s in my hand, which supports the bid but doesn't provide a strong basis to increase the quantity or digit. However, I can try to increase the digit to 5, which is a relatively low digit and might be more believable. I'll bid 4 5s to try to increase the digit without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, which is a relatively high quantity. Given my hand contains a 9, I can safely increase the quantity to 5, making a valid higher bid. I won't challenge since I have a digit that matches the current bid.

Player 1 bids: 5 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s. The current bid is 5 9s, implying there are at least three more 9s in the opponent's hand. Given there are only 16 digits total, having 5 or more 9s is quite unlikely, especially since I hold two already. The probability that the opponent has three or more 9s is low. Therefore, challenging is the best strategic move.
