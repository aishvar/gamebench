Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, meaning this is the first bid. I have one 0, one 1, two 2s, one 5, one 7, one 8 and one 9 in my hand. I should make a conservative bid to start. Bidding 1 0s seems reasonable as it's a low digit and I have one myself. It's a safe opening bid.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 1 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is only 1 0s and I alone have one, it's very likely there is at least one zero between both hands, so challenging now is unwise. A minimal safe raise is to increase the digit at the same quantity. I also have two 8s, so bidding 1 8s is safe, but it's not a valid raise over 1 0s because the digit is higher but quantity is the same, which is allowed. Alternatively, I can bid 1 9s, but I don't have any 9s. Since I have two 8s, I can confidently bid 2 8s, which is a strictly higher quantity and a common early bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 3 8s would be risky as it relies on the opponent having at least one 8 as well. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable increase in digit, and I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 3 0s is also possible, but 9s feel safer given the previous bid on 8s. Therefore, I will bid 3 9s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (87086246), I have two 8s and zero 9s. The current bid is 3 9s. Since I have no 9s, for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least three 9s in their eight digits, which is statistically unlikely. Given the improbability of the opponent holding three or more 9s, challenging the bid is the best strategic move.
