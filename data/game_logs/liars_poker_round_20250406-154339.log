--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game, so I want to start with a conservative but reasonable opening. My hand contains one 3, one 4, one 6, one 8, two 7s, one 5, and one 1. A safe and typical opening bid is 2 of a digit I hold, since on average there are about 1.6 of any digit across both hands. I have two 7s, so bidding 2 7s is a solid opening bid backed by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand contains a 7 and I know there are 8 digits in total for each player, I have a total of 16 digits in play. The current bid is low, so I should consider the possibility of having a higher quantity or digit. I have a 7 in my hand, and Player 0 might have a 7 as well. I will bid 3 7s to increase the quantity while staying with a reasonable digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '34687531', I have exactly one 7. The current bid is 3 7s, so for that to be valid, the opponent would need at least two 7s. While that's possible, it's somewhat unlikely given the distribution. Since I only have one 7, calling a challenge here puts pressure on the opponent's claim, which may be an overbid.
