Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have the digits 7, 6, 1, 7, 0, 5, 4, 6 in my hand, I can start with a conservative bid based on the most frequent digit in my hand, which is 6 (appears twice). Starting with a bid of 2 6s is a safe initial move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 23094992, containing digits 2, 3, 0, 9, 4, 9, 9, and 2. I have no 6s. The opponent's bid is '2 6s', meaning they believe there are at least two 6s among both hands. With none in my hand, the opponent would need to have at least two 6s themselves. Given that each player has 8 digits, it is plausible but not guaranteed. However, since the bid is relatively low and plausible, challenging seems risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid that aligns with digits I have multiple copies of. I have three 9s in my hand, making a bid of '3 9s' reasonable and safe.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand (76170546). The current bid is 3 9s, which seems unlikely given that I have none. The probability that the opponent has at least three 9s is low, so challenging is the best move.
