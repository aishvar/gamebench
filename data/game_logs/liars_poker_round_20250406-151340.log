Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 53207307. I see that I have one 7 and one 3. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative and based on my hand. Since I have two digits that appear once, I can start by bidding on one of them. Bidding '2 7s' seems like a good start as it is a low quantity and I have one 7 in my hand.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s (digits: 6,8,4,0,4,6,5,7). Since the current bid is 2 7s and I already hold two, it's quite likely that there are more 7s in total, or at least that the bid is safe. Therefore, challenging now would be risky. The minimal safe move is to increase the bid to 2 8s, which is a strictly higher bid, but since I only have one 8, a safer approach is to increase the quantity to 3 of a digit I have multiples of. I have two 6s, so bidding 3 6s seems reasonable, as it likely includes at least one on the opponent's side.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 7 and no 6s in my hand. The bid history shows that Player 1 increased the quantity and decreased the digit from 2 7s to 3 6s. I need to make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have no 6s, I think 3 6s might be a relatively safe bid for Player 1, so I'll increase the digit. Bidding 3 7s is a valid move and seems reasonable given my hand has a 7.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s (digits: 68404657). The current bid is 3 7s. Since I already hold two 7s, for the bid to be valid, my opponent only needs to have at least one 7, which is quite plausible given 8 unknown digits. Therefore, challenging now is risky. A safe and strategic move is to increase the bid slightly. I will raise to 3 8s, as it's a minimal increase in digit while keeping the quantity the same, applying pressure without overcommitting.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 7 and no 8s in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I don't have any 8s, bidding 3 9s seems reasonable as it increases the digit. However, I should also consider the likelihood of the other player having a high count of 8s or 9s. Given the information, bidding 3 9s is a relatively safe move as it challenges the current bid without being too aggressive.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 68404657, I have no 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, which requires there to be at least three 9s across both hands. Since I have zero, the opponent would need all three or more, which is quite unlikely. Given the previous bids, the opponent may be pushing the digit upward without strong evidence. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
