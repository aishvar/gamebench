Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I have the opportunity to start the bidding. My hand contains the digits 1, 4, 3, 5, 4, 8, 1, which gives me a significant number of 1s and 4s. A reasonable opening bid would be for a digit that I have a decent count of. I will bid '1' for the digit '4', as I have two 4s in my hand, and this is a strong starting position.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 four. I have no fours in my hand. It's likely the opponent does not have many fours either. Bidding '2 4s' is reasonable as it's a small increase, and if the opponent has no fours, they might challenge. A larger bid could be risky. I'm aiming to test the waters without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand (17435481), which means the current bid of 2 4s is valid based on my own cards. However, since Player 1 has made this bid, I need to consider if they are bluffing or if they genuinely have at least two 4s. Given that I have seen no other bids indicating a higher count for 4s and I have the same count, I can either challenge or raise. Raising would mean I need to bid at least 3 4s, which is possible but risky, as I am unsure of Player 1's hand. Therefore, I will challenge the current bid, as I suspect Player 1 may be bluffing.
