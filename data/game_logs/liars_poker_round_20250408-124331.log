Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one '0', so the bid of '1 0s' is already met by my own hand. With 16 total digits in play, it's highly likely that there are additional zeros. Therefore, increasing the bid slightly to '2 0s' is safe and reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. Checking my hand (16093358), I have one '1'. Given that Player 0 bid 2 1s, it's plausible they have at least one '1' themselves. Therefore, challenging seems risky. Instead, I should raise the bid cautiously. I have two '3's in my hand, making a bid of 2 3s a safe and reasonable increment, maintaining the same quantity but increasing the digit.
