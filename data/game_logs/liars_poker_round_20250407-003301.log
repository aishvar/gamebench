Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (35109417), I see that I have two 1s. Bidding 2 1s is the most conservative and safe starting bid, as it's the lowest possible valid bid and I know for sure that there are at least two 1s in play.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. In my hand, I have no 1s, which makes it less likely that there are many 1s in total. However, challenging at this early stage is risky since 2 1s is a low bid, and Player 0 may have at least two 1s in their hand. To avoid challenging too soon, I will make a higher bid. I have three 0s in my hand, so bidding 3 0s is reasonable and increases the quantity while shifting the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s, which is higher than the number of 0s I have. However, I have two 1s, and the previous bid was 2 1s. To make a valid higher bid, I can increase the quantity of 1s to 4, which is a reasonable assumption given the previous bid and my hand. This bid increases both quantity and digit compared to the current bid of 3 0s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have no 1s in my hand, which makes it less likely that there are at least 4 in total across both hands. However, it is still plausible given the maximum of 16 digits in play. To maintain the game, I will increase the bid by switching to a slightly higher quantity of a digit I have more of. I have two 0s in my hand, so bidding 5 0s is a reasonable move to increase the quantity while staying within plausible bounds.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, and the current bid is 5 0s. Given the bid history, Player 1 has been increasing the bid on 0s, suggesting they might have multiple 0s. However, with only one 0 in my hand, the total possible 0s in play (considering both hands) is at most 2 (mine) + 8 (theoretical maximum in Player 1's hand) = 10. Bidding 6 0s is risky, as it requires at least 6 0s in total, which seems unlikely. Instead, I should challenge the current bid to verify its validity.
