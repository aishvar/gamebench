Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand 79524245, I have three 4s and two 2s. The most common digit in my hand is 4. A conservative but reasonable opening bid would be 3 4s, as I already hold three of them, making it likely there are more in total.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I do not have any 4s in my hand, which makes it possible that the actual count is low. Challenging this bid could reveal if the count is less than 3, allowing me to win if that's the case.
