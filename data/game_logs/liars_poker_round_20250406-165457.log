Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. I have two 1s, two 2s, two 3s, one 9. A conservative approach is to bid 1 of the digit I have the most of. I'll bid 1 1s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 1s. I have a 1 in my hand. I can safely bid a higher quantity of 1s, as I am certain of at least one 1.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have three 1s in my hand. I can safely bid higher by increasing the quantity. Bidding 3 1s is a logical next step, as it's a valid increase and I have the cards to support it. I'm avoiding bidding a higher digit as I don't have strong holdings of other digits.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 1S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. With my hand, I have one 1. I can safely increase the quantity to 4 1s, as it's a reasonable assumption with only 16 total digits in play.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have three 1s in my hand. Bidding 5 1s is a reasonable increase in quantity. It's likely there are at least five 1s total given my hand and the previous bids.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 1S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 5 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Bidding 6 1s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 1S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have three 1s in my hand. Bidding 7 1s is a reasonable increase, as it is a higher quantity than the current bid and based on the number of 1s I hold. It's not overly aggressive, but it's a logical progression from the previous bids.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 1S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 7 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. Considering the bid history, it seems likely that a higher quantity or digit is needed to win. I have a 7 in my hand, so I can safely bid a higher quantity or digit without risking an unlikely challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 1S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 8 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s. I have three 1s in my hand. It's likely my opponent also has some 1s, but 8 seems high. However, given the history of escalating bids, simply challenging might be too risky. I can bid 9 1s, which is a small increase in quantity, and see if the opponent challenges. This allows me to gather more information without immediately risking a challenge myself. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit, but 1s have been the focus of the bidding so far, and I have three of them. Bidding on a different digit would be less informed.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 1S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 9 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 1s. I have 1 one in my hand. I can try to bid a higher quantity or digit. Since I have a 1, I can bid a higher quantity of 1s. The next possible digit is 2, but I don't have it in my hand, so I'll stick with a higher quantity of 1s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 1S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 10 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 1s. I have four 1s in my hand. It's possible there are 10 or more 1s total, but it's becoming increasingly unlikely as the bid increases. The previous bids show a clear pattern of escalation. Given the high quantity already bid, and that I only have four 1s, I believe challenging is the best course of action. It's a risky challenge, but continuing to bid would likely result in overbidding and losing.
