Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have the digits 3, 9, 7, 3, 2, 8, 0, and 6. I notice I have two 3s, which is the highest count of any single digit in my hand. Opening with '2 3s' is a strong and safe starting bid, reflecting my hand while not being overly aggressive.
