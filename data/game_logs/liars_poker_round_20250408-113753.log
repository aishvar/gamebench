Player 0 Reasoning: I have a good mix of digits in my hand. I'll start by bidding on a digit that's likely to be high, given the random distribution of digits. I notice I have a 9 in my hand, so I'll bid on that.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s. Since I have two 9s, it is likely that the other player has at least one 9. Bidding 3 9s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s. Since I have two 9s, it's likely that there are at least 5 9s in total (considering the other player's hand). Bidding 5 9s is a reasonable move, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. It's plausible that the other player has at least 4 9s. Bidding 7 9s is a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity of the current digit. Challenging seems risky since the bid is not extremely high.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Given the bidding history, it seems likely that there are at least 8 9s in total. Bidding higher on 9s is risky. However, I can challenge the bid because it's possible that the opponent is bluffing, especially since the bids have been incrementing steadily. If I challenge and lose, I might be at a disadvantage, but if I win, I gain a significant advantage.
