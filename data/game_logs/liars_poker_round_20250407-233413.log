Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid of 2 3s is safe because even if the opponent has no 3s, the total count (2) meets the bid. This also sets a higher digit (3) as the baseline, making it harder for the opponent to bid a higher digit without increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I hold one '3' (24113485), meaning the bid is true if the opponent has at least one '3' among their 8 digits, which is statistically likely. Therefore, challenging seems risky. I need to make a higher bid. I have two '1's and two '4's. Bidding '2 4s' is a safe option as it's guaranteed true based on my hand, but it's a low bid. Bidding '3 1s' is also a strong option. It's higher than '2 3s' (quantity increase) and requires only one '1' from the opponent's 8 digits to be true, which is probable given I hold two '1's. This leverages my hand composition reasonably.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 1s in my hand. The current bid is 3 1s, meaning the opponent must have all three. With only 8 unknown digits, the probability of them holding â‰¥3 1s is low (~4% by binomial distribution). Challenging has a high success chance.
