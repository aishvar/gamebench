Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 50562779, which contains two 7s and one 5 and other digits. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. I have a total of 8 digits, and I see two 7s, so bidding on 7s seems like a good start. I'll bid 3 7s as it's a moderate quantity and I'm somewhat confident in my hand having seen two 7s.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, which makes the current bid of 3 7s somewhat risky for my opponent. Since there are 8 unknown digits, the probability they contain 3 or more 7s is low but plausible. However, making a minimal raise is safer than challenging now, as 3 7s is not outrageous. I can raise to 3 8s, which is a strictly higher bid with minimal risk increase, keeping the pressure on my opponent.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 7 and no 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s is a valid move as it increases the digit. It's also a relatively safe bid considering the quantity is the same as the previous bid, and I'm not committing to a higher count than the current bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. For the current bid of 3 9s to be valid, my opponent must have at least two 9s, which is plausible but not guaranteed. Since raising to 4 9s would be risky given I only hold one, I can instead increase the digit to 3 0s, which is not a legal move since it's a lower digit. To outbid, I can bid 4 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s and two 1s, but no digit with more than two occurrences. Statistically, a bid of 4 1s is reasonable because combining my two 1s with the opponent's potential 1s makes it plausible. Therefore, I will raise to 4 1s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand (50562779), so there are 7 more digits left for my opponent. The probability of my opponent having more than 3 ones is relatively low. However, I can still make a higher bid. I see that my hand contains a 7 and a 9. The previous bids were 3 7s and 3 9s. I can bid 4 7s or 4 9s to increase the quantity while keeping the digit the same or higher. Since I have a 7 and a 9, and the last bid was 3 9s, I will bid 4 9s to maintain a higher digit and increase the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 48326194, which contains two 9s. The current bid is 4 9s, so for that bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least two 9s as well. Given the distribution, it's unlikely the opponent has two or more 9s, making a total of four or more. Since 9 is a high digit and players tend to overbid on high digits, I believe the current bid is risky. Therefore, the best move is to challenge.
