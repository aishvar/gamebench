Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I don't have any 2s in my hand. Bidding 5 2s seems risky. I could bid 4 3s, which is a safe increase. However, I have two 9s in my hand, and the previous bid was 2 9s. Since the bidding has been relatively low, I will bid 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, and increasing the quantity might be a good strategy.
