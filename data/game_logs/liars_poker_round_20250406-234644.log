Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. As the first bidder, starting with 3 7s balances risk and aggression. This requires the opponent to have at least one 7 (total â‰¥3) while leveraging my existing pair. It sets a moderate baseline without overcommitting.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 7s' and my hand '80233549', I notice I don't have any 7s. However, to make a bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have enough information to safely challenge the bid and considering my hand doesn't contain any 7s, I should look for a digit that appears frequently enough to make a reasonable bid. My hand contains two 3s and other digits that appear once. Bidding on a digit I have more of, like the 3, but increasing the quantity to make it higher than the current bid isn't feasible since my hand doesn't support a high enough quantity for any digit to confidently bid higher without risking a challenge. However, considering the nature of Liar's Poker, I must make a move that either challenges the current bid or makes a new bid. Given the current bid is '3 7s', and without having 7s in my hand, challenging seems like a viable option because the bid seems somewhat high for a digit I don't have, but I must consider if it's plausible for the other player to have enough 7s to make this bid valid. Since I don't have enough 7s to contribute to the total and the bid is already at '3 7s', challenging this bid might be risky if the other player indeed has a couple of 7s. Thus, I need to decide based on the likelihood of the other player's hand containing enough 7s to fulfill the bid. Given the lack of information about the other player's hand and the fact that my hand doesn't contain any 7s, making a bid on a different digit that I have more of, or challenging, are my options. Considering these factors, challenging might not be the best move without more confidence that the bid is incorrect. Looking at my hand again, I see that I have two 3s, which could be a basis for a bid, but the quantity would need to be higher than 3 to outbid '3 7s'. Since my hand doesn't support a higher quantity bid on any digit confidently, and considering the rules that allow bidding on any digit, I must weigh the risk of challenging versus the risk of being challenged on a new bid. Given these considerations and the need to make a strategic decision, bidding higher on a digit I can somewhat support or challenging are my main considerations.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 3s in my hand, meaning all 4 claimed 3s would need to come from the opponent's 8-card hand. Having exactly four 3s in an 8-card hand is possible but statistically unlikely. Challenging this bid carries reasonable risk given the high concentration required.
