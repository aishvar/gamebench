Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 1s, two 3s, one 4, one 6, and one 9. A conservative and safe opening bid is '2 1s' because I have two 1s myself, making the bid credible and forcing the opponent to either raise or challenge with minimal risk.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 90401613, I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 9, and two 0s (since there is a 0 and another 0). Actually, correcting: digits are 9,0,4,0,1,6,1,3. Counting 2s, I have zero 2s. The current bid is 2 2s, so for that bid to be true, the opponent must have at least two 2s. Since I have none, and it's unlikely the opponent has both, challenging seems reasonable. However, since 2 is a low bid and the opponent might have two 2s, it's risky. Instead, I can safely increase the bid by quantity or digit. I have two 0s, so bidding 3 0s is plausible, assuming the opponent may have one 0. This is a minimal safe raise.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 90401613, I count two 1s and two 0s. The current bid is 3 1s. Since I already hold two 1s, it's quite plausible my opponent has at least one more 1, making the current bid reasonable. To raise, I can either increase the digit at the same quantity (bid 3 2s or higher) or increase the quantity. I don't have many 2s (none), so a safer incremental bid is 3 3s, as I have one 3 in hand, or 4 0s, given I have two 0s, but four 0s is less likely without more info. Incrementing to 3 3s is the minimal safe bid that's strictly higher, and keeps pressure on opponent.
