Okay, let's see. The game is Liar's Poker, and I need to decide my first move. The current bid is None, so I have to make the first bid. Let me start by analyzing my hand. My hand is 93170126. Let me list out the digits here: 9, 3, 1, 7, 0, 1, 2, 6. Let me count how many of each digit I have.

Looking at each digit:
- 0: 1
- 1: 2
- 2: 1
- 3: 1
- 6: 1
- 7: 1
- 9: 1

So, in my hand, the digit 1 appears twice, and the others appear once each. But the total digits in play are 16 (since each player has 8). Since the opponent's hand is unknown, I have to estimate the possible counts.

Since the first bid has to be at least 1 of any digit. But the strategy here is to make a bid that's likely to be true but not too high, so that the opponent might have to challenge or raise. Alternatively, maybe start with a lower bid to not give away too much information.

Looking at my hand, the highest count I have is 2 of 1s. But the total possible 1s could be up to 2 (mine) plus whatever the opponent has. If I bid 3 1s, that would mean I think there are at least 3 in total. But since I have 2, the opponent needs to have at least 1. That's possible. But maybe starting with 2 1s is safer. Wait, but the bid must be higher than the current bid, which is None. So any valid bid is allowed here. The minimum bid is 1 of any digit.

But starting with a higher quantity might be better. Let's think. If I bid 2 1s, that's a low risk because I already have 2. The opponent might not have any, but if they challenge, they would lose. Alternatively, maybe bid 3 1s. If I have 2, the opponent needs to have at least 1. If they have none, then the total is 2, and I would lose if challenged. But since the opponent doesn't know my hand, they might not challenge immediately.

Alternatively, maybe bid a digit that I have one of, but higher. For example, 2 9s. I have one 9. If I bid 2 9s, the opponent might have one, making it 2. But if they don't, then it's risky. Alternatively, maybe start with a lower digit. Let's see.

Another approach: the total digits are 16. The average per digit is 1.6, but some digits might be more common. Since the opponent's hand is random, maybe certain digits are more probable. But without knowing their hand, it's hard.

Alternatively, maybe bid a digit that's not in my hand. For example, 4s. If I bid 1 4s, that's possible. But since I don't have any, the opponent might have one. But if they don't, the total is zero. But that's a risky first bid.

Wait, but the first bid can be as low as 1. So the safest first bid is to pick a digit I have at least one of, and bid 1. But that might not be optimal. Alternatively, since I have two 1s, maybe bid 3 1s. Let's think: if I have two, the opponent needs to have at least one. The chance that they have at least one 1 in their 8 digits. Let's calculate the probability. But maybe that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the opponent's hand has 8 digits. The total number of 1s in the deck is 4 (since each digit appears 4 times in a standard deck, but wait, in Liar's Poker, how many of each digit are there? Wait, the problem statement says "Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits." So total 16 digits. But how are the digits distributed? Are they from 0-9, each possibly multiple times? Wait, the standard Liar's Poker uses a deck where each digit 0-9 appears 4 times, making 40 cards. But here, the problem says each player has 8 digits. Wait, maybe in this version, each player has 8 digits, possibly with duplicates. Wait, the initial problem statement says "Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits." So total 16 digits. But how many of each digit are there? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps each digit can appear multiple times. But maybe the setup is that each digit 0-9 can be present in any quantity across the 16 digits. So for example, maybe there are 3 of a particular digit, or 5, etc. So the maximum possible for any digit is 16, but that's only if all 16 digits are the same, which is impossible. Wait, the problem says "the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16", but that's probably a mistake. Because each player has 8 digits, so total 16. So the maximum possible for a digit is 16, but that's only if all 16 digits are the same, which is not possible in a real game. But maybe in this problem's context, digits can be duplicated. Wait, perhaps the initial deal is that each player gets 8 digits, which can have duplicates. So for example, maybe the deck has multiple copies of each digit, but the exact distribution isn't specified. So in this scenario, the total count of each digit is unknown, but the sum is 16.

Given that, the player's hand is 93170126. So in their own hand, they have two 1s, and one each of 9,3,7,0,2,6. So the other player's hand has 8 digits. The total for each digit is sum of both players' hands.

So when making the first bid, the player needs to estimate the total. Since there's no prior bid, the first bid can be any quantity and digit, as long as it's valid (quantity at least 1, digit 0-9).

The goal is to make a bid that is likely to be true, but also puts pressure on the opponent. Alternatively, make a conservative bid to not risk being challenged immediately.

In the first move, since there's no prior bid, the player can start with a low quantity. But starting too low might give the opponent an easy raise. For example, if I bid 1 0s, and I have one 0, the opponent could raise to 2 0s if they have one, or challenge if they don't. But since the opponent's hand is unknown, it's risky.

Alternatively, since I have two 1s, maybe bid 2 1s. That's a safe bet because I already have two. The total would be at least 2, so the bid is valid. Then the opponent has to either raise or challenge. If they challenge, they lose because the total is at least 2. But maybe the opponent would raise. For example, they might bid 3 1s if they have one. But if they don't have any 1s, they might challenge. However, since the bid is 2 1s, and I have two, the total is exactly 2 if the opponent has none. So if the opponent challenges, they would win because the total is 2, which is equal to the bid. Wait, the rules say: "If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins." So if the bid is 2 1s, and the total is exactly 2, the bidder wins. So in that case, if I bid 2 1s, and the opponent challenges, they would lose if the total is 2 or more. But if the opponent has zero 1s, the total is 2, so the bidder (me) wins. Therefore, bidding 2 1s is a safe first bid because even if the opponent challenges, they would lose. Therefore, the opponent is unlikely to challenge, and instead may choose to raise.

Alternatively, maybe bid higher. For example, 3 1s. If I have two, the opponent needs to have at least one. If they have none, the total is 2, so the bid would be invalid. But if I bid 3 1s, the opponent might challenge if they don't have any. So that's risky. But if the opponent does have a 1, then the total is 3, and the bid is valid.

Alternatively, maybe start with a different digit. For example, 2 9s. I have one 9. If the opponent has one, the total is 2. So the bid is valid. But if they have none, the total is 1, and the bid would be invalid. So that's a 50-50 chance. But since the opponent's hand is unknown, it's risky.

Alternatively, maybe bid 2 of a digit that I have one of, but the digit is high. For example, 2 7s. I have one 7. If the opponent has one, total is 2. But if they don't, the bid is invalid. So again, risky.

Alternatively, maybe bid 1 of a high digit. For example, 1 9s. That's definitely valid, since I have one. But the opponent can easily raise to 1 of a higher digit, like 1 9s can be raised to 1 9s (same quantity, higher digit?), wait no. The rules say a higher bid is either higher quantity or same quantity but higher digit. So if I bid 1 9s, the opponent can bid 1 9s again? No, wait, the bid must be strictly higher. So if I bid 1 9s, the opponent can bid 2 9s (higher quantity) or 1 of a higher digit, but 9 is the highest digit. So they can't raise the digit. So they would have to bid 2 9s. But if they don't have any 9s, they might challenge. But since I have one, the total is at least 1, so the bid is valid. So the opponent can't challenge successfully. So bidding 1 9s is safe, but it's a very low bid, giving the opponent an easy raise.

So considering all this, the safest first bid is probably 2 1s. Because I have two, so the total is at least 2, making the bid valid. The opponent can't challenge successfully. They would have to raise. So that's a good starting point. Alternatively, maybe 3 1s to be more aggressive, but that's riskier.

Alternatively, maybe look for a digit that I have one of, but the total could be higher. For example, 0s. I have one 0. If the opponent has two, the total is three. But I don't know. So bidding 2 0s would be risky.

Alternatively, maybe 2 6s. I have one 6. If the opponent has one, total is two. So bid 2 6s. But again, if they have none, the bid is invalid.

So, given the options, the safest first bid is 2 1s. Because I can be certain that the total is at least 2, so the bid is valid, and the opponent can't challenge. They have to raise. So that's a good starting point.

Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids yet. My hand is 9, 3, 1, 7, 0, 1, 2, 6. I need to make the first bid. Since there's no existing bid, I can start with the lowest possible quantity. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s. To play cautiously, I can bid 2 1s, which is a safe starting point based on my visible cards.

Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 1s, which makes it unlikely that there are at least 2 1s across all 16 digits. Since the bid is low and I cannot confidently make a higher bid based on my hand, the best move is to challenge the bid and test its validity.
