Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first turn, so I need to make the opening bid. In my hand, I have two 0s, two 9s, one 1, one 3, one 4, and one 8. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be 2 9s, as I already have two 9s in my hand, and it's likely there are more in my opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (45325847), I don't have any 9s. The current bid is 2 9s, which means the opponent is claiming there are at least 2 nines between our hands. Since I have zero 9s, this means all claimed 9s would have to be in the opponent's hand. With 8 digits per player, it's certainly possible they have 2 or more 9s. I could challenge, but it's a reasonable opening bid that could easily be true. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I notice I have two 5s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 5s. I'll bid 3 5s, which is higher than 2 9s because I'm increasing the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, so the current bid of 3 5s relies entirely on Player 1's hand. This makes it somewhat plausible, but I cannot confirm it. However, I have three 9s in my hand, which makes bidding 4 9s a strong and reasonable move as it increases both the quantity and the digit, leveraging my hand's strength.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (45325847), I don't have any 9s. The current bid is 4 9s, which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 4 nines between our hands. Since I have zero 9s in my hand, this would mean Player 0 would need to have at least 4 nines in their hand of 8 digits. While possible, having 4 of the same digit in an 8-digit hand is somewhat unlikely (about 1.4% chance if digits were randomly distributed). Given I have no 9s to contribute to the count, I think challenging is the better option here rather than making a higher bid that would be even more difficult to achieve.
