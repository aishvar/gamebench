Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand (59244866), I have: one 5, one 9, two 4s, one 2, two 6s, and one 8. Since I have two 4s and two 6s, these are my strongest digits. I'll start with a moderate bid on 6s since I have two of them. A bid of '3 6s' means I'm claiming there are at least 3 sixes total between both players' hands. Since I already have 2 sixes, I only need the other player to have 1 more six for this to be true, which is reasonable. Starting with a moderate bid gives me room to maneuver later.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, making the current bid of 3 6s questionable. Challenging is a viable option as the opponent might be bluffing, especially since this is their first bid. Without any 6s, if the total is less than 3, I win. The risk is manageable given the uncertainty.
