Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: For my opening bid, I should analyze my hand and make a strategic initial bid. I have one '3' in my hand, which means there could be up to 9 more '3's in the opponent's hand. A conservative opening bid would be to claim 3 threes (3 3s), which is likely to exist given I already have one and only need 2 more from my opponent's 8 digits. This is a safe opening bid that doesn't reveal too much information about my hand while still being likely true.
