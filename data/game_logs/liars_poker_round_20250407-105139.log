Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 1 0s, which is quite low and easily believable. Since I hold one 0 myself, it's very likely that there could be at least one more 0 in the opponent's hand, making a higher bid reasonable. The minimal strictly higher bid would be 1 1s, but since I also have two 5s and two 5s in my hand, raising the quantity on 5s could be strategic. Therefore, I will bid 2 5s, increasing the quantity and focusing on a digit I have strong evidence for.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '20595357', I have zero 6s, so the current bid of 2 6s relies entirely on Player 0 having both 6s, which is possible but not guaranteed. However, since 2 is a low quantity and quite plausible across 16 digits, challenging now carries significant risk. Instead, I can safely raise the bid to 2 7s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have two 7s in my hand, making this a strong and safe bid.
