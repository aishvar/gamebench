Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Bidding 3 2s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely there are at least three 2s across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I checked my hand (40780961) and noticed I have no 2s. Since the current bid is '3 2s', this count must come solely from the opponent's 8 hidden digits. Statistically, the chance that 8 random digits contain three or more 2s is very low (around 3.8%). This makes the current bid highly unlikely to be true, so challenging it is the best move.
