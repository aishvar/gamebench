Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 4s, two 7s, one 6, and one 2. It's generally safe to open with a conservative bid based on my own hand. I will bid 2 5s, reflecting the two 5s I have, which is a reasonable opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s, so there must be at least one more 6 in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. This is quite plausible. I don't have enough evidence to challenge now. A safe and natural next bid is to increase the quantity to 3 while keeping the digit at 6, which is a minimal raise and keeps pressure on the opponent.
