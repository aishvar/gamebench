Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. Since there's no current bid, I can start by bidding on a digit I have. Bidding 2 5s is a safe move because the total will be at least 2, making my bid valid regardless of the opponent's hand. This sets a moderate starting point and is less likely to provoke an immediate challenge.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current game state. Looking at my hand (76830910), I don't have any 5s. The current bid is 2 5s, which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 2 fives between both our hands. Since I have zero 5s, this means Player 0 must have at least 2 fives in their hand for this bid to be valid. This is certainly possible, so challenging might be risky. I should make a higher bid based on what I know about my hand. I have one 7, one 6, one 8, one 3, one 0, one 9, and one 1. My most frequent digit is actually a tie between all digits (one each), so I'll choose a digit and increase the quantity or value. I'll bid 2 6s, which is higher than 2 5s because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity. This is a safe bid since I already have one 6 in my hand, so I only need Player 0 to have one more 6 for this to be valid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, making the total count dependent on Player 1's hand. Challenging the bid of '2 6s' is a calculated risk, as it's possible Player 1 may have only one 6, resulting in a total count of one, which would make the challenge successful.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) challenges Player 1's (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bid of 2 6s.
