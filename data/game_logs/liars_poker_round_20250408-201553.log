Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, one 1, one 2, one 4, one 5, one 7, and one 9. The safest opening bid is typically the digit I have the most of. I have two 0s, so bidding 2 0s is a reasonable and conservative opening bid that reflects my hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one '1' (the digit '1' appears once). The current bid is 2 1s, which implies at least two '1's across both hands. Since I hold one, it's quite plausible the opponent holds at least one more, so challenging now is risky. To make a safe higher bid, I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, for example, bid 2 2s. Looking at my hand, I have two '0's and one '2'. Raising to 3 0s is risky since I only have two. But bidding 2 2s is a valid strictly higher bid and plausible given I have one '2'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s, one 1, one 2, one 4, one 5, one 7, and one 9. The current bid is 2 3s, and I have zero 3s. For Player 1's bid of 2 3s to be valid, they must have at least two 3s themselves or be bluffing. Since I have no 3s, and the total digits are 16, the probability that there are two or more 3s entirely in Player 1's hand is somewhat plausible but not highly likely. However, since the bid is relatively low and early in the game, it's safer strategically to raise the bid rather than challenge now. I can increase the quantity to 3 and pick a digit I have multiple of, such as 0s, which I have two. So, a reasonable next bid is 3 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 50712409, I have two 0s and one 1. The current bid is 3 1s. Since I only have one 1, for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need at least two 1s. While that's possible, it's not very probable. However, I have two 0s, and the previous bid was 3 0s, which I made, so I can raise the digit instead. To make a safe, valid higher bid, I can bid 3 2s, since I have one 2, and it's plausible the opponent has at least two more. This is a conservative and strategic increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, and one 3. The current bid is 3 3s, and since I have one 3, the opponent would need to have at least two more 3s for the bid to be valid. Given that each player has 8 digits, and the average count per digit is roughly 1.6, having three or more 3s total is plausible but somewhat unlikely. However, since it's close to the statistical average and not an extreme bid, it's safer to raise the bid slightly rather than challenge now. I also have two 0s, so increasing the quantity to 3 4s would not be valid, but bidding 3 4s is a minimal increase but riskier. Instead, I will increase to 3 4s, which is a safe incremental bid.
