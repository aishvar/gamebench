Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand. The current bid is None, so I need to make a valid higher bid. I can start by bidding a reasonable quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 3s (digits are 1,3,6,3,4,2,9,9), so only two 3s. For the current bid of 3 3s to be valid, the opponent must have at least one 3. This is quite plausible, so challenging now is risky. To continue the game strategically, I can make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving from 3 3s to 3 4s. I have one 4, so bidding 3 4s is reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s, made by Player 1. I have two 7s and one 5 in my hand. Given the current bid, I should make a bid that is higher in quantity or digit. Bidding 4 5s seems reasonable, as it increases the quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 0 bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 1, 3, 6, 3, 4, 2, 9, 9. There are zero 5s in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s. Since I have none, for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need to have all 4 or more 5s, which is quite unlikely given random distribution and the fact that only 8 digits remain hidden. Expecting 4 or more 5s in just 8 digits is improbable. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
