Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 4s, two 0s, one 2, one 7, and one 1. The most common digits in my hand are 0, 3, and 4, each appearing twice. A safe opening bid typically targets a digit I hold multiple times. Given that, bidding 3 3s is a reasonable conservative opening bid, as across 16 total digits, it's quite likely there are at least three 3s.
