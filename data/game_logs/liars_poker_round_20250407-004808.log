Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Since it's the first bid, starting with a modest and safe bid makes sense. Bidding 2 6s is a solid opening based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 6s in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s, which means the opponent must have at least two 6s. Since I have none, it's possible they have two or more, but with only 8 digits in their hand, it's a risky bid. I could challenge, but since the bid is low, I might want to bid higher to see if they'll challenge me later. I'll bid 3 7s, increasing the quantity and digit based on my hand which has two 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 4 6s is a higher quantity and thus a valid bid. It's a strategic move to increase the pressure on the opponent.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 2s and two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s, which is higher than my 7s count. Since I don't have any 6s in my hand, it's unlikely that there are 4 6s in total across both hands. Challenging seems like the best move.
