Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 8s, one 4, one 5, one 0, and one 9. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 7s, as I personally hold two 7s, making it likely the total count is at least two or more.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 52234406, I have zero 7s. The opponent bid '2 7s', claiming there are at least 2 sevens total. Since I have none, this means all claimed 7s would have to be in their hand. While possible, I could make a safe higher bid based on what I see in my hand. I have two 4s, which allows me to confidently bid '2 8s', increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity. This is a conservative but strategic move that I know is possible to achieve just from my opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s. Since the current bid is 2 8s, and I alone hold two 8s, it's quite plausible that there are even more 8s between both hands. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or the digit. Raising the digit beyond 8 would mean bidding on 9s, but I only have one 9, making it riskier. Therefore, the safest valid higher bid is to increase the quantity of 8s to 3, which is reasonable given my two 8s and the likelihood that the opponent may have at least one more 8.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (52234406), I have zero 8s. The opponent has bid 3 8s, meaning they're claiming there are at least 3 eights total between our hands. Since I have none, this means they would need to have at least 3 eights in their hand alone. While possible, this seems unlikely as it would mean over 1/3 of their digits are 8s. Given this and my perfect knowledge of having zero 8s, challenging seems like the optimal move.
