Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 3 5s assumes there's at least one more 5 in the opponent's hand, which is plausible. Choosing 5 over 2 because the higher digit provides a stronger bid at the same quantity, maximizing strategic advantage.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Given my hand (19997143), I have multiple high digits but only one 5. I also see that bidding a higher quantity with a higher digit could be advantageous. The current bid is 3 5s, so I should consider increasing either the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 9s and one 5 isn't enough to make a significantly higher bid with 5s, I should consider a higher digit. I have two 6s and two 7s and one 8, but no more 5s to contribute. A reasonable bid could be to increase the digit and possibly the quantity if I think my hand supports it.

Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand has 0 6s, so the opponent must have at least 4 6s in their 8 digits. The probability of them having 4+ 6s is extremely low (statistically, getting 4+ of a specific digit in 8 random digits is nearly impossible). Challenging is likely to win.
