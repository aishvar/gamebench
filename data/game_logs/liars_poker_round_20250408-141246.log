--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open with an initial bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 0s, two 4s, one 3, and one 2. A conservative but reasonable opening bid would be 2 5s, reflecting my own hand and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s. Since the current bid is 2 6s, and I hold two of them myself, it's quite plausible there might be at least one more 6 in the opponent's hand, making a higher bid reasonable. The next minimal valid bid would be 3 6s, which is likely safe given my hand and the total digits in play.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (35065425), I have the digits: 3, 5, 0, 6, 5, 4, 2, 5. I have zero 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, which would require at least three 7s across both hands. Since I hold none, the opponent would need all three or more 7s in their hand of 8 digits. The probability of this is low, as having three or more of a specific digit in one hand is uncommon. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move.
