Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 2 9s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 9.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand, making it a strong foundation to bid higher. The current bid is 2 9s, and since I have no 9s, challenging is risky. Bidding 3 0s is a safer move as it's likely valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are three 0s in total. However, I have one 6 in my hand, and bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, so Player 0 would need three more to make the bid of 4 6s valid. Considering the uncertainty and the possibility of a bluff, challenging is the safer option.
