Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game. I have two 3s in my hand. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is to claim there are at least two 3s in total. Bidding 'BID: 2 3' seems appropriate to start with, as it's not overly aggressive and reflects the cards I hold.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. My opponent has 8 digits. The maximum possible count of 3s is 16. To call would require me to bid higher than 2 3s. I could bid 3 3s. However, I could also challenge. Since I only have one 3, it is possible that my opponent is bluffing. I will challenge.
