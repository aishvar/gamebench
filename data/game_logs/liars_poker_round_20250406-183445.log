Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand 39727017, I have two 7s and two 0s, which are my strongest counts. A safe opening bid is usually 2 of a digit I have multiples of. Therefore, I will open with 2 7s, reflecting my hand strength and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s. Bidding 1 8s is a valid higher bid because 8 is a higher digit than 7, even with a lower quantity. This is a minimal and reasonable increase.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 7s. Bidding 2 8s is a higher bid because 8 is a higher digit than 7. This move is strategic as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, making it more likely to be valid.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 39727017, I have no 8s at all. Since the current bid is 2 8s, that means Player 1 is claiming there are at least two 8s total. Given I have zero, Player 1 would need to have both 8s themselves. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely for one player to hold both 8s, but not implausible. Because of this, challenging now carries some risk. Alternatively, I can make a safe higher bid based on my hand. I have two 7s, so bidding 3 7s is reasonable, as there is a good chance that Player 1 has at least one 7, or I can pressure them into challenging me instead.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, making the current bid of 3 7s questionable. Given that I hold none, Player 0 must have all three. Considering the bid history and the possibility of bluffing, challenging is a reasonable move to test the validity of the bid.
