Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have one '2' in my hand. Bidding 2 2s is a safe starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one '2' as well, making the bid valid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 2 6s is a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit). Since I hold two 6s, the bid can be safely made even if the opponent has none.

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. It's unlikely that the other player has another 6, so challenging seems risky. However, I do have two 2s in my hand. Bidding 3 2s is a reasonable move, as it increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s is a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit). There's a reasonable chance the opponent has at least one 6, making the total count 3 or more. Challenging risks losing if they have two 2s (total 3), which is plausible given their bidding history.

Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are three 6s in total, considering the bid history and the digits in my hand. Challenging this bid seems like the best move.
