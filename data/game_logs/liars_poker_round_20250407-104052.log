Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0, so the current bid of 1 0s is definitely valid. Since I must raise, I can either increase the digit or the quantity. I also have two 8s, which makes bidding on 8s safer. A natural and safe raise would be to bid 2 8s, leveraging my strong holding in 8s and increasing the quantity over the current bid.
