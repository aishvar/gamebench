Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make a valid initial bid. I have the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 5 in my hand. I can confidently bid at least 1 of any digit. I will choose to bid 1 7s, which is a reasonable starting point.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 9, 4, 6, 3, 2, 2, 9, 1, which contains zero 7s. Since the current bid is only 1 7s, it's quite plausible that the opponent has at least one 7, so challenging now would likely lose. The safest move is to make a minimal higher bid. I observe I have two 9s, so bidding 2 9s is reasonable and strictly higher than 1 7s (higher quantity).

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 and one 5 in my hand, but no 9s. The current bid is 2 9s, which seems unlikely since I have no 9s. Since the maximum total digits is 16, I suspect there are not enough 9s to meet the current bid. I should challenge this bid.
