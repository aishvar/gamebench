Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have two 6s and two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable move as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid. This bid is likely to be higher than the actual count of 0s, making it a safe bet.
