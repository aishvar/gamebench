Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand 81503644, the digit counts are: 0(1), 1(1), 3(1), 4(2), 5(1), 6(1), 8(1). A common opening bid is '2 Xs' on a digit I have at least one of. I have two 4s, so starting with '2 4s' is a safe and reasonable opening bid, reflecting my hand strength and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have zero 4s in my hand (19207673). For the current bid to be true, the opponent must have at least two 4s. While possible, challenging feels risky early on. I should make a higher bid based on my hand. I have two 7s, which is my most frequent digit. Bidding on 7s is strong. A bid of '2 7s' would be higher than '2 4s' and is guaranteed true since I hold two 7s. However, a slightly more aggressive bid of '3 7s' is also plausible. It requires the opponent to have at least one 7, which is statistically likely (8 digits, 10 possibilities). This puts more pressure on the opponent than the extremely safe '2 7s'. Therefore, I will bid 3 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 81503644, I have zero 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, which means there must be at least three 7s among all 16 digits. Since I have none, that would require my opponent to have all three or more 7s in their hand, which is unlikely. Given typical digit distribution, the probability that they hold 3 or more 7s is low. Therefore, challenging now is strategically sound.
