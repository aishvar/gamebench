Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s and two 5s. A bid of 2 5s seems reasonable as it reflects the number of 5s I have and doesn't overestimate the total count.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have one 5 in my hand (8 digits: 85027819). The total count of 5s across both hands must be at least 2 (one from my hand and potentially one from the other player's hand). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I see one 5 and the other player might have one, bidding 3 5s seems reasonable. However, I can also consider bidding on a higher digit if I have a good count of it. I have 2 eights, so bidding 3 8s is a viable option as it increases both the quantity and the digit.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains two 6s and other digits, but no 8s. I can see if I increase the quantity or the digit, I must make sure it's valid. Since I have two 6s, bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit compared to the current bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (from 85027819). To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Increasing the quantity to 5 with the same digit (6) gives '5 6s'. However, considering my hand, I should assess the likelihood of the total count. Since I have one 6, there are 7 other digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand. The total count of 6s could be higher, but '5 6s' seems a bit aggressive. On the other hand, bidding on a higher digit (7, 8, or 9) with the quantity 4 is a viable option. '4 8s' is a valid bid because it's a higher digit than 6, and I have one 8 in my hand, making it somewhat reasonable. However, considering the quantity, the previous bid was '3 8s', so I should be cautious. Given these considerations, making a bid that is not too aggressive but still higher than '4 6s' is necessary. Bidding '4 7s' or '4 8s' are both options. Since I have an 8, '4 8s' seems reasonable as it is based on having seen one of the digit in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains 2 sixes, 1 seven, 1 five, 1 nine, 1 zero, 1 eight, 1 four, and 1 three. The maximum possible quantity for any digit across both players' hands is 16. Given that the current bid is 4 8s, I should consider if I can reasonably make a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent. Since I have two 6s and the current bid is 4 8s, I can try to bid higher with a digit I have. Bidding 5 6s seems reasonable as it's higher than 4 8s and I have two 6s in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have many 6s, increasing the quantity to 6 might be too high unless the other player has a lot of 6s. However, I can bid 5 7s as it is a higher bid than 5 6s. It's a relatively safe move given the bid history and my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I need to make a higher bid. Since my hand contains two 6s and the last bid I made was 5 6s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Given that I have two 6s and the bid needs to be strictly higher, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. The bid of 5 7s seems high but I have no 7s. My hand has two 6s, and I can try to bid higher with a different digit. Bidding 6 0s seems unreasonable as it's a low digit, but bidding 6 8s seems too high without knowing the distribution. A reasonable next bid could be increasing the quantity of a digit I have, like 6 6s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (85027819), which means there are at least 7 sixes in total since my opponent bid 6 6s. I need to either challenge or make a higher bid. A higher bid could be either increasing the quantity to 7 or keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit to 7 or higher. Since I have a 7 and an 8 in my hand, I know there are at least two 7s and at least one 8 in total. Bidding 6 7s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit and is based on the information I have about my hand and the previous bids.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains 2 sixes and 1 seven, but no 7s to contribute to the count. Given that the bid is 6 7s, I must assess if it's likely or not. Since I have no 7s, I will assume Player 1 has at least 6 7s for them to bid that. However, I do have a significant number of other digits. I will challenge because 6 7s seems unlikely given I only have 1 seven and no information about Player 1's hand.
