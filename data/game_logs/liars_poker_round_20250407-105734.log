Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a good mix of digits in my hand, with two 6s being the most notable. I should start with a bid based on my hand, increasing both quantity and digit to make a strong statement.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider my hand and the current bid. My hand contains the digits 0, 1, 1, 7, 0, 9, 4, and 9. I have two 6s and two 0s, but no other 6s. Given that the current bid is 4 6s and I only have two 6s in total across my hand and potentially Player 0's hand, I should consider if I can make a higher bid with a different digit. The current bid is 4 6s, so I need at least 5 [digit]s or a higher digit with the same quantity to make a valid bid. I have two 9s and two 0s, but no more 6s to add. A reasonable bid could be 5 0s or 5 9s since I have two of these digits.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 6 9s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. Given my hand (01170949), I have a total of 4 '9's. The bid of 6 9s seems high but possible since there are 16 digits in total and two players. I should consider if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is more suitable. Since I have 4 '9's and my goal is to make a higher bid or challenge, I should look at my digits and see if I can make a reasonable bid or if challenging is more likely to succeed.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. Since I have two 9s in my hand, I can bid 8 9s, increasing the quantity of the digit 9, which is the current highest bid digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 8 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 9s. Given that I have a 9 in my hand and the total count of 9s could potentially be high, I need to assess the likelihood of there being 8 or more 9s in total. Since there are 16 digits in total (8 from each player), and I have one 9, if the other player also has one 9, that would only account for 2 of the 9s. However, I do not have enough information to assume there are 8 or more 9s. My goal is to make a valid higher bid. I can see that bidding a higher quantity with a lower digit might be more feasible. I have a 9, and several other digits that could potentially be in the higher quantity range. A bid of 9 0s seems unlikely since there are only 16 digits total and 9 0s would be an extremely high count. I will increase the quantity and bid on a lower digit that I know exists in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 9 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 0s, which seems unlikely given the bid history and the fact that I have no 0s in my hand. I should challenge the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) challenges Player 1's (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bid of 9 0s.
