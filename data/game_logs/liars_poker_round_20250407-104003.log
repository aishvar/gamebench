--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. I could bid higher on the quantity of 1s, but that would be risky. I have two 0s and two 7s. I could bid 3 0s or 3 7s. Since the previous bids involved 0s, I'll bid 3 0s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. I can bid 3 2s, which is a slightly higher bid and doesn't rely on me having any of the bid digit. Alternatively, I could bid 4 0s, since the opponent has bid 3 0s previously, and I have two 0s in my hand. I will bid 4 0s as it seems more likely to be a valid bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I don't have any 1s in my hand. Player 0 seems to be bidding somewhat randomly, but 4 1s is not an unreasonable bid. I can raise the bid to 5 0s, as I have two 0s in my hand, and it's a relatively safe increase.
