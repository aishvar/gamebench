Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None. I have a mix of digits in my hand. I notice I have two 9s. A reasonable starting bid would be to claim at least one 9 exists, as I have two. However, to make a more impactful bid, I can claim a higher quantity or digit. I see I have a 5 as well, but it's not as strong as the 9. I'll make a bid of 2 9s, as it's a stronger claim than 1 9, and I have the cards to back it up.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have a 9 in my hand and a 0, so I can bid on the higher digit. Since I have a 9, I can confidently bid a higher quantity of 9s. I will bid 4 9s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 0s, made by Player 1. Given the bid history and my hand (95103979), I notice I have a relatively low count of 9s. However, the current bid is for 0s, and I have no 0s in my hand. Considering the current bid is low and I have no 0s, I should make a higher bid. I have 9s in my hand, so I can bid a higher quantity or digit. I choose to bid a higher quantity, as I have multiple digits in my hand that are not 0s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 11 0s, which seems unlikely given the bid history and the fact that I have no 0s in my hand. I have 9s in my hand, so bidding 12 9s seems reasonable as it's a higher quantity and digit based on my hand.
