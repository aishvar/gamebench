Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Starting the bid with 3 6s leverages the two 6s in my hand. A total of three 6s is plausible since there are 8 unseen digits in the opponent's hand. Choosing a higher digit (6 over 3) gives strategic flexibility for future bids.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I need to analyze my hand and the bid history. My hand contains the digits 5, 1, 2, 8, 7, 1, 4, 1. I have a total of 3 '1's, but no '6's. Given that the current bid is 3 6s and I do not have any 6s, I should consider challenging if I think the bid is unlikely or try to make a higher bid if I have sufficient information. Since I don't have any 6s, I think the bid of 3 6s is unlikely to be true, but I need to make a strategic decision based on my hand and possible higher bids.
