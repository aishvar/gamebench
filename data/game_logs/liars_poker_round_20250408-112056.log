Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I need to make the first bid. My hand has 3,2,9,2,5,4,2,1. The digits in my hand are 1,2,2,2,3,4,5,9. The most common digit in my hand is 2, which appears three times. Since there are two players with 8 digits each, the total digits are 16. If I bid 4 2s, considering my three 2s, the opponent might have at least one 2, making the total at least 4. This is a safe starting bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have zero 2s in my hand (70978650). For the bid to be true, the opponent must have at least four 2s in their 8-digit hand. This is statistically unlikely (requires half their digits to be 2s). Therefore, challenging the bid is the most strategically sound move.
