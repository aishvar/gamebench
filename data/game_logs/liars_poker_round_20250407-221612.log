Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 23164015, I notice that I have two 1s. Since the goal is to make a bid that is reasonable yet strategic, bidding on a digit I have the most of is a good starting point. However, to minimize risk, I should start with a lower quantity and a digit that is somewhat common but not too high, as higher digits are less likely to appear in large quantities. Given my hand and the fact that I have two 1s, a safe initial bid could be 2 1s, as it's a low-risk move that still engages the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 1s in my hand, which makes the current bid of 2 1s less likely. However, since there are 16 digits total, it's still plausible the opponent has two 1s. Rather than challenge a relatively low and plausible bid, I will raise conservatively. I have two 7s, so bidding 2 7s is a legal higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and supported by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have the hand 23164015, which contains no 7s. The current bid is 2 7s, and since I don't have any 7s, I must rely on the likelihood of Player 1 having at least two 7s or having one 7 and hoping I have one, which seems uncertain. Given that I have no 7s, challenging seems like a reasonable approach, as it puts the pressure back on Player 1's claim without requiring me to have knowledge of their hand.
