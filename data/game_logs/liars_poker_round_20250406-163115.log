Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can start with any valid bid. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 7.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '18906734', I have exactly one 7. The current bid is 3 7s, which would require at least two 7s in the opponent's hand to be valid. Since each player only has 8 digits, having three or more 7s total is somewhat unlikely, especially as I only have one. The probability that the opponent holds at least two 7s is low, making this a good opportunity to challenge the bid.
