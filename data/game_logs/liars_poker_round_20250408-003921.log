Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have one 5 in my hand. Given that there are 16 digits in total (8 from each player), bidding 1 5 seems reasonable and low-risk.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, and the current bid is 1 5s. Bidding 1 8s is a higher bid because 8 is a higher digit than 5, and I have at least one 8. This is a safe move as it's minimal and based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 8s. Given that my hand contains a 5 and a few other digits, but no 8s, I should consider the possibility of there being more 8s in Player 1's hand. However, bidding 1 8s was a low risk, and I have a higher digit and potentially more quantity in my hand. I will increase the bid slightly but reasonably, considering my hand and the low bid so far.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, making the current bid of 2 9s suspect. Challenging is a strategic move to test if Player 0 is bluffing, as the bid's validity hinges on them holding at least two 9s.
