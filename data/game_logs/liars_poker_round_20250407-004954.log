--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 7s and two 9s, which are the highest frequency digits in my hand. Bidding 4 7s seems reasonable as it maximizes both quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand has no 7s, so the opponent must have at least four 7s. The probability of having four or more 7s in their 8-digit hand is extremely low (under 1%), making this bid highly unlikely. Challenging is the optimal choice.
