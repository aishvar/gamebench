Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have two 8s, two 4s, one 7, one 3, and two 0s in my hand. A safe initial bid would be to bid on a digit I have multiple of. Bidding 2 8s is a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 8s, so all 8s would have to be in Player 0's hand for the bid of 2 8s to be valid. Given there are 8 digits per player, it's plausible Player 0 has two or more 8s, so challenging now is risky. To make a higher bid, I will look for a digit I have multiple of. I have two 9s, so bidding 2 9s (same quantity, higher digit) is a safe incremental raise.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s would be risky, as it relies entirely on my opponent having at least one 9. I have two 8s, and the previous bid was 2 8s, so I know there are at least two 8s. A safe bid would be to increase the quantity of 8s. However, given the previous bid of 2 9s, I suspect my opponent might be bluffing. Increasing the quantity to 3 8s is a reasonable bid, but challenging seems more strategic given my hand and the opponent's bid. The probability of there being two 9s is relatively low.
