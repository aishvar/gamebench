Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 5s, one 0, one 4, one 7, and one 9. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, as I hold two 5s myself, making it likely that there could be more or at least matching the count in total.
