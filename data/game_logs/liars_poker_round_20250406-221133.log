Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 1s, so I know for sure there are at least two 1s in play. This opening bid is safe and leaves room to escalate in later rounds.

Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 2, 0, 6, 9, 1, 2, 6, 6. I only have one '1'. The current bid is 2 1s, which is plausible since I have one and the opponent may have one as well. To increase the bid, I look for a digit where I have multiple copies. I have three 6s, so bidding 3 6s is a safe and strategically strong move that is strictly higher than 2 1s (higher quantity).

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, and the current bid of 3 6s means that all three would have to come from my opponent's 8 digitsâ€”a highly unlikely scenario given the probability of a 6 appearing is only 10%. Therefore, challenging the bid is the most strategic move.
