Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '1 0s', I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have two 0s in my hand, increasing the quantity seems reasonable. However, considering the opponent's strategy is Naive 50/50, they might not have made an overly aggressive bid. Given my hand contains two 0s, bidding '2 0s' seems like a safe increase in quantity without jumping too high, considering the total possible count of any digit across both hands is 16.
