Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, there is 1 zero ('0'). Since the current bid is 1 zero, and I know for sure there is at least 1, it's risky to challenge now. The safest strategic move is to make a minimal higher bid. I don't have any 9s, but I do have three 1s and two 2s, so bidding 1 1s or 1 2s is not valid as it's not higher. The next valid bid with the same quantity is 1 1s (higher digit), but that's not higher because 1 0s -> 1 1s is a valid increment. Therefore, I will bid 1 1s, which is strictly higher than 1 0s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 73017122, I have three 2s. The current bid is only 1 2s, so I know there are at least 3 2s in total. It is safe and strategic to increase the bid to 3 2s, which is a valid higher bid and well-supported by my hand.
