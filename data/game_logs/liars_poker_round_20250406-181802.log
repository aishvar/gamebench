Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 64627084, which contains two 6s and one 4. A reasonable starting bid could be based on the digits I have. Since I have two 6s, bidding '2 6s' seems like a safe and informed start, as it reflects the count of a digit I have.
