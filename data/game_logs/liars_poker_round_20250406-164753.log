Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a good chance of getting some high digits in my hand, but I should start with a conservative bid to get a feel for the game. I'll look at the digits I have and make a small bid with a high digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 4, 5, 0, 7, 2, 6, 7, 3. I have zero 9s. Since the current bid is only 2 9s, and I have none, for the bid to be true, the opponent must have at least two 9s. Given that on average each digit appears roughly 1.6 times (16 digits / 10 digits), two 9s is plausible, so challenging now is risky. A safe move is to increase the bid slightly. I notice I have two 7s, so a natural higher bid is 3 7s, which increases the quantity and is based on my strong holding.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 4 8s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on the current bid and my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 45072673, I have zero 8s. For the current bid of 4 8s to be valid, the opponent must have all 4 or more 8s in their hand, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. Since I have none, and 4 is a relatively high count for a single digit, the probability that there are at least 4 total 8s is low. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
