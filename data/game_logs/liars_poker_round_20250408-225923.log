--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I need to make the first bid. I have four 4s in my hand, which is the most frequent digit. Bidding 5 4s seems reasonable, as it increases both quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (05962311), I have no 4s, which makes the current bid of 5 4s suspicious. Since I have zero 4s, all 5 or more 4s would have to be in Player 0's hand. Given they only have 8 digits, it's unlikely they hold 5 or more 4s, and very unlikely they have all 5 needed to meet the bid. Therefore, the probability that there are at least 5 total 4s is low, making challenging the best move.
