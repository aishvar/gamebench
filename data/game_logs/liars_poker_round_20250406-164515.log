Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a good mix of digits in my hand, including 0, 3, 5, and 8. The current bid is None, so I should start by bidding a reasonable quantity and digit. I notice that 5 is a relatively common digit, so I'll bid 3 5s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (7,0,9,8,1,4,9,0), I have no 5s. Since there are 8 digits in the opponent's hand, for the bid of 3 5s to be valid, there must be at least 3 5s in Player 0's hand. The probability of this is quite low, as the expected count of any digit per hand is less than 1 (since each digit appears on average 1.6 times in 16 digits). Given I have zero 5s, the bid of 3 5s is unlikely to be true, so I should challenge.
