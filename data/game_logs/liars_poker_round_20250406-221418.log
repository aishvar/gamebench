--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 3s. I don't have any 3s in my hand, but I do have two 4s. By bidding '2 4s', I leverage my hand knowing that there are at least two 4s in play. This bid is strictly higher than 1 3s (quantity increased from 1 to 2) and is safe since my own hand guarantees the bid, forcing my opponent into a tougher position.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. Since there are 16 total digits, it's plausible that there are at least two 4s. I could bid higher, but I'll choose to bid a slightly higher digit with a quantity I feel is safer, given my hand. I have three 3s, so I will bid 3 3s.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 3s in my hand, and the current bid of 3 3s would require all three to come from the opponentâ€™s 8 unknown digits, which is extremely unlikely given the random distribution. Therefore, I believe the bid is overblown and I should challenge it.
