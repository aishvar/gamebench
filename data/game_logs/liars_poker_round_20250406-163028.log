Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 1s, two 0s, one 8, three 2s, and one 3. The most common digits are 2s (3 times) and 5s, 1s, 0s (2 times each). Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will bid 3 2s, as I already hold three myself, making it very likely to be true.

Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s. I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable move based on my hand.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, which means my opponent is claiming there are at least three 6s between both hands. Since I have zero, all three would have to be in Player 1's hand, which is somewhat unlikely but still possible. Instead of challenging now, I can safely increase the bid by choosing a digit I have good representation of. I have two 5s, so bidding 3 7s or 4 2s isn't safer. However, I also have two 2s, so raising to 4 2s is a reasonable, safe bid that increases the quantity, leveraging my known count of 2s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have two 6s in my hand, which suggests that there might be a reasonable number of 6s in total. Bidding 5 6s increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a valid and strategic move. Challenging seems risky since the opponent might have more 2s than I have 6s.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (55018321), I have zero 6s. The opponent's bid of 5 6s implies there are at least five 6s across both hands. Since I hold none, all five (or more) would have to be in the opponent's hand of 8 digits, which is highly improbable. The expected count of any digit per 8-digit hand is less than one, so five 6s in one hand is extremely unlikely. Therefore, the opponent is probably bluffing or overbidding, making a challenge the best move.
