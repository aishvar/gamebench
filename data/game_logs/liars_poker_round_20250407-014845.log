Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 2 7s is a safe move as it's based on my known cards and sets a moderate starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have the hand 34396169, which contains one 9, two 6s, one 3, one 4, one 1, and one 7. The current bid is '2 7s'. Looking at my hand, I have one 7, so there's at least one 7 in play. The opponent has bid that there are at least 2 7s total between our hands. Since I have one 7, this means they're claiming they have at least one 7 in their hand as well. This is quite possible and not a suspicious claim at all. Given that I have one 7 myself, I'm inclined to believe their bid. I should make a higher bid based on what I know about my hand. I have two 6s, so I could safely bid '2 8s' or '2 9s' (increasing the digit), or I could bid '3 0s' through '3 9s' (increasing the quantity). Since I have one 9 in my hand, bidding '2 9s' seems reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, making the current bid of 2 9s suspect. Challenging is a strategic move to test if Player 1 is bluffing, as the likelihood of having exactly two 9s is uncertain and potentially low.
