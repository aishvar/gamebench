Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand '39816590', I have two 9s, two 8s, two 1s, one 3, one 5, zero 2s, four different digits appearing once or twice. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 8s, since I already have two 8s myself, making it very likely true.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s would be risky as it relies entirely on my opponent having at least two 8s. However, I have two 4s. Bidding 3 4s is a reasonable move, increasing the quantity while choosing a digit I possess. It's a plausible bid and doesn't immediately signal weakness.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 3, 9, 8, 1, 6, 5, 9, 0. I have no 4s, so the opponent is relying entirely on their own hand for the count of 4s. The current bid is 3 4s, which requires at least 3 total 4s between both hands. Since I have zero, the opponent would need all 3 or more, which is unlikely with 8 digits. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
