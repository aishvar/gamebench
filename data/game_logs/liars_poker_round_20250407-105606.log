Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 2s, two 7s, one 1, one 9, and one 6. The most frequent digits in my hand are 0, 2, and 7, each appearing twice. A conservative yet reasonable opening bid is 2 2s, as I hold two 2s myself, making it likely there are at least two total. This is a safe starting point that puts some pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.
