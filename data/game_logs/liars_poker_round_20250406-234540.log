Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. As the first bidder, starting with 3 8s is a strategic opening that leverages my existing 8s while accounting for potential 8s in the opponent's hand. This bid forces the opponent to either challenge (with ~57% chance of me winning given random distribution) or raise the bid to 4+ of any digit, maintaining pressure.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. The maximum number of 8s possible is 16. I could bid 3 9s, or 4 of any digit. I will bid 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, so the opponent must have all 4 claimed 0s. The probability of an opponent holding exactly 4 zeros in their 8-card hand is approximately 5% (calculated via binomial distribution). Given the low likelihood and common bluffing patterns in Liar's Poker, challenging is statistically favorable.
