Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. Since it's the first bid, starting with 3 2s is a reasonable choice, assuming the opponent has at least one 2.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have zero 2s in my hand (08683398). For the bid to be accurate, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least three 2s in their 8-digit hand. The statistical likelihood of one player holding three or more of a specific digit out of eight is quite low. Since I hold none of the bid digit, the probability of the bid being true is significantly reduced. Therefore, challenging the bid is the most strategically sound move.
