Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid, I should make a reasonable starting bid. I have two 8s, one 6, one 5, one 3, one 2, and two 1s. A safe starting bid would be to bid 1 of the digit 1. It's unlikely the opponent has many 1s, and it's a low risk bid to start with.

Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid. I have two 8s, one 6, one 5, one 3, one 2, and two 1s. Bidding on 8 seems reasonable as I have two of them. A bid of '8 2' (two 8s) is a good starting point, as it's likely to be achievable and doesn't reveal too much information about my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to assess the likelihood of there being 8 or more 2s total. In my hand, I have one 2. For the opponent's bid of '8 2s' to be valid, they would need to have 7 or more 2s in their hand. This is extremely unlikely as it would require almost their entire hand to be 2s (7 out of 8 digits). The probability of having 7 or more 2s in 8 random digits is very low. Even if they're bluffing strategically, this bid seems too aggressive. Therefore, I should challenge.
