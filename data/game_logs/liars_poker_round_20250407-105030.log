Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 6, 8, 6 and 0 in my hand. Since there are no bids yet, I can start with any digit. I have two 6s, so bidding on 6s seems reasonable.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. Given that the current bid is quite low, I should try to make a reasonable bid that is higher. The current bid is for 6s, and I have one 6 in my hand. I also have other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. A bid of 3 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 6s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 2, 7, 9, 2, 4, 5, 0, and 3. I have one 6 in my hand, but I don't have enough 6s to make a higher quantity bid. I should consider bidding a higher digit or quantity if possible, or challenge if the bid seems unlikely.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s, and I have a 6 in my hand. I can increase the quantity to 6, as it's a reasonable assumption that I have at least one more 6.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 2, 7, 9, 2, 4, 5, 0, and 3. I have one 6 which could contribute to the count but not enough to confidently increase the quantity of 6s. However, I do have two 7s and other high digits. Since the current bid is 6 6s, I should consider if I can safely bid higher. Given that I only have one digit that could contribute to a 6 or 7 bid (one 6 and no 7s), I should be cautious. The bid history shows a steady increase in the quantity of 6s. I will challenge the bid because I think it's unlikely that there are 6 or more 6s in total, given that I only have one 6 and no information about Player 0's hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) challenges Player 0's (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bid of 6 6s.
