Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand. Since this is the first bid, I can start with a reasonable quantity. Bidding four 5s is a good starting point, as it's plausible that the total number of 5s across both hands is at least four.

Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand. The current bid is 5 5s, which would require at least two more 5s in the opponent's hand. Given that I only have three, the total is unlikely to reach five. Challenging this bid seems reasonable.
