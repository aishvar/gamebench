Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 8s, and one each of 5, 2, 1, 7, and 9. The most promising starting bid is for 2 3s or 2 8s, as I already hold two of each. To be conservative yet competitive, I'll start with a bid of 2 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 52318379, I have one 9. The current bid is 2 9s, which means there must be at least one 9 in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. Since it's plausible the opponent has one 9, the bid is reasonable and challenging now is risky. A safe next bid is 3 9s, as it's quite possible there are 3 total 9s across both hands, or at least it puts pressure back on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 52318379, which contains zero 0s. The opponent's bid of 4 0s implies there are at least four zeros total across both hands. Since I have none, all four would have to be in their hand, which is very unlikely given they only have eight digits. The probability of someone having four or more zeros in eight digits is low, making this bid suspicious and a good opportunity to challenge.
