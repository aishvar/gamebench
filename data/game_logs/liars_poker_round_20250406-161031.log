Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and it's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 68636415, which contains three 6s, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 5, and one 8. With 16 total digits in play (2 players * 8 digits), the expected average count for any digit is 1.6. Having three 6s is well above average. It is statistically probable that the other player has at least one 6. Therefore, a bid of '4 6s' is a strong but reasonable opening bid based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have 9,9,7,0,2,8,0,2, which contains zero 6s. Since there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's, the total number of 6s must be at least 4 to satisfy the current bid. Given I have zero 6s, the opponent would need all 4 or more 6s in their hand, which is statistically unlikely (chance of 4 or more 6s in 8 digits is quite low). Therefore, it's a good opportunity to challenge the bid.
