Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 37036911, which contains two 1s, one 3s, two 6s, one 7s, and one 9s. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. I have the most 3s and 6s (two each), so bidding on either is reasonable. I'll bid on 6s with a quantity of 2, as it's a digit I have twice.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 6s (digits: 6, 8, 2, 7, 0, 2, 6, 1). The current bid is 2 6s, which is easily covered by my own hand alone. Since I already hold three 6s, it is statistically likely there are even more 6s in total, or at least enough to safely raise. A reasonable next bid would be 3 6s, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I had previously bid 2 6s, and my hand is 37036911, which contains two 6s. The bid increased by one 6, which is plausible since the total count of 6s across both hands could be more than my initial bid. However, I can bid higher. I have two 6s, so the total count of 6s must be at least 2. I can try to bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 4 and keeping the digit the same or higher would be a valid move. Since I don't have information about the other digits in the opponent's hand, I'll consider a reasonable increase. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid because it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 68270261, I have two 6s and one 7. The current bid is 3 7s. Since I only have one 7, Player 0 would need to have at least two 7s for the bid to be valid. That is somewhat unlikely. Additionally, I don't have enough 7s to confidently raise the bid on 7s. Switching back to 6s, I already know I have two 6s, and the prior bid was 3 6s, so I can safely increase the quantity to 4 6s, which is a higher bid and plausible given my hand and potential distribution.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand is 37036911, which contains two 6s and no 7s or higher relevant digits that could directly influence the count of 6s or higher digits. The bid history shows an escalation between 6s and 7s. Since I have two 6s, and the total count of 6s must be at least 2 (from my hand) plus at least 2 (from the opponent's hand, because they bid 4 6s), it seems plausible they have at least two 6s. However, I can bid higher than 4 6s by either increasing the quantity or changing the digit to a higher one. I can bid 4 7s or higher quantity with 6s. Since I don't have any 7s, bidding 4 7s might be risky unless my opponent has a lot of 7s. Bidding 5 6s is a safer option as it directly builds upon the current bid without changing the digit, and it's still within a reasonable range given the total count of digits is 16. Thus, I will increase the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s. The current bid is 5 6s, so the opponent is claiming there are at least five 6s across both hands. Since I hold two, this means they are implying there are at least three 6s in their own hand, which is quite unlikely given the distributionâ€”on average, each digit appears about 1.6 times per hand. Five total 6s is on the high side and a risky bid, especially since the previous bids escalated quickly. Therefore, I believe the bid is unlikely to be valid and the best move is to challenge.
