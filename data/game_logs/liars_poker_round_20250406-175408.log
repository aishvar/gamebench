Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. Since the opponent is a naive player, I don't have much information to gain from their bid. I can safely raise the bid to 2 1s, as I have one 1 in my hand. This is a small, safe increment.
