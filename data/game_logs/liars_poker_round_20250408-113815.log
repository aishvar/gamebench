Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is None. I should start with a bid that's based on my hand, so I'll bid 2 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (27165530). This means the bid is true if the opponent has at least one 6, which is statistically likely (expected 0.8 6s in their 8 digits). Challenging seems risky. I should make a higher bid. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a valid higher bid (increasing quantity from 2 to 3). This bid only requires the opponent to have at least one 5, which is also statistically likely. This seems like a strong and relatively safe bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I hold one 6, meaning the opponent (Player 0) needs three 6s for the bid to be accurate. Player 0 previously bid 2 6s and then raised to 4 6s after my bid of 3 5s. While having three 6s is possible, it's uncertain. Instead of challenging, I can make a stronger bid based on my hand. I have two 5s. Bidding 5 5s is a valid higher bid (increasing the quantity). This requires a total of five 5s across all 16 digits. Since I hold two, the opponent would need three 5s for this bid to be true. This seems like a reasonable possibility and puts the decision back on the opponent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 6 5s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Player 0 bids: 6 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I hold two 5s (27165530). For the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must hold at least four 5s in their 8-digit hand. This is statistically unlikely (expected value is 0.8 5s per 8 digits). Player 0 previously bid 6s (2 6s, then 4 6s) before switching to 5s after I bid 3 5s and 5 5s. This switch suggests they might be bluffing or reacting to my bids rather than holding a strong hand of 5s. Making a higher bid, such as 6 6s (requiring 5 from the opponent, as I have one 6) or 7 of any digit (requiring 6 or 7 from the opponent depending on my hand), seems even less likely to be true than the current bid. Therefore, challenging the 6 5s bid appears to be the safest and most statistically sound move.
