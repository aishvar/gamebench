Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. With no current bid, I should make a bid with a high quantity and digit. I notice I have a 9, so I'll start with a high digit, 9.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 1 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand has two 3s and no 9s. The current bid is 1 9s. Since I have zero 9s, Player 0 needs at least one 9 to make their bid valid. However, challenging a low bid of 1 is risky as there's a ~57% chance they might have a 9. A safer move is to bid 2 3s - this strictly increases the quantity, and since I already have two 3s, the total count will be at least 2 regardless of Player 0's hand.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have a 3 in my hand. I should make a bid with a higher quantity or a higher digit. Bidding 3 3s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 3S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s, meaning the opponent likely has at least one 3. Challenging risks losing if they have one. To bid higher safely, I can target a higher digit with the same quantity. I have one 4, so bidding 3 4s maintains the quantity but increases the digit. This forces the opponent to either challenge (if they lack sufficient 4s) or bid higher, shifting risk to them.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 4S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 4 4s increases both quantity and digit based on my hand, making it a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 4S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand has two 3s and one 4. The opponent's bid of 4 4s suggests they might have 3-4 fours. Bidding 5 3s leverages their previous 3 3s bid (indicating they likely have at least 3 threes) combined with my two, making 5 total 3s plausible. This bid increases quantity while using a digit with some existing support.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 3S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 5 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 6 3s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 3S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid is 6 3s, requiring the opponent to have at least four 3s. Given the total of 16 digits, this bid is aggressive. While the opponent's bidding pattern suggests confidence, the required four 3s in their hand seems unlikely. Challenging now tests their bluff, as falling short of six total would secure victory.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) challenges Player 0's (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bid of 6 3s.
