Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have multiple 5s and 6s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and I have a good number of digits in my hand, I can start with a low to moderate bid. I will bid 3 5s as there are at least three 5s in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to evaluate whether to challenge or make a higher bid than '3 5s'. Looking at my hand (50613339), I have one 5 in my hand. For there to be at least 3 5s total, the other two players would need to have at least 2 more 5s between them, which is quite reasonable. Since I know there's at least one 5 (mine), and each player has 8 digits, there could easily be 3 or more 5s total. I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. I could bid '4 5s', but I'm not confident there are that many. Instead, I'll increase the digit to 6, which I have one of in my hand. So I'll bid '3 6s', which is higher than '3 5s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity.

Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 8 in my hand and no 6s. The bid history shows an increase from 3 5s to 3 6s, indicating a possible presence of 6s among other players. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have any 6s, I'll consider increasing the digit. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit. However, I should also consider the likelihood of other players having higher digits. Alternatively, I can challenge if I think 3 6s is too high. Given that there are 24 digits in total and the bid is relatively low, I'll choose to bid higher rather than challenge.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 7s in my hand, which makes a total of at least 2 7s for me. Given that there are 3 players and 8 secret digits each, the maximum possible 7s could be 24. However, bidding 3 7s seems reasonable but I should try to increase the quantity or digit. I have one 8 in my hand, so bidding 3 8s seems risky but plausible given the distribution. However, I can try to increase the quantity to 4 and maintain a high digit, as I do not have many high digits.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid than '4 7s'. Looking at my hand (50613339), I have zero 7s. The current bid claims there are at least 4 sevens total. Since I have none, all 4 would need to be distributed between the other two players' hands. This is possible but not guaranteed. Let me analyze further: I've already revealed I had at least one 6 with my earlier bid. Player 2 then bid 3 7s, suggesting they might have at least one 7. Player 0 then raised to 4 7s, which could mean they have multiple 7s or are bluffing. Given that I have no 7s and the bid is still relatively low (only 4 out of a possible 24 digits), I think it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I could bid '4 8s' or '5 0s'. Since I have one 0, one 3, two 3s, and one 9 in my hand, bidding '5 0s' seems riskier than '4 8s'. I'll go with '4 8s'.

Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I don't have information about the other players' hands, I'll consider my hand and the bid history. Bidding 5 8s seems risky as it significantly increases the quantity. However, bidding 4 9s is a safer option as it keeps the same quantity and increases the digit. I'll choose to bid 4 9s.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 7, 5, 6, 5, 2, 4, 3, and 3. I have a total of 2 sixes, 2 fives, and 1 each of 7, 4, 3, and 2, and 2 threes. The maximum possible quantity for any digit across all players' hands is 24. Given that I have 2 sixes and the current bid is 4 9s, I should consider if there's a high likelihood that there are 4 or more 9s in total. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should assess the likelihood of there being 4 or more 9s. If I bid 5 0s, it seems unlikely given my hand and the hands of others are secret, but I do not have enough information to accurately assess the number of 9s. However, I do see that bidding 5 3s could be a possibility since I have two 3s and it seems reasonable that others might have a few 3s as well, given the distribution of digits.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. In my hand, I have two 3s, which is significant given the current bid of '5 3s'. For there to be at least 5 threes total, the other two players would need to have at least 3 more threes between them. This is certainly possible, but not guaranteed. Looking at the bidding history, we've been escalating steadily. Player 0 has now dropped back to digit 3 but increased the quantity to 5. Since I have two 3s in my hand, I know that's 2/5 of the claimed amount. The remaining 3 threes would need to be split between the other two players, which is plausible but not certain. I could bid '5 4s' to continue the game, but I only have one 4 in my hand, which makes me less confident. I could also bid '6 0s', '6 1s', or '6 3s' since I have those digits in my hand. Given that I have two 3s, I think challenging is too risky. I'll bid '5 4s' to keep the game going while testing if others will challenge or continue bidding.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. My hand is 07791148, which contains one 4. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since there are 24 digits in total and 3 players, a bid of 5 4s implies that the other players have at least 4 other 4s. I'm not confident in that. I have one 4, so it's possible there are 4 or more 4s in total, but bidding higher on 4s seems risky. However, I can bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. I will bid 5 5s, as it's a higher digit and I have one 5 in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 6s and one 5. Given that the last bid was 5 5s, I should try to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s, bidding 6 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. In my hand (50613339), I have zero 6s. The current bid is 6 6s. Since I have 8 digits in my hand and each player has 8 digits, there are 24 total digits in play. For there to be at least 6 6s, Player 0 and Player 2 would need to have 6 or more 6s between them. While possible, this seems unlikely. Player 0 has been steadily increasing bids and jumped from 5 5s to 6 6s, which could indicate they have several 6s, but it could also be a bluff. Given I have zero 6s in my hand and would need to bid either 7 of some digit or 6 of a digit higher than 6, I think challenging is the better option here.
