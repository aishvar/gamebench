Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 32288905. I see that I have two 2s, one 8, and one 9. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. Bidding on a digit I have seems logical. I have the most 2s, so bidding on 2s is a good start. The minimum bid is a quantity of 1 for any digit. I can bid higher than that by increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 2s, I can bid 2 2s, which is a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 31267914, I have zero 2s. The current bid is 2 2s, which means there must be at least two 2s across both hands. Since I have none, all 2s must be in my opponent's hand, which is unlikely but possible. Rather than challenge this low bid, a safer strategy is to increase the bid modestly on a digit I do have. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding 3 1s is a reasonable and minimal raise, leveraging my known cards.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 1S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. My hand is 32288905, which contains one 1. This means there are at least 2 1s in total. I can bid higher than 3 1s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I see one 1, I can reasonably assume there could be more. Bidding 3 2s is a safe move as it increases the digit, and I have one 2 in my hand, making it slightly more believable.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (31267914), I have one 2 and two 1s. The current bid is 3 2s, which requires at least three 2s in total. Since I only have one 2, Player 0 would need to have at least two 2s for the bid to be valid. This is plausible but somewhat unlikely. Alternatively, I can make a higher bid. Given that I have two 1s myself, a safe incremental bid would be 3 3s or 3 4s, but better would be to increase the quantity. Since I have two 1s, bidding 4 1s seems reasonable, as it only requires Player 0 to have two 1s, which is quite likely. Therefore, I will bid 4 1s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 8, one 9, one 5, and one 0, with the rest being lower digits. I can see that I have no 1s. The probability of having more than 4 ones between the two of us is low, but not impossible. However, I can try to bid on a higher digit or increase the quantity on a digit I think is more likely. I have two 2s, so bidding on 2s seems reasonable. The last bid on 2s was 3 2s by me. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity to 4 or keep the quantity at 3 and bid on a higher digit. Since I have two 2s, I can confidently bid 4 2s, increasing the quantity.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 31267914, I have zero 2s, so the opponent is relying entirely on their own hand for the count of 2s to reach 4. Since I have none, for the bid of 4 2s to be valid, the opponent must have all four 2s in their hand, which is unlikely given the distribution of digits and total of 8 digits per player. Therefore, the bid of 4 2s is improbable and challenging is the best move.
