Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 1, one 2, one 3, two 4s, one 5, one 6, and one 9. Since this is the opening bid, I should make a conservative bid based on what I know for certain. With two 4s in my hand, bidding '3 4s' is reasonable as it only requires the opponent to have one more 4, which is quite possible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '4' in my hand. The current bid is '3 4s', meaning the opponent believes there are at least three '4's total. Given I already have one, it's plausible that the opponent has at least two more. With 16 digits in total, the bid of '3 4s' is reasonable. However, I have multiple '7's (two in my hand), making it safer to bid higher on '7's. Increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same is a safer move based on my known digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have my hand of 8 digits and can see there is only one 7 in it. For the opponent's bid of '3 7s' to be true, they would need at least 2 more 7s in their hand. While possible, given I have a good mix of digits and only one 7, it seems somewhat unlikely they would have multiple 7s. Additionally, they raised from my '3 4s' bid to '3 7s' which could be a bluff to try to take control with a higher digit. Based on probability and having direct visibility of only one 7, I think challenging is the better option than making a higher bid.
