Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits: 1, 8, 0, 7, 4, 7, 6, 1. The digit '1' appears twice, '7' appears twice, and others appear once. A safe opening bid is typically on a digit I have at least two of, so I will open with '2 1', indicating at least two '1's across both hands. This is a conservative but reasonable opening bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 1s'. I have one '1' in my hand (83138509). For the bid to be false, the opponent (Player 0) must have zero '1's in their 8 digits. The probability of this is relatively low ((9/10)^8 â‰ˆ 43%). Therefore, the bid '2 1s' is likely true, and challenging is risky. I should make a higher bid. I need to bid more than '2 1s' (either quantity > 2 or digit > 1). I have two '3's in my hand. Bidding '2 3s' is a safe bid, as I hold the required quantity myself, making the bid guaranteed to be true regardless of the opponent's hand. It is also a valid increase from '2 1s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 18074761, which contains zero 3s. The current bid is 2 3s. Since I have none, for Player 1's bid to be valid, they must have at least 2 or more 3s in their own hand. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely given the distribution across 8 digits. The chance Player 1 holds 2 or more 3s is relatively low, making their bid risky. Instead of raising, the optimal move is to challenge, as I believe the total number of 3s is less than 2.
