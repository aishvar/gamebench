Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand, making it the digit I have the most of. Bidding 2 1s is a safe and reasonable starting point since I know there are at least two 1s in play. This bid is unlikely to be challenged immediately and provides a solid foundation for future moves.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 1s in my hand. The current bid is 2 1s. Given that I have no 1s, the total number of 1s in both hands is at most 2, but it's possible that Player 0 has exactly 2 1s. However, challenging this bid is a calculated risk because if Player 0 has fewer than 2 1s, I win.
