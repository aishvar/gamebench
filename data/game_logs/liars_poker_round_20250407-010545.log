--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 35592607. I have two 5s, which is the digit I hold the most of. With 16 total digits in play (2 players * 8 digits), the expected number of any digit is 1.6. Having two 5s is slightly above average. It's statistically plausible that the opponent has at least one 5 among their 8 digits. Therefore, bidding '3 5s' is a reasonable opening bid. It leverages my strongest digit, puts some pressure on the opponent, and is statistically justifiable (based on my two 5s and the likelihood of the opponent having at least one).

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand, so the total could be up to three if Player 0 has two. However, it's possible the total is less than three, making challenging a viable option.
