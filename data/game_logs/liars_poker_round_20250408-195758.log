Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 59098047, which gives me two 0s. Knowing that there are at least two 0s in total because of my hand, I can safely raise the bid from 1 0s to 2 0s. This bid is strictly higher than 1 0s and leverages the certainty provided by my own cards.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand (59098047) contains no 1s, so I have no support for the current bid of 2 1s. With only 8 unknown digits in Player 0's hand, the chance that there are at least 2 ones overall is very low (roughly an 18-19% chance). Given these odds, challenging the bid is the most sensible move.
