Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (40693045), I see I have two 4s and no other digit more than twice. A reasonable starting bid could be '2 4s' as it reflects the count of one of the digits in my hand. However, to be cautious and not reveal too much, I might consider bidding on a different digit. I have zeros, fours, and no other repeated digits, so bidding on a digit I have could be a good strategy. Bidding '2 0s' seems like a safe and reasonable first bid because it is based on my hand and is not too high.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 35812817, there are no 0s. Since the total number of digits is 16, and I have zero 0s, for the bid of 2 0s to be correct, the opponent must have at least two 0s. This is possible but not guaranteed. However, a bid of 2 0s is quite conservative, and challenging it now is risky. Instead, I can safely increase the bid by quantity or digit. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding 2 1s matches the quantity but with a higher digit, which is a valid and safe next bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have one 1 in my hand (since my hand is 40693045), and there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand, making 16 total digits. The current bid suggests there are at least two 1s in total. Given that I have one 1, it's plausible that the opponent has at least one 1. However, to progress the game and potentially gain an advantage, I should bid higher. I can see that I have two 4s and one 0. Bidding 3 4s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity and changes the digit to one that I have more of.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 4S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 35812817, I have two 1s and no 4s. The current bid is 3 4s. Since I have zero 4s, and it's unlikely the opponent has all 3 or more 4s (as that would require at least 3 or 4s in their 8 digits), I think the bid is risky for them. The probability that there are 3 or more 4s total is low given my zero count. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
