--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Analyzing my hand (01880950), I see two 0s, two 8s, one 1, one 9, one 5, and one 0 again (already counted). The most frequent digits are 0 and 8, each appearing twice. A conservative and strategic opening bid would be 2 of either 0s or 8s. I will choose 2 eights (2 8s) as my opening bid, as 8s tend to be strong mid-value digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. My hand contains no 8s, so I cannot make a higher bid for 8s. Since the maximum possible 8s is 2 (from Player 0's bid) and I have none, challenging is the only logical move.
