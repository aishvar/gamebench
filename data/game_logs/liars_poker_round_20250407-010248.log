Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 3, one 5, one 1, one 6, one 2, one 4, one 0, and one 7. Since this is the opening bid and I know exactly what I have, I should start with a conservative bid based on a digit I actually see in my hand. Making a bid of '2 3s' is reasonable - I have one 3, and it's likely the opponent has at least one more 3 across their 8 digits. This is a safe opening bid that leaves room for the bidding to develop.

Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and I only have one 3, it's unlikely that there are more than 3 3s in total. However, I have one 9, which is the highest digit. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable move, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I can see my entire hand (35162407) and there are no 9s in it. For the opponent's bid of '3 9s' to be true, they would need to have at least 3 nines in their hand. While possible, this seems unlikely given it would require them to use 3/8 of their digits on 9s. Given I have zero 9s and the relatively high claim of 3 nines, challenging is the safer play than trying to bid higher.
