Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 5s, and one of several other digits. A conservative opening bid would be 2 8s, as I already have two in my hand and there's a high likelihood that Player 1 also has at least one 8.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 8s. Since there are only 16 digits in total, the likelihood of there being at least 2 8s is relatively low. However, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity or the digit. Considering my hand, I have two 9s, so I can safely bid 3 9s, which is higher than the current bid in both quantity and digit.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 9s. This means there must be at least two more 9s in Player 1's hand for the bid to hold. While possible, it is not guaranteed. Instead of challenging, I can safely make a higher bid. I also have two 8s in my hand, so bidding 4 8s is reasonable as it increases the quantity while shifting to a digit I have more of.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 8s. Since I already bid 3 9s previously, I need to increase both the quantity and the digit. Bidding 5 9s seems reasonable, as it increases both the quantity and the digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 9S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 5 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 5 9s, which means there must be at least 5 nines across both hands. Given that there are only 16 digits total and I only have one 9, it is unlikely for there to be 4 more 9s in Player 1's hand. This makes the bid highly suspect, so I will challenge.
