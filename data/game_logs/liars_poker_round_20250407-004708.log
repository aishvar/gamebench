Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid. I will start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s and two 3s. A bid of '2 3s' or '2 6s' seems reasonable. I will choose to bid '2 6s' as it's a good starting point and higher than any potential digit count I have for 3.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, which allows me to make a higher bid than the current 2 6s by choosing a higher digit. Bidding 2 7s is a valid move as it exceeds the previous bid in digit value.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 5, 3, 2, 0, 6, 1, 3, and 6. I can see there's a possibility of having higher digits or quantities. Since the bid is 2 7s, I should either increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it's higher than 2 7s and aligns with my available digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s. Bidding 3 7s is a higher bid because 7 is a higher digit than 6. Given that I have two 7s, if Player 0 has at least one 7, the bid will be valid. This seems like a reasonable move considering the current bid and my hand composition.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. I have two 6s in my hand, and the previous bids have been relatively conservative. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s and the last bid was 3 7s, I can try to bid higher with a reasonable chance of winning. I will increase the quantity and bid 4 6s, as it's a higher digit than 7 and I have two 6s in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, and the current bid is 4 6s. Considering the bid history and the possibility that the opponent might not have enough 6s, challenging is a strategic move to test the validity of the bid.
