Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8, one 4, two 6s, one 5, one 7, and one 3. Since this is the opening bid and I have two 6s in my hand, starting with a bid of '3 6s' is reasonable. This assumes the opponent might have at least one more 6, which is plausible. Starting with a moderate bid gives room for the bidding to develop while being based on what I can see in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand (47130927). For the current bid to be true, the opponent must hold at least three 6s. While possible, this is uncertain. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid is strongly supported by my hand, requiring only one 7 from the opponent's 8 digits to be true, which is statistically likely. This seems safer and more strategic than challenging the 3 6s bid or making a riskier bid like 4 of something.

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The opponent bid 3 7s total, meaning they believe there are at least 2 more 7s in their hand. While possible, this seems a bit high. However, since I do have one 7 confirmed, challenging would be risky as they only need 2 more to be correct. Instead, I'll bid 3 8s - keeping the same quantity but going up one digit. This is a safer play since I have an 8 in my hand, and it forces them to either bid higher or challenge me.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 47130927. The current bid is 3 8s, made by Player 0. I have zero 8s in my hand. For the bid of '3 8s' to be true, Player 0 must hold at least three 8s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-card hand is statistically low (approximately 3.8%). Given I have no 8s to contribute, the likelihood of the bid being valid is very small. Therefore, challenging the bid is the most strategically sound move.
