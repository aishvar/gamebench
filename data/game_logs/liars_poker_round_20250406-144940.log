Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 2 0s is a safe starting bid since I know there are at least two 0s. This gives a solid foundation while allowing others to either raise the quantity or bid a higher digit.

Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 2 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. The bid seems a bit low considering the total count of digits is 32 across all players. I can bid higher. I will increase the quantity to 3 and keep the digit at 0, as it's the lowest. This is a relatively safe bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 4 0s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and it's a plausible bid given that there are four players with eight cards each. Bidding a higher digit would require me to assume other players have that digit, which is less certain. Increasing the quantity of 0s is the safest option.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand (69313296), I have zero 0s. Since the current bid is 4 0s and I hold none, the likelihood that the other three players collectively hold at least four 0s is low. On average, each digit appears roughly 3 times in 32 digits (since 32/10 â‰ˆ 3.2). A bid of 4 0s is slightly above average and given I have none, it's somewhat unlikely. Therefore, challenging is the best strategic move.
