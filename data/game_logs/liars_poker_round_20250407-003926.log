Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 5s, two 2s, and other digits. Bidding 2 5s is a safe starting point, as it's likely to be true given my hand and the total of 16 digits in play.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my hand contains two 6s, I can confidently bid on a higher digit. The current bid is low, so I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. Given that I have two 6s, bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which means there must be at least one more 6 in the other player's hand. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on the possibility of the other player having at least one 6.

Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Given that the bid history shows an increase in quantity but not digit, and considering my hand, I should try to make a higher bid. Since I have one 6, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I have a 7, 2, 3, 3, and 8 in my hand, but no other 6s. A reasonable bid could be higher than 4 6s, considering I have one 6. I could bid 5 6s or change the digit to something higher and adjust quantity accordingly. However, I don't have enough information about Player 0's hand. Given my digits, bidding 5 7s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, which makes the current bid of 5 7s plausible but not overwhelmingly so. However, I don't have enough 7s to confidently bid higher on 7s. Instead, I can bid on a digit I have more of. I have three 5s, which allows me to bid 6 5s, increasing both quantity and digit compared to the current bid.

Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 6 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I need to analyze my hand and the bid history. My hand contains the digits: 7, 2, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8. I have a total of 3 eights and two 6s, but no 5s. The bid history shows increasing quantities and digits. Given that I have no 5s, I should be cautious. However, I have a significant number of high digits, particularly 8s and 6s. Since I have two 6s and the current bid is 6 5s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 7 6s seems reasonable as it's higher than the previous 6 5s and utilizes my available high digits.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 7 6s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have two 6s, bidding 8 6s is risky. However, I can bid 7 7s, which increases the digit while keeping the same quantity. This seems reasonable given my hand, which contains two 7s, making it plausible to reach a total of 7 7s when combined with the other player's hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 7S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 7 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains 3 6s and 2 7s and 3 3s and 1 8. Given that the last bid was 7 7s, I must decide if I can reasonably make a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and there are only 8 digits in total for both players, a bid higher than 7 seems unlikely to be valid. However, I can try to make a bid that seems reasonable based on my hand and the bid history.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 3S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 8 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 3s. My hand contains two 3s, and considering both players' hands, it's possible there are more 3s. However, the bid history shows a pattern of increasing quantity and digit. Given the previous bids, it's reasonable to assume there might not be 8 3s in total. I should challenge this bid as it seems unlikely based on the current information.
