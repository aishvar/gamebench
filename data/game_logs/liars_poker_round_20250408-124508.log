Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, and one 8. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 0s, as I already hold two zeros myself, making it quite likely or certain that there are at least two zeros overall.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 74629987, containing digits 7, 4, 6, 2, 9, 9, 8, and 7. I have no zeros in my hand. The current bid is '2 0s', meaning Player 0 believes there are at least two zeros across both players' hands. Given that I have none, Player 0 must have at least two zeros themselves. While it's plausible they have two zeros, I cannot be certain. However, since the bid is quite low and plausible, challenging seems risky. Instead, I will make a cautious higher bid based on my own hand. I have two 7s and two 9s, so bidding '2 9s' is a safe and reasonable increase, as it's the same quantity but a higher digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (85623040), I have two 0s, zero 9s, one 8, one 5, one 6, one 2, one 3, and one 4. The current bid is 2 9s, and since I hold no 9s, the opponent would have to hold both 9s to make the bid valid, which is plausible but not certain. However, I can confidently outbid by increasing the digit with the same quantity. Since I have two 0s, bidding 2 9s was already matched by my initial 2 0s bid. The next valid higher bid would be 2 of any digit higher than 9, which is impossible, or increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I can bid 3 of a digit I have multiples of. Given I have two 0s, it's reasonable to expect at least one 0 in the opponent's hand, making 3 0s a safe and higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 74629987, containing digits 7,4,6,2,9,9,8,7 and no 0s. The current bid is 3 0s. Since I have zero 0s, all three 0s would need to be in my opponent's eight-digit hand. While it's possible, it's not highly likely. However, considering the small quantity (3), it's not entirely improbable. To avoid unnecessary risk, I can safely bid higher on digits I have multiple copies of. I have two 7s and two 9s, making a bid of 3 7s or 3 9s plausible. I'll choose 3 9s, as I already previously bid on 9s, and I have two myself, making it a credible and safer bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 85623040, which contains two 0s and zero 9s. The current bid is 3 9s. Since I have no 9s, for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need to have all 3 or more 9s. With 8 digits in their hand, having 3 or more 9s is possible but not very likely, especially since they previously increased the bid from 2 to 3 9s, which could be a bluff. Given the low likelihood that there are at least 3 nines between both hands, challenging is the best option.
