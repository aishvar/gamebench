Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game, so I need to make an opening bid. My hand contains two 3s, two 6s, one 7, one 8, one 0, and one 5. Starting with a moderate bid based on my hand, I choose 3 6s since I have two 6s and it is reasonable to assume at least one more 6 in the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, making the current bid of 3 6s potentially valid if the opponent has two more. However, without certainty, challenging is a safer move to test the validity of the bid.
