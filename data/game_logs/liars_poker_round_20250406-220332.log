Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 2 9s is a safe move because the total number of 9s cannot be less than 2, ensuring I win if challenged. This bid is strategic as it forces the opponent into a difficult position to counter.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s, which means Player 0 is claiming there is at least one more 9 in their hand. Since the bid is still low and I have one 9, it's reasonable to increase the bid slightly to test their confidence.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s, which means the opponent must have at least one more 9 to make the bid valid. Since the bid is relatively low and I have one 9, it's plausible that the opponent also has one. Therefore, I will challenge the bid to see if the opponent indeed has another 9.
