Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 5s, two 0s, one 3, and one 1. A safe and strategic opening bid would be 2 8s, reflecting the two 8s I hold, as it's likely there may be more 8s in the opponent's hand, but this sets a reasonable baseline.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s but two 8s. The current bid is 2 9s, which is plausible since I don't have any 9s, so the opponent might have two or more. However, since I have two 8s, a safe and natural raise is to bid 2 9s -> 3 8s, increasing the quantity and switching to a digit I hold multiple of, which strengthens my position.
