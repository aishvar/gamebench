Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I see two 0s. The current bid is only 1 0s, so I already have two myself. Since there are 8 unknown digits in Player 0's hand, it's quite plausible that there are even more 0s. Therefore, a safe and strategic move is to increase the quantity to 2 0s, which I can confidently back up based on my own hand.
