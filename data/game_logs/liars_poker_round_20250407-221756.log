--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 8s, one 5, two 0s, and one 2. A safe and strategic opening bid is typically 2 of a digit I have multiple of, to avoid overcommitting early. I will start with '2 9s' because I hold two 9s, making this a solid and defensible opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. Given my hand, 20444556, I do not have any 9s. However, I have a significant number of 4s and 5s. Since my goal is to make a strictly higher bid or challenge, and considering I don't have any 9s to support the current bid, I should look for an opportunity to bid on a digit I have more of or challenge if the current bid seems unlikely. Given that I have three 4s and two 5s, bidding on either of these digits could be a good strategy. However, since the current bid is on 9s, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit value. Bidding on 4s or 5s directly might not be the best strategy since I don't have enough to confidently surpass the current bid in a significant way without risking an immediate challenge. Considering the digits I have, a more cautious approach might be necessary, but given the low quantity of the current bid, I might consider challenging it if I think two 9s are unlikely across both hands, or find a digit with a higher value or sufficient quantity to bid on. Since I have no 9s and the bid is low, challenging seems like a viable option, especially if I consider that the opponent might be bluffing with a low quantity bid.
