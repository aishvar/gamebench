Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have two 0s, one 2, one 7, two 2s, one 9, and one 1 in my hand. A conservative but valid first bid would be 1 0s, as I know there are at least two 0s in play. This is a safe starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, and the current bid is 1 0s. Since I can see one 0 in my hand, it's likely there are at least two 0s in total. I can safely increase the bid to 2 0s, which is a valid higher bid based on the rules.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have three 0s in my hand. Bidding 3 0s is a natural progression and likely to be accurate given my hand. It's a safe bid that increases the quantity while staying on the same digit.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s. I can increase the bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have no 0s, increasing the digit to 4 and bidding 3 4s is not possible as I only have two 4s. However, I can bid 4 4s, increasing both the quantity and the digit, which seems reasonable based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 4s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit to 5 seems reasonable, and bidding 5 5s is a plausible next step. Even if my opponent has a few 5s, it's unlikely they have enough to reach 5 total. Bidding 5 5s is a strategic move to test their hand without making an overly aggressive claim.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 5S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 5 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 5s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and I don't contribute any 5s, the likelihood of there being 5 or more 5s across both hands is very low. It's safer to challenge the bid rather than attempting a higher bid without confidence.
