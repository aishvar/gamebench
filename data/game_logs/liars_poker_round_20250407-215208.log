--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. My hand contains the digits 0, 8, 8, 0, 9, 3, 7, 4. Notably, I have two 0s and two 8s, which are good starting points. Opening with a bid of two 8s is reasonable because I already hold two 8s, making it likely the total count is at least two, and possibly more. This is a safe and strategic opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have two 9s in my hand. I could bid 2 9s, but that only increases the bid by digit. I could also bid 3 of any digit. I have two 1s, so I will bid 3 1s. This is a safe bid, as I have two 1s already, and it is not unreasonable that there is at least one more 1 between the two hands.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 ones. Looking at my hand (08809374), I have zero '1's. Since I have none, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have all 3 or more '1's in their hand of 8 digits. Statistically, the expected number of '1's in a random 8-digit hand is less than 1 (since each digit has a 1/10 chance). Having 3 or more '1's is unlikely, making the bid suspicious. Therefore, it's strategically sound to challenge rather than raise the bid.
