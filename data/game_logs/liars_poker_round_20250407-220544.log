Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to start the bidding. I have two 4s in my hand and a total of 8 digits, which gives me a reasonable base to start with. I will bid 2 4s to establish a low but valid bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 79730320, I have no 4s. Since the current bid is only 2 4s, it's quite plausible that my opponent has two or even more 4s, so challenging now would be risky. To make a higher bid, the minimal legal bid would be 2 5s (same quantity, higher digit). Looking at my hand, I have two 0s and two 3s, which could support future bids on those digits. Strategically, I will increase the digit to 2 7s, since I have two 7s myself. This is a safe, minimal raise leveraging my hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s and two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s. I can increase the quantity to 3 while keeping the digit the same, which seems reasonable since I have enough 7s. Therefore, I will bid 3 7s.

Player 0 bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, so I would need to believe there is at least one more 7 in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. Since 3 7s is plausible and challenging now would be risky, I should make a higher bid. I also have three 0s, so bidding 3 8s or 3 9s would be less supported. Instead, increasing the quantity to 4 for 7s, which is reasonable given my two 7s and a reasonable chance Player 0 has at least two 7s, is a safe incremental bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 7s. To make a valid higher bid, I can bid 5 7s, which is a reasonable increase based on my hand. This also aligns with the previous bids, as I have enough 7s to support this bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 0 bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 7s. The current bid is 5 7s, which means there must be at least two more 7s in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. Since it's somewhat plausible but risky to assume there are two or more 7s in their hand, making the total count 5 or more, it's safer to challenge now rather than push the bid higher into an even less likely territory.
