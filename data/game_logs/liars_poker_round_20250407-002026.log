--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand has two 6s. The current bid is 2 8s. Bidding 3 6s increases the quantity while leveraging my existing 6s. With two 6s in my hand, the opponent only needs one more 6 across their 8 digits to make this bid valid. This maintains pressure while avoiding immediate risk of a challenge.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 4 6s is a safe increase. I don't have enough information to confidently challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s, requiring the opponent to have at least two 6s. Given the low probability of them holding two or more 6s (especially after their aggressive bid progression from 2 8s to 4 6s), challenging seems favorable. If their actual 6 count is less than 2, the bid fails. While they might be bluffing, the risk-reward ratio supports a challenge.
