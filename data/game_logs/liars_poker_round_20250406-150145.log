Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have a 9 in my hand, so bidding 2 9s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that at least one other player has a 9.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand. Since the current bid is only 2 9s, it is quite plausible that among the remaining 16 digits (held by two players), there are at least two 9s. Challenging would be risky at this low bid. The minimal safe move is to raise to a higher digit at the same quantity, such as 2 9s to 2 0s, but 0 is lower than 9. So, the only valid minimal raise is increasing the quantity to 3, choosing a digit I have some of. I have two 8s and two 3s. Bidding 3 3s or 3 8s seems reasonable, as with my two known, only one more is needed among 16 digits. I will bid 3 8s, leveraging my two 8s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. Given that I have one 8 in my hand and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24, I need to assess if bidding higher or challenging is optimal. Since I do not have enough information about other players' hands, I will consider the possibility of higher digits or quantities. However, without a clear advantage in my hand for higher digits, I should consider if challenging could be more beneficial given the current bid's plausibility.
