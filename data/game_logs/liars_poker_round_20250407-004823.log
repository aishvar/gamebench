Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 7. Since there's no current bid, I should start with a conservative bid based on what I know I have. Starting with a digit I have and a low quantity is strategic. I have one 3, so bidding '2 3s' is reasonable - it only requires one more 3 in the opponent's hand, which is fairly likely.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, which allows me to make a higher bid than the current 2 3s. Bidding 2 9s is a valid move since 9 is a higher digit than 3, and I can confidently support this bid with my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I can see my entire hand (36010472) and there are no 9s in it. The opponent bid '2 9s', claiming there are at least 2 nines total. Since I have zero 9s in my hand, this would require the opponent to have at least 2 nines in their hand. While possible, this seems unlikely given they had to respond to my initial bid. I could bid higher, but challenging here has good odds of success since I know my hand has zero 9s.
