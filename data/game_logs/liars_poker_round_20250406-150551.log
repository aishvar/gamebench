Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I can make the first bid. Looking at my hand (18983246), I see that I have one 0, one 1, one 2, two 3s, one 4, one 6, one 8, and one 9. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative and based on the digit distribution in my hand. I have two 3s, so bidding on 3s seems like a good start. The quantity should be at least 2 (since I have two 3s), so bidding '2 3s' is a reasonable and conservative opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one '3'. The current bid is 2 3s, which is plausible since I have one and the opponent likely has at least one as well. Instead of challenging, I can safely increase the bid by raising the digit at the same quantity. Since I have two '7's, bidding 2 7s is a minimal but valid higher bid, which also leverages my hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (since my hand is 18983246 and it contains one 7 and one 8, along with other digits), so it's possible that there are at least two 7s in total. However, I also have a 3 and other digits, but bidding on 3 is not higher than 7. I can either challenge or bid higher. Bidding 3 7s or 2 8s would be a valid higher bid. Since I have an 8, bidding 2 8s seems reasonable as it increases the digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 21079743, I have no 8s at all. The current bid is 2 8s, which requires at least two 8s across all 16 digits. Since I have zero, that would mean the opponent must hold both 8s, which is unlikely but possible. Given the small quantity of 2, it's still plausible and risky to challenge now. Instead, I will raise the bid to 3 of a digit where I have some presence. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 3 7s is a reasonable and safe increase, leveraging my known digits.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 and one 8 in my hand (18983246). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have an 8, I can consider bidding on 8s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid move as it is a higher digit with the same quantity. This seems reasonable given my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 21079743, which contains zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s. Since I have none, all three 8s would have to be in Player 0's hand. This is unlikely, as the probability of one player holding three of the same digit out of eight is low. Therefore, I believe the bid is an overstatement and challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
