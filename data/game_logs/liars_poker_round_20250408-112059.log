Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand (46275809), I have one of each digit (4, 6, 2, 7, 5, 8, 0, 9) and no duplicates. Since this is the first bid, I want to make a conservative but strategic bid. I know for certain there's at least one 9 in play (in my hand). The opponent likely has some distribution of digits, and there's a reasonable chance they might have at least one 9 as well. Starting with a bid of '2 9s' is strategic because: 1) It's based on a high digit (9), which gives me room if the bidding continues, 2) It's a conservative quantity that has a good chance of being true, and 3) It puts pressure on my opponent to either increase the quantity or challenge.
