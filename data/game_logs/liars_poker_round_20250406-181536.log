Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make a valid bid to start the game. Since I have a mix of digits in my hand, I'll choose a digit that appears most frequently. The digit 0 appears once, 2 appears once, 3 appears once, 5 appears once, 6 appears once, 7 appears once, and 9 appears once. So, I'll choose the digit 0, which appears once. A reasonable bid would be to claim at least one 0, which is the minimum quantity.
