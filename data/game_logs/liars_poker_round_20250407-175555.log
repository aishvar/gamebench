Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 65079393, containing one 0, two 3s, one 5, one 6, one 7, and two 9s. The total number of digits across both players is 16. A safe opening bid should be statistically likely and relatively low. I hold two 3s and two 9s. The expected total count for any digit is 1.6 (16 digits / 10 possibilities). Since I hold two 3s, the expected total number of 3s across all hands is 2 (mine) + 0.8 (opponent's expected) = 2.8. Bidding '2 Threes' is therefore a statistically reasonable and credible opening bid. It's stronger than bidding '1' of a digit I only have one of. Choosing '2 Threes' over '2 Nines' is preferable as it's a lower digit, leaving more room for subsequent bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. Looking at my hand (27658825), I do not have any 3s. This means that for the bid of 2 3s to be valid, Player 0 must have at least 2 3s in their hand. Since each player has 8 digits, it is possible but unlikely that Player 0 has exactly 2 or more 3s, especially with no evidence or higher bids to suggest otherwise. Given this, I believe the bid is too high and will challenge it.
