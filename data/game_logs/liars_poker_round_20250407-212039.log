Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Starting with a bid of 3 1s. I have two 1s in my hand (digits 5 and 6). Bidding three gives a reasonable claim that the opponent might have at least one 1. This is a moderate bid that isn't obviously impossible while leaving room for escalation. Common digits like 1 are plausible in random hands, making it harder to challenge immediately.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 ones. Looking at my hand (67753028), I have zero '1's. Since I hold no '1's, for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need to have all 3 or more '1's in their hand of 8 digits. While it's possible, it's statistically unlikely for an opponent to hold 3 or more '1's alone. Given the low probability, it's a good opportunity to challenge the bid rather than risk making an unlikely higher bid.
