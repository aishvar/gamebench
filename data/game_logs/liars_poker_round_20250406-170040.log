Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have two 9s, one 3, one 0, one 2, one 6, and one 4 in my hand. A safe starting bid would be to bid on a digit I have, and a reasonable quantity. I'll bid 2 9s, as I have two 9s in my hand. This is a conservative but valid opening bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 4 9s is a logical next step as it's a direct increase in quantity while keeping the digit the same. It's a reasonable bid given my hand and the previous bids.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 4 9s, which is the same quantity as my last bid. I should aim to increase the quantity or digit to make a valid higher bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Given the recent bidding history focused on 9s and now a switch to 0s, and the relatively high quantity of 5, it's plausible the other player has several 0s. However, increasing the quantity to 6 0s seems reasonable, as it's a small increase and I have a 0. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 3s, but the bid history suggests the other player might be bluffing on 0s. Therefore, I will increase the bid on 0s.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. My hand contains a 0. Considering the bid history, it's likely that the current bid is accurate. However, I should increase the digit to a higher value. I have a 5 in my hand, so bidding 6 5s is a reasonable move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 5S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Given the previous bids focusing on 9s and 0s, and then a sudden jump to 6 5s, it seems risky. While I don't know the other player's hand, bidding higher feels like walking into a challenge. The history shows a pattern of escalating bids, but the sudden change in digit suggests a bluff. I will challenge the bid.
