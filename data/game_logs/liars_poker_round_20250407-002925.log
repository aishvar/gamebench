Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (61416987), I have two 1s and two 6s, which are the highest repeating digits. Bidding 2 6s seems reasonable as it's a safe and valid starting bid.

Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6. The current bid is 2 6s, which is plausible since I have one and the opponent likely has at least one as well. Making a minimal but valid higher bid would be to increase the digit while keeping the quantity, so I can bid 2 7s. Alternatively, increasing the quantity is also valid. Given the early stage and plausible bid, it's safer to increment the digit to 2 7s, maintaining pressure without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 7s. Since I only have one 7, it's unlikely there are two 7s in total. However, I can increase the quantity and digit to make a higher bid. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable, as I have one 8 and it increases both quantity and digit.

Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, which would require at least one more 8 in Player 0's hand. This is plausible, so challenging now would be risky. To make a safe higher bid, I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving from 3 8s to 3 9s. Since I have one 9, it's reasonable that there might be two more 9s combined, making this a credible next bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 9s. Considering the bid history and my hand, it's unlikely there are 3 or more 9s in total. I should challenge the bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
