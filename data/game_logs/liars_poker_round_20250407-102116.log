Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '30719251', I have one '0'. The current bid is 1 0s, which is plausible given my hand alone. Since there are 16 digits total, it's quite likely there is at least one or even more zeros overall. Challenging now would be premature. Instead, I will make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving from 1 0s to 1 1s.
