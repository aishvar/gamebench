Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains digits 1, 7, 2, 6, 8, 4, 8, 5. The digit '8' appears twice in my hand, making it a good candidate for an initial bid. With 16 digits total, it is reasonable to start conservatively. Bidding 3 8s is a safe initial bid, given I already have two 8s myself, and it is likely at least one more exists in the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s. Since I only have one 8, it's unlikely there are three 8s in total. I should challenge the bid to verify the count.
