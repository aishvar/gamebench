Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I don't have any 7s in my hand. The previous bid was 3 6s. I have two 6s. I could bid 4 0s, which is a safe increase. Or I could challenge, since I don't have any 7s. Given the Naive 50/50 player, it's possible they are bluffing. Since the bid is only 3, I will bid slightly higher. I'll bid 4 0s.
