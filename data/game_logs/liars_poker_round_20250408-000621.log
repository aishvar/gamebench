Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 3s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 3s. Since there are only 8 digits in my hand and the opponent's hand is unknown, it's possible that the opponent has at least two 3s. However, the bid is relatively low, so I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Given that I have two 1s and two 5s in my hand, I can make a higher bid based on these digits. Bidding 3 1s is a reasonable increase from 2 3s, as it increases the quantity and is based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid is 3 1s. Bidding 3 3s is a higher bid because 3 is greater than 1, and with my two 3s, there's a good chance the total could meet or exceed three.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s, which means the opponent is claiming there are at least three 3s in total. Given that I only have one, it's unlikely the opponent has two more 3s to meet the bid. Therefore, challenging seems like the best move.
