--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I must make the first bid. My hand has two 1s. Bidding 3 1s increases the quantity from zero and gives a plausible chance if the opponent has at least one 1. It balances risk and potential to set up future bids.

Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand, which means there are at least 3 1s in total (including my opponent's hand). The current bid is 3 1s, so I can either bid higher or challenge. Since I have two 1s, bidding 4 1s seems reasonable, as it increases the quantity based on my hand. However, I also have other digits to consider. Bidding 4 0s is also an option since I have two 0s, which would increase both quantity and potentially the total count if my opponent has 0s. Considering the balance, bidding 4 1s is a safer and more logical move.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. My hand has two 1s. For the bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least two 1s. However, with only 8 digits in their hand, the chance of them having two or more 1s is uncertain. Challenging risks losing if they have exactly two 1s, but there's a chance they have fewer, making the bid invalid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) challenges Player 1's (cohere/command-a:floor) bid of 4 1s.
