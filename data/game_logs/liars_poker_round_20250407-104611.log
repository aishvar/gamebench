--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a safe bid that guarantees at least two 7s total (my own two). This forces the opponent to bid higher or challenge, but challenging would fail as the minimum count is already met.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 0, 9, 5, 8, 8, 0, 3, 1, which means zero 7s. Since the total digits are 16 and the current bid is only 2 7s, it's quite plausible that my opponent has two or more 7s. Therefore, challenging now is risky. To make a legal and safe higher bid, I can bid 2 8s, since I hold two 8s myself, making that bid quite safe for me.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 8S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 and one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s. Since my 8 contributes to the count, Player 1 only needs one more 8 to make their bid valid. Challenging is risky as there might be exactly two 8s total. Instead, I can bid 2 9s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit). While I only have one 9, this forces Player 1 to either bid higher or challenge, buying time while leveraging the uncertainty about their hand composition.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 9S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9 and two 8s. The current bid is 2 9s, which is plausible since I hold one 9, so the opponent could reasonably have one or more. To raise, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, the only legal raise is to increase the quantity to 3 9s. Given I only have one 9, and expecting the opponent to have two 9s out of their eight digits is somewhat risky but not unreasonable. Therefore, I will conservatively raise to 3 8s instead, as I already hold two 8s myself, making it quite likely there are at least three 8s in total.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 8s. Challenging risks losing if the opponent has at least one 8. Bidding 4 4s increases the quantity while leveraging my two 4s, requiring the opponent to have only two 4s to validate the bid. This balances risk and maintains bidding momentum.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 4S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 0, 9, 5, 8, 8, 0, 3, 1. I have zero 4s. The current bid is 4 4s, meaning there must be at least four 4s across both hands. Since I have none, all four would need to be in Player 0's hand. This is quite unlikely because 4 out of 8 digits being 4s is a low probability scenario. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bid of 4 4s.
