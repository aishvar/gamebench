--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. Since the current bid is 2 8s, it is quite plausible there is at least one more 8 in the opponent's hand. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable and safe incremental raise, as it's likely there are at least three 8s in total across both hands. This keeps the pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. To make a valid bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I could bid 3 9s, or 4 of any digit. Since I only have one 8, and the previous bids were on 8s, it's possible my opponent is bluffing. However, it's also possible they have more 8s. To play it safe, I'll bid 4 0s, increasing the quantity and selecting a digit I don't have in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 18693714, I have no 0s at all. For the current bid of 4 0s to be valid, the opponent would need to have all 4 or more 0s in their hand of 8 digits. The probability of 4 or more zeros in one hand is quite low. Given that I have zero and it's unlikely the opponent has 4 or more, challenging is the best move.
