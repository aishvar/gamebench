Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no zeros, making it less likely that there are many zeros overall. Since the current bid is only 1 zero, it's quite plausible that the other player has at least one zero among their 8 digits. Therefore, challenging now would be risky. The minimal valid raise is to keep the quantity at 1 but increase the digit. I will conservatively increase the bid to 1 1s to maintain pressure without overcommitting.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 3, 5, 6. I do not have any 2s, so the current bid of 1 2s relies entirely on Player 0 having at least one 2, which is plausible. Since the bid is very low (just 1), it's risky to challenge because even a naive opponent is likely to have at least one 2 in their 8 digits. Therefore, it's better to make a higher safe bid based on digits I do have. I have two 5s and two 6s. The current bid is 1 2s, so I can outbid by bidding 2 5s, which is a safe, valid next bid leveraging my known hand.
