Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, two 0s, one 5, one 2, one 8, and one 4. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be 2 6s, reflecting the two 6s I hold, which is likely to be a conservative estimate of the total count across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. My hand is 98773029, which contains one 6 (from the digit 6 in my hand). To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 6, and there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's, it's possible there's at least one more 6. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. However, I should also consider bidding on a higher digit to potentially make a safer bet.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, which means there must be at least one more 6 in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. This is plausible, so challenging now is risky. To make a safe higher bid, I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since increasing the digit to 7 with the same quantity (3 7s) might be less safe without knowledge of 7s, a better move is to increase the quantity of 6s to 4, leveraging my two 6s and assuming the opponent could have at least two 6s as well.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 98773029, which contains one 6. The current bid is 4 6s. I have seen one 6 in my hand, and the bid is for a total of 4 6s across both hands. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 6, it's possible the total count of 6s is at least 4 if the other player has at least 3 6s. However, bidding more than 4 6s seems risky as it would require the other player to have more than 3 6s, which is possible but not certain. I can bid 4 7s, which is a higher bid than 4 6s by increasing the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (56284160), I have zero 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, which requires there to be at least four 7s across both hands. Since I have none, Player 1 would need to have all four or more 7s, which is highly improbable given only 8 digits in their hand. Therefore, it's strategically sound to challenge this bid.
