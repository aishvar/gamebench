Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (Random(openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor)), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player, I need to make an initial bid. My hand contains three 1s, which is the highest count among my digits. Bidding 4 ones is a reasonable increment, considering the other player might have at least one 1. This bid balances risk and potential success.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (Random(openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor)), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s. Bidding 4 on 6 is a strategic choice because it's plausible if the opponent also has two 6s. If they have fewer, the bid might still hold, and it sets a moderate bar for the opponent to challenge or increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 20847253. The current bid is '4 6s', meaning the bidder claims there are at least four 6s across all 16 digits (both players' hands). I have zero 6s in my hand. Therefore, for the bid to be true, the other player (Player 0) must hold at least four 6s in their 8-digit hand. The statistical probability of having four or more of a specific digit in an 8-card hand (where each digit is drawn randomly from 0-9) is very low (around 0.5%). Since I possess none of the required digit, the burden falls entirely on the opponent having an exceptionally rare hand distribution for this specific digit. Thus, the bid is highly likely to be false.
