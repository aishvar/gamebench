Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since this is the first bid, starting with a moderate quantity like 3 9s is reasonable. It's likely the opponent has at least one 9, making the total count plausible.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 8 and no 9s in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have any 9s, it's likely that the total count of 9s is less than 3 (one from each player), making the bid potentially challengeable. However, I should consider the possibility that the other player has multiple 9s. Bidding 3 0s is a safe higher bid as it increases the digit. I will bid 3 0s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 8 in my hand and no 9s. Since I don't have any 9s, the total count of 9s is likely to be less than or equal to 8 (the total number of digits in the other player's hand). Thus, bidding 3 8s or higher is reasonable if I had 8s, but I only have one 8. However, I can still make a higher bid by matching the quantity and increasing the digit, but since 9 is the highest digit, I can only increase the quantity. I will bid 4 0s, increasing the quantity and choosing a digit that I have in my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. Since I have no 0s in my hand, the total number of 0s can only come from Player 1's hand. It's unlikely that Player 1 has 4 or more 0s, especially since I have none. Challenging this bid could reveal that the actual count is less than 4, giving me a win.
