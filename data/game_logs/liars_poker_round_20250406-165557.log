Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have two 5s in my hand. A conservative starting bid would be 1 5s. Since I can bid any valid bid, I will start with 1 5s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Bidding 2 5s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit to 6 seems reasonable as I have a 6 in my hand, and it's a valid bid. Bidding 3 5s is also valid but less informative about my hand. Bidding 2 6s would be a valid bid, but 3 5s is a stronger bid given my hand and the previous bids.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 4 5s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity of the digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 5s is a reasonable option. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit, but given the history of bidding on 5s, it seems likely the other player has some as well. Therefore, increasing the quantity on 5s is the most logical next step.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 5 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s, but I have two 5s in my hand. I should increase the quantity to at least 6 5s, making a reasonable bid based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 5S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I have two 5s in my hand. While I could bid higher on 5s, it's risky as I don't have many. I have a 6 in my hand, and bidding 7 6s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity. This is a safer bet than continuing to bid on 5s, given my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 6S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 7 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have a 4 in my hand, which is a higher digit than the current bid's 6. Given the increasing bid history, I should bid a higher quantity of the same digit. However, since I don't have a 6 in my hand, I'll increase the quantity of the next highest digit I have, which is 4. Bidding 8 4s seems like a safe and reasonable move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 4S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 8 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. The previous bids focused on 5s and 6s. Bidding higher on 4s seems risky as I have no information to support that claim. Given the history, and my hand containing a 9, bidding 9 9s is a reasonable attempt to increase the bid significantly, hoping the opponent doesn't have many 9s. It's a higher quantity and digit than the current bid.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 9 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 9s. Analyzing my hand, I have a 3, a 4, and a 6. I have no 9s. Bidding on a digit I have in my hand, like 4 or 6, seems reasonable. However, I also notice that Player 1 bid 8 4s earlier, so I should not bid on 4. I will bid on 6.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 9s. I have 2 9s in my hand. Bidding 10 9s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 10 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. It's unlikely there are 10 or more 9s in total between both hands. While I could bid higher, challenging seems more strategic given the high quantity and my limited knowledge of the opponent's hand. Bidding higher would be a bluff with little support from my hand.
