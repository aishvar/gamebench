Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and need to make the first bid. My hand is 92830320. I have two 0s, two 2s, and two 3s. The expected number of any digit across all 16 digits is 1.6. Having two 0s makes bidding on 0s a good starting point. Bidding '3 0s' is a reasonable opening bid, as it requires only one 0 from the opponent's hand, which is statistically likely. It's a relatively safe bid that also leaves room for future increases.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 0s. It is plausible that Player 0 has at least two 0s in their hand, making their bid reasonable. Instead of challenging, I should make a higher bid. I also have two 4s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid 4 4s, increasing both the quantity and digit compared to the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. My hand (92830320) contains zero 4s. For the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 1) must have at least four 4s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, holding four or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is statistically less likely than holding fewer. Given I have none of the bid digit, the probability of the bid being false seems high enough to warrant a challenge.
