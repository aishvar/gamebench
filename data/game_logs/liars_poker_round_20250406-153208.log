Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 90131459, which contains two 9s, one 1, two 4s, and one 5. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. I have a total of 8 digits, and the most frequent digit in my hand is 4 and 9 (both appearing twice). I will bid on a digit that I have, starting with a quantity of 2. Bidding '2 4s' or '2 9s' seems reasonable. I'll choose '2 4s' as my first bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 20625901, I have zero 4s. Since the total digits are 16 and I have no 4s, the opponent must have at least 2 4s for their bid to be valid. Statistically, the average count per digit across 16 digits is about 1.6, so 2 4s is plausible. Challenging now would be risky. Instead, I can make a safe higher bid based on my hand. I have two 0s, so bidding 3 0s (increasing quantity and switching digit) is reasonable, as it's likely there is at least one 0 in the opponent's hand to meet or exceed the bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have a lot of high digits, I'll try to make a reasonable increase in quantity or digit. I see that I have a few higher digits, so bidding 3 1s seems like a reasonable move as it increases the digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 20625901, I have two 0s and two 1s. The current bid is 3 1s, and since I already hold two 1s, it's plausible there is at least one more 1 in the opponent's hand, making the bid reasonable. To raise, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and bid a higher digit. I have two 0s, so bidding 3 2s or 3 5s (digits I have) is riskier, but raising the quantity to 4 0s leverages my two 0s and forces the opponent to have at least two more 0s. Alternatively, bidding 4 1s requires there to be at least two more 1s in their hand, which is less likely. Given my two 0s, a bid of 4 0s is a reasonable strategic raise.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have the hand 90131459, which contains one 0. The total count of 0s across both hands must be at least 4 for the current bid to be valid. Given that I have one 0, my opponent must have at least 3 0s. While possible, it's a bit aggressive. However, I can bid higher. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about my opponent's hand, I'll play it safe and bid on a digit that I have more information about. I have two 9s, so bidding on 9s seems reasonable. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid because it has the same quantity but a higher digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '20625901', I have zero 9s. Since there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's, the maximum total 9s possible is 16. However, given that I have none, the opponent would need to have all 4 or more 9s for their bid of 4 9s to be valid. Statistically, it is unlikely they hold 4 or more 9s out of their 8 digits, especially given that I have none. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move.
