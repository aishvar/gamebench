Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 3, one 4, one 7, one 9, one 6, one 5, one 8, and one 2 â€” no duplicates. The safest opening bid is the minimum possible, which is 1 of any digit. Choosing a mid-range digit like 5 is reasonable to avoid revealing too much about my hand and to keep future options flexible.
