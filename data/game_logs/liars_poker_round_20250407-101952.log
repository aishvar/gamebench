Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 3s, two 8s, one 6, one 5, one 2, and one 0. The current bid is only 1 zero, and since I hold one zero myself, it's very likely there is at least one more zero between both hands. Therefore, challenging now would be unwise. The next minimum valid bid must be either 2 0s or 1 1s. Given I don't have any 1s, a safe incremental bid is 2 0s, supported by my hand containing one zero.
