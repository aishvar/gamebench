Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that there are no bids yet, I should start with a reasonable bid. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s seems a good starting point, increasing the quantity compared to the current 'None' bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider my hand and the possibility of having a higher quantity or digit. My hand contains the digits: 9, 1, 6, 7, 0, 3, 3, 4, 9. I have two 3s and two 9s, but no 8s. A reasonable bid seems to be 4 9s because I have two 9s and it's a higher digit than 8, and also increases the quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Given the current bid is already quite high, and I have only two 9s, it's unlikely I can make a higher quantity bid. However, I can try to increase the digit, as my highest digit is 8. But since I have 9s, I should focus on increasing the digit to a higher value than 9, which I don't have, so I should increase the digit to 8, which is the highest digit I have.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 8 in my hand. The current bid is 4 9s. Bidding 5 8s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 9, 1, 6, 7, 0, 3, 4, 9, and 4. I see two 9s and one 4 and two 6s and one 7 and one 0 and one 3. The bid of 5 8s seems high but I do not have enough information about Player 0's hand. However, I do have two 9s and my digit 9 is higher than 8. I will increase the quantity and keep the digit higher than 8, or increase the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 7 9s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 7 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 16 digits in total between both players, I should assess if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. Since the bid is already at 7 9s and I only have one 9, challenging seems risky but could be viable if I think the bid is unlikely. However, I can also try to bid higher with a reasonable chance of having more digits than the current bid quantity suggests.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 8 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 0s. Considering my hand, I have two 0s. Player 1 has bid 8 0s, which I think is unlikely. I should challenge.
