Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 60423406, which contains two 0s, one 2, one 3, one 4, and two 6s. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. I have two 6s, which is a relatively high count for a single digit. I will bid 3 6s, increasing the quantity slightly from my own count to account for the possibility that the other player might also have a 6.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. The current bid seems low, so I should assess my hand for potential digits to bid on. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding a higher quantity or digit seems feasible. Increasing the quantity to 4 and keeping the digit as 6 seems reasonable given my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (60423406), so I know there are at least two 6s. The total count of 6s could be between 2 and 8 (since the other player also has 8 digits). Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, making it a valid higher bid. I should bid 4 7s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my hand is 01838596, I have a total of 3 sevens (none), and 4 sixes, 3 fives, 2 threes, 2 eights, 1 nine, 1 zero, 1 one, 1 six and 1 four. Given that I have 2 sevens are not present but 3 sixes and other digits, I can safely assume I don't have enough sevens to challenge or make a significantly higher bid on 7s. However, I can try to make a bid using my available digits. I see that I have 3 sixes which could potentially be used to make a higher bid than 4 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, so I must bid higher than 4 or higher than 7 if the quantity is the same. I can bid 5 6s, increasing both the quantity and digit.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. My hand is 60423406, which contains two 6s. I need to either make a higher bid or challenge. Since I have two 6s and there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's, it's possible that there are more than 5 6s in total. However, I can bid higher than 5 6s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I can bid 5 7s or 6 0s, for example. Given that I have a 6 and a 0, and no 7s, bidding 5 7s seems like a reasonable move as it increases the digit and keeps the quantity the same.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I need to make a higher bid. Since my hand is 01838596, I have a total of 3 sevens (none) and 4 sixes (none), but I do have 3 sevens aren't present, I have 1 seven. I should consider what I can reasonably bid. Given that I have no 7s and 3 sixes aren't present but 3 sixes aren't there either, bidding higher on a different digit seems reasonable. My hand contains 3 sixes which isn't a lot but I do have 2 eights and other digits. I can see if I raise the quantity or digit slightly. The bid of 5 7s seems high but I do not have much information.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 0s

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have two 0s in my hand, so I know there are at least 2 0s. Player 1 has bid on 0s, suggesting they might have some. However, bidding 7 0s or higher seems too aggressive given the quantity. I should consider bidding on a higher digit instead. Bidding 6 1s is a valid move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit. However, I should assess the likelihood of the bid being true. Since I have one 6 and no 7s or higher, and the previous bids were around 6s and 7s, it seems plausible that there are enough higher digits. I'll bid 6 1s as it's a reasonable and safe increase.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains 2 1s, 1 3, 1 5, 1 6, 1 8, and 3 other digits. Given that the bid is 6 1s, I must assess if there's a high likelihood of more than 6 1s in total. Since I only have 2 1s and the opponent also has 8 digits, it's possible they have more 1s. However, bidding higher seems risky without more information. I should consider if challenging could be more beneficial or if I can safely make a higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 2S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 2s. My hand is 60423406, which contains one 2. To determine the likelihood of the bid being true, I need to consider the total count of 2s. Since there are 16 digits in total and I have one 2, there are 8 digits left in the opponent's hand. The bid implies that there are at least 7 twos in total. I have one, so that leaves 6 twos to be distributed among the opponent's 8 digits. While it's possible, it's a relatively high quantity. However, considering the history of bids and the fact that my opponent made this bid, it's likely they have a good reason. I should consider bidding higher or challenging. The next possible bid would be 7 3s or 8 0s/1s/2s. Since I'm not confident in challenging and the bid isn't extremely high, I'll bid 8 0s, increasing the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 0s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that this bid is valid. Given that my hand contains a 0, and I know there are 8 secret digits for each player, I should consider if there's a possibility that there are indeed 8 or more 0s in total. Since I have one 0 and the opponent has made a bid of 8 0s, which seems high but not impossible, I should consider if challenging could be more beneficial or if I can make a higher bid. My hand does not seem to have enough high digits to make a significantly higher bid than 8 0s without risking a challenge that could backfire.
