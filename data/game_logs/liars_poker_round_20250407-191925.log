Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the game state, the current bid is 'None', and there are no previous bids. The most likely first bid would be a high digit with a moderate quantity. Since my hand contains multiple digits, I should start by bidding on a digit that appears frequently in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (39478674), I have two 8s. The current bid is 5 8s, meaning there must be at least 5 eights across both hands. Since I hold 2, the other player would need at least 3 eights for the bid to be valid. This is somewhat unlikely given the distribution of digits in 8 random digits, as 3 or more 8s in one hand is rare. Therefore, the bid is probably an overestimate, making it a good spot to challenge.
