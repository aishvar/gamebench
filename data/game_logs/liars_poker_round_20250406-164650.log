Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 3, 1, 0, 5, 2 in my hand. The current bid is None. I should start with a bid that covers at least one digit with a reasonable quantity. I notice I have multiple 5s, so I'll bid on that.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 6, 8, 9, 5, 1, 2, 8, 7, which includes one 5. Since the total number of digits is 16 and I only have one 5, the opponent would need to have at least two 5s for the current bid of 3 5s to hold. This is plausible, but not certain. Rather than challenging now, a safer strategy is to increase the bid slightly, ideally on a digit I have more of. I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s is lateral, not higher. To make a valid higher bid, I can bid 3 6s (same quantity, higher digit), since I have one 6, or better yet, 4 8s (higher quantity, digit I have two of), which is a reasonable escalation based on my hand. This pressures my opponent and leverages my known digits.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 5 8s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 8s (digits: 6,8,9,5,1,2,8,7), which is a strong indication that there are likely fewer than 5 total 8s across both hands. For the opponent's bid of 5 8s to be valid, they would need to have at least 2 more 8s in their hand. Given the distribution, it is statistically improbable that they have 2 or more 8s, making their bid unlikely. Therefore, the best move is to challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
