Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid of 2 9s is safe because I know at least two 9s exist (my own). This establishes a high-digit starting point, forcing the opponent to increase quantity or challenge a truthful claim.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s. Since the total digits are 16, and I hold 8 of them, the likelihood that the opponent has at least two 9s is plausible but not certain. However, the bid is relatively low (2 9s), so challenging now is risky. I will make a safe incremental bid by increasing the quantity to 3 and choosing a digit I have multiple of. I have two 2s and two 1s, so bidding 3 2s would be reasonable, as it's plausible the opponent has at least one 2, making the total at least three.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 2s in my hand. The opponent bid 3 2s, which would require them to have all three 2s in their 8-card hand. Given the low probability of holding three of one digit in an 8-card hand (approximately 3.8% chance) and the strategic risk of bidding further with uncertain information, challenging is statistically favorable.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) challenges Player 1's (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bid of 3 2s.
