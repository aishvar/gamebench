Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have two 5s and one 8 in my hand. Bidding 2 5s is a reasonable move as it increases the quantity and digit from the current bid. It's also likely that the other player has at least one 5, making this a plausible bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 5s and two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s. Since I have three 5s, I can make a bid of 3 5s, which is a valid higher bid than 2 6s. I could also bid 2 7s, but 3 5s is a stronger bid because it increases both the quantity and the digit.
