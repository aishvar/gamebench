Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 95637307, I have two 3s and two 7s, which are the most frequent digits. A conservative opening bid is 2 7s or 2 3s. To avoid giving away too much information and to start with a reasonable bid, I'll open with 2 7s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. My hand has two 8s. Bidding 2 8s is a valid higher bid since 8 is higher than 7. This leverages my own 8s, making the total count at least 2, which matches the bid's quantity but with a higher digit. Challenging risks losing if the opponent has two 7s, so raising the bid is safer.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 95637307, I have zero 8s, so the current bid of 2 8s relies entirely on Player 1's hand. Since it's plausible they have two 8s, a challenge is risky. To outbid, I can increase the quantity or digit. I have two 7s, so bidding 3 7s is reasonable, as with my two 7s and the opponent's unknown hand, three total 7s is quite likely.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit). I have two 8s in my hand, so there's a chance the total is at least three if the opponent has at least one 8. This avoids challenging and shifts the pressure back to the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 95637307, I have the digits: 9, 5, 6, 3, 7, 3, 0, 7. I have zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, meaning at least 3 eights across both hands. Since I hold none, the opponent would need to have all 3 or more 8s in their hand of 8 digits. The probability of that is quite low, as having 3 or more of the same digit in 8 digits is uncommon. Given this low likelihood and my zero 8s, challenging is the best move.
