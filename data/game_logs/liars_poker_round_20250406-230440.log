Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 37376089, I notice I have two 3s and other digits. Since I have to make a bid that is strictly higher than 'None', I'll start with a low quantity and a digit I have multiple of, to minimize risk. Bidding on the digit '3' seems reasonable because I have two of them, and it's a relatively low digit, making it easier to have at least one more '3' in the other player's hand.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 3s in my hand, meaning Player 0 must have all 3 required 3s themselves. The probability of a player holding at least three 3s in an 8-card hand is low (~3% in random distribution). Since this is a high-risk bid for Player 0 given the odds, challenging is statistically favorable.
