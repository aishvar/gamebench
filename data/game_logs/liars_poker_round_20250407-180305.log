Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player to bid, I need to establish an opening bid. My hand is 80727986. I have two 8s and two 7s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. There are 16 total digits in play (2 players * 8 digits). Statistically, each digit appears 1.6 times on average across all hands. A reasonable opening bid often involves the count of a frequent digit in one's hand, potentially increased by one to account for the opponent's likely holdings. I have two 8s. Bidding '3 8s' is plausible, as it only requires the opponent to have at least one 8 among their 8 digits. Bidding on 8s (a higher digit) is strategically slightly better than bidding on 7s for the same quantity, as it restricts the opponent's next available bids more. Therefore, '3 8s' is a solid opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 49122147. The current bid is '3 8s' made by Player 0. I have zero 8s in my hand. For the bid to be true, Player 0 must have at least three 8s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, requiring 3 specific digits out of 8 for an opening bid seems somewhat unlikely, especially since I hold none of that digit. Challenging the bid seems like a strong option, as Player 0 bears the entire burden of possessing those three 8s. Making a higher bid, like '3 9s' (I have one 9) or '4 1s' (I have two 1s), is possible but less direct. Bidding '3 9s' requires Player 0 to have two 9s, which is plausible. Bidding '4 1s' requires Player 0 to have two 1s, also plausible, but escalates the quantity quickly. Given I have no 8s, challenging the claim of three 8s total feels like the most strategically sound move.
