Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have eight digits in my hand with two 8s, which is one of my stronger counts. Since there is no current bid, a modest opening bid supported by my hand is a safe start. Bidding '2 8s' is reasonable given that it aligns with my holdings and leaves room to escalate later.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. Given that the current bid is quite low, I should assess my hand for potential digits to bid on. I have a 6 and a few other digits, but no 8s. A reasonable next bid could be higher than 2 8s. I see I have a 6 and a 9, so bidding 3 9s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit.
