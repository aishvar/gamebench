Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 0s, two 3s, and one 2 and one 4. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be 2 of a digit I have multiple of. I'll bid 2 9s, reflecting my hand and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s and two 0s. The current bid is 3 0s. Since I already hold two 0s, it's quite plausible that there is at least one more 0 in Player 1's hand, making the total at least 3. Therefore, challenging would be risky. I can instead safely raise the bid by matching the quantity of 3 but choosing a higher digit where I have strong holdings. I have two 9s, and the previous bid on 9s was only 2. So, increasing the bid to 3 9s is a valid, higher bid and is supported by my hand.
