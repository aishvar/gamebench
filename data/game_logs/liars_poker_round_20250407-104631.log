--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 8s, one 3, one 9, one 7, and one 6. The most frequent digits in my hand are 1s and 8s, each appearing twice. To open conservatively yet assertively, I will bid 2 8s, reflecting my hand's strength and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 2 9s, which is plausible since the opponent could have one or even two 9s. Since I have only one 9, it's risky to challenge at this low bid. To maintain pressure and avoid an early challenge, I will make a minimal higher bid by increasing the quantity to 3 but choosing a digit I have strong presence in. I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s is a reasonable next move, likely to be true or difficult for the opponent to challenge confidently.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 8s and one 9. The current bid is 3 9s. Since I only have one 9, for the bid to be valid Player 1 would need at least two 9s, which is possible but somewhat unlikely given the distribution. However, since 3 9s is quite plausible, directly challenging now may be risky. Instead, I can safely increase the bid by quantity to 4 8s, as I have two 8s myself, so only two more are needed from Player 1's hand, which is reasonable. This also increases the quantity, making it a valid higher bid.
