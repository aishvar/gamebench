Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one each of 0,1,3,3,4,5,6,8. Since this is the first bid and I want to bid based on what I know for certain, I'll bid based on having two 3s in my hand. Starting with a moderate bid of '2 3s' is strategic as it leaves room for higher bids while being backed by my actual hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand (94592198) contains one '9' digit appearing twice, and single occurrences of digits 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8. I have no '3' digits. The current bid is '2 3s', which seems low and plausible since there are 16 digits in total. Without any '3's in my own hand, I cannot confidently challenge this bid. To safely increase the bid, I should choose a digit I have multiple occurrences of. I have two '9's, making '2 9s' a safe bid, but I must bid higher than '2 3s'. Since bidding the same quantity but a higher digit is allowed, bidding '2 9s' is valid and safe based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 34365081, I don't see any 9s. The opponent bid '2 9s', and I know there are 8 digits in each player's hand (16 total). While it's possible they have 2 or more 9s in their hand, I do have 3 occurrences of the digit 3 in my hand (position 0, 2, and 4). Since I'm confident there are at least 3 threes total (having them all in my hand), I can safely bid '3 3s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand (94592198) contains only one '9' and one '3'. The current bid is '3 3s', meaning the opponent believes there are at least three '3s' in total. I have only one '3'. It is plausible that the opponent has at least two '3s' in their hand, making the bid reasonable. However, I have two '9s' in my hand, making a bid of '3 9s' relatively safe and higher than the current bid. Therefore, bidding '3 9s' is a logical next move based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I can see my entire hand (34365081) and there are no 9s in it. The opponent has bid '3 9s', claiming there are at least 3 nines total. Since I have zero 9s in my hand, this would mean they need to have at least 3 nines in their 8 digits, which is possible but quite unlikely. Given this is a relatively early stage bid and they've shown a pattern of preferring 9s, they may be bluffing. A challenge seems safer than raising to a higher bid.
