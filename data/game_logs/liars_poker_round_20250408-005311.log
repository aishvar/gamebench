Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a small opening bid based on my hand. I have three 8s, so bidding 3 8s is a safe starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 42396019, I have zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, which means my opponent is claiming there are at least three 8s total among the 16 digits. Since I have none, all three would need to be in their hand, which is somewhat unlikely given the average expectation is around 1.6 occurrences per digit (16 digits / 10). Without any 8s myself, I think it's risky to raise, and the probability they alone have 3 or more 8s is low, so challenging is the best move.
