Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 28234559, which contains two 2s, one 8, one 5, one 9, and one 3, one 4, and one 5. I have a total of two 5s and other scattered digits. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. I have two 5s, so bidding on 5s with a quantity slightly higher than what I have seems reasonable. I'll bid 3 5s, as it's a safe starting point and slightly higher than my own count.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 6, 5, 0, 7, 1, 8, 9, 6. I count one 5 and two 6s. The current bid is 3 5s, and since I only have one 5, for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least two 5s, which is plausible but not guaranteed. However, I have two 6s, so a bid of 3 6s is at least as plausible as the current bid, and it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This is a safe and strategic higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (from 28234559). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have two 8s and one 9, and no 7s, bidding 3 8s seems like a reasonable move as it increases the digit and is based on my hand's information.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. The current bid is 3 8s, meaning there must be at least two 8s in Player 0's hand to make the bid valid. Since each player only has 8 digits, having a total of 3 or more 8s is somewhat plausible but not guaranteed. Given that Player 0 increased the digit from 6 to 8 without increasing the quantity, they may be bluffing or have at most two 8s. The probability of there being three or more 8s overall is moderate but not high. Since I only have one 8, I think challenging here is a reasonable risk rather than making a higher, riskier bid.
