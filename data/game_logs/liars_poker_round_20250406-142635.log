Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without directly challenging. I have two 6s and two 8s in my hand. A bid of '2 8s' seems reasonable as a starting point, given that I have two 8s and it's a low quantity to begin with.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. Given that the current bid is 2 8s, it's possible that other players have at least one more 8 to make the bid valid. However, increasing the bid to 3 8s might be risky since I don't have strong evidence of additional 8s in other players' hands. Alternatively, I can choose to bid a higher digit that I have more of, such as 0 or 2. I have two 0s and two 2s in my hand, so bidding 3 0s or 3 2s could be a safer move, increasing the quantity while changing to a digit I'm more confident about.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s, two 8s, one 2, one 6, one 3, and one additional 7, totaling three 7s and two 8s. The current bid is 3 0s, which is relatively low. Since I have no 0s, I cannot assess the likelihood of the current bid, but statistically, 3 zeros among 32 digits is plausible. A safe and strategic move is to increase the bid to 3 7s, as I alone have three 7s, making this bid certainly true and strictly higher by digit value without increasing quantity.

--- Turn: Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. My hand is 39168395, which contains one 7. I have to make a bid that is higher than 3 7s. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 7, it's plausible that there are at least 3 7s in total. However, bidding more than 3 7s requires me to believe there's a higher count or a higher digit. I see that I can bid 3 8s, which is a higher digit than 7. Given that my hand has one 8, it's reasonable to assume there could be at least 3 8s across all hands, but I should be cautious. I'll choose to bid 3 8s as it's a relatively safe increase in the digit.

Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 8s in my hand, and given that there are 8 secret digits per player, it's possible that other players have more 8s. However, bidding higher seems risky without knowing the exact distribution of digits. I should consider the possibility that other players might have more 8s, but I also have a relatively high number of 8s. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. The current bid is already at 3 8s, so I should think about bidding higher than 3 or bidding the same quantity with a higher digit. I have 0 9s, so bidding 9s seems less optimal. However, I can try to increase the quantity or digit slightly. Bidding 4 0s seems reasonable as it's a higher quantity than 3 and there might be several 0s in play given their prevalence in digit sets.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand (70032062). The current bid is 4 0s, which is already high but possible given the distribution. Since I have two 0s, it's plausible that other players have at least two more, making the total at least 4. To stay safe, I'll increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving to a higher digit that I also have in my hand (7).
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 7s (digits: 7, 2, 7, 8, 6, 3, 7, 8). The current bid is 4 7s. Since I personally hold three 7s, only one more 7 among the remaining 24 digits would satisfy the current bid, which is quite plausible. Therefore, challenging now is risky. A safe and strategic move is to increase the bid to 4 8s, as I also have two 8s, making that bid credible and raising the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

--- Turn: Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand is 39168395, which contains two 8s. This means there are at least 2 8s in my hand. The total count of 8s across all players is at least 2 (mine) plus the count in other players' hands. Given that the current bid is 4 8s, it's possible that the total count is indeed 4 or more. However, I can bid higher by increasing the digit. I will bid 4 9s, as it's a higher bid and I have one 9 in my hand, making it somewhat plausible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid can be beaten. My hand contains 0, 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 8, 8. I have three 8s, which could potentially be used to increase the bid quantity or digit. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 8 players' digits in play, I should consider if there's a high likelihood that 4 9s can be beaten or if I should challenge. Since I have three 8s and my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider bidding higher than 4 9s. The highest digit I have is 8, and I can see if bidding 5 8s is reasonable given my hand and the goal to outbid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 5 8s, which seems high given that there are only 32 digits in total and the bidding has escalated quickly. The probability that there are at least 5 8s across all players is uncertain, but challenging now might be premature since the bid is not extremely high. A safer move would be to bid 5 9s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, based on the fact that 9 is a higher digit than 8 and I have no 9s in my hand, but others might.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 9S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 5 9s

--- Turn: Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains two 7s, two 8s, one 6, one 2, one 3, and one 7. Specifically, I have zero 9s. The current bid is 5 9s, which requires there to be at least five 9s among all 32 digits. Since I hold none, that leaves all five or more 9s to be distributed among the other 24 digits in the opponents' hands. Statistically, the expected count of any digit in 24 digits is about 2.4, making five 9s unlikely. Given the previous bids focused heavily on 7s and 8s, and no indication of many 9s, I believe the bid is overreaching. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move.
