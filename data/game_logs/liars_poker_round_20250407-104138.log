Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. However, it's very early in the game, and it's likely that there are at least two 0s in total across both hands. I'll bid slightly higher to avoid an early challenge and gather more information. I will bid 2 0s.
