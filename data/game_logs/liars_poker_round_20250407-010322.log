Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. My hand is 18955360. I have two 5s, which is the highest frequency digit in my hand. With 16 total digits in play (8 for me, 8 for the opponent), the expected number of 5s in the opponent's hand is 0.8. Bidding '3 5s' is a reasonable opening bid, as it leverages my strongest digit count and relies on the opponent having at least one 5, which is statistically probable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. My hand contains one 5, and I have no information about the other player's hand. Challenging this bid is a strategic choice because it could reveal that the total number of 5s is less than 3, which would make me the winner.
