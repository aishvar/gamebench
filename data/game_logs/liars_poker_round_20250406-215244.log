Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to start the bidding. I have two 0s, one 1, and one 2 in my hand. A reasonable opening bid would be 2 0s, as it is a digit I have in hand and allows me to establish a presence in the game.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (38026683), I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is '2 0s', meaning the opponent is claiming there are at least 2 zeros total between our hands. Since I have 1 zero, this means the opponent only needs to have 1 zero for their bid to be valid, which is quite reasonable. I could challenge, but it's likely they have at least 1 zero. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have two 6s and two 8s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on either of these digits. I'll bid '2 6s', keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit value, which constitutes a valid higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which means the current bid of 2 6s is plausible. However, I can increase the bid to 3 6s, which is a valid higher bid. This allows me to leverage my hand while still being reasonable in my estimation of the total count of 6s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand (the 5th and 8th digits). The current bid is 3 6s, which means my opponent is claiming there are at least 3 sixes total between our hands. Since I have 2 sixes, this means they're claiming to have at least 1 six in their hand. This is quite possible, so challenging would be risky. I should make a higher bid. I could bid 4 6s, but I don't have enough 6s to support that confidently. Looking at my other digits, I have two 3s and two 8s. I'll bid 3 8s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value, which is a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, and the current bid of 3 8s seems high considering I only have 8 digits in total. It's reasonable to challenge this bid as it seems unlikely that there are 3 8s among both hands.
