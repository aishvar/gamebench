--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 5s, two 9s, one 6, and one 2. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s or 2 9s, as I hold two copies of each. To slightly pressure my opponent and start conservatively, I will open with 2 5s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 and two 3s in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s. Bidding 3 3s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (60275950), I have no 3s, so the current bid of 3 3s relies entirely on my opponent holding at least 3 of that digit, which is unlikely. Since I have two 5s, a safer and stronger bid would be to increase the quantity to 3 but with a higher digit—specifically, 3 5s—making it a valid higher bid while leveraging my hand's strength.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. Since I have no 5s, it's unlikely that there are 3 5s in total. Challenging seems like the best move.
