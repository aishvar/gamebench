Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. My hand is 78431035. I have two 3s, which is the highest frequency of any digit in my hand. There are 16 digits in total (2 players * 8 digits). Bidding '2 Threes' is a safe opening bid because I possess two 3s myself, guaranteeing the total count is at least two, regardless of the opponent's hand. This establishes a reasonable starting point based on my own cards.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 3s'. My hand is 69261964, which contains zero 3s. However, the bid is very low (only 2), making a challenge potentially risky if the opponent holds two 3s. My hand contains three 6s. Bidding '3 6s' is a safe, truthful bid as I hold all three required 6s myself. This bid is higher than '2 3s' (it increases the quantity from 2 to 3) and leverages the strength of my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 78431035. The current bid is '3 6s', made by Player 1. I have zero 6s in my hand. For the bid to be true, Player 1 must have at least three 6s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having three or more of a specific digit (like 6) in an 8-digit hand is statistically low (around 3.8% calculated using binomial probability). Since I hold none of the bid digit, the entire quantity must be in the opponent's hand, making the bid highly unlikely. My previous bid was '2 3s', which was based on the two 3s in my hand. Player 1's jump to '3 6s' seems aggressive and potentially a bluff, especially since it requires a relatively high concentration of a single digit in their hand alone. While I could bid higher, for example '4 3s' (I have two 3s, needing two from the opponent - ~18.7% probability) or '3 7s'/'3 8s' (I have one, needing two from opponent - ~18.7% probability), challenging the current unlikely bid seems like the strongest statistical play.
