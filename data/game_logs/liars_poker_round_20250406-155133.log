Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have two 6s in my hand. A conservative starting bid of 1 6s is reasonable, as it's based on cards I know exist. It's a low risk bid to start the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. Since the current bid is only 1 6s, which accounts for my own 6, it's very likely true or even conservative. Challenging now would almost certainly lose. To outbid, I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity, so I'll bid 1 7s because I also have one 7, making it plausible.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 1 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. My previous bid was 1 6s. I can either bid 2 6s, 1 8s, or 1 9s. Bidding 2 6s is a safe option since I have two 6s. Bidding 1 8s or 1 9s is riskier since I only have one 8 and one 9. Given my hand, increasing the quantity of a digit I have is the most logical approach. Therefore, I will bid 2 6s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 3, 6, 1, 5, 9, 7, 9, 4. I possess exactly one 6. The current bid is 2 6s, which is quite plausible since I have one, and the opponent likely has at least one or might be bluffing. To continue the game strategically and avoid a premature challenge, I can raise the bid slightly by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Since I also have two 9s, a reasonable next bid would be 2 9s, which is a valid strictly higher bid (same quantity, higher digit).

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and it's plausible given I have one myself. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit, but 9s seems like the most logical choice to continue the bidding war. Bidding 3 9s is higher than the current bid and doesn't feel overly risky.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, meaning across both hands there must be at least three 9s. Since I already hold two, it would only require my opponent to have at least one 9 for the bid to be valid, which is plausible. Making a minimal higher bid by increasing the quantity to 4 9s is risky unless I hold more 9s. Alternatively, I could increase the digit with the same quantity. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s as well, so bidding 3 7s is not higher. I also have two 4s, which is insufficient. I have one 5, one 6, and one 3, so no better bid there. The best strategic move is to bid 3 9s -> 4 6s, since I have one 6, and it's plausible that there are three more 6s in total, as 6s are common. This raises the quantity and changes the digit, making it a valid and reasonable higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. The previous bids show a pattern of escalating bids, and the opponent seems confident. I can increase the quantity to 5 6s, which is a reasonable bid given my hand and the history. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit, but 6s seems strategically sound since the opponent has already shown interest in it. Increasing the quantity is the safest option.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (36159794), I have the digits 3, 6, 1, 5, 9, 7, 9, 4. Counting 6s, I have exactly one. For the current bid of 5 6s to be valid, the opponent would need at least 4 more 6s, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. Statistically, having 5 or more of any specific digit across 16 digits is already improbable, especially since I only have one. Therefore, I suspect the opponent is bluffing or overestimating, and challenging is the best move.
