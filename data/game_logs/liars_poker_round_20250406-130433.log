Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two 3s in my hand, I can start with a conservative bid based on my own hand. Starting with a bid of 2 3s seems reasonable as it reflects the count in my hand and leaves room for other players to bid higher.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 38684750, which contains one 3. I can see that there are at least 3 digits in total across all hands (my hand has 1, and the bid is for at least 2 more). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have an 8 in my hand, bidding 2 8s is a valid higher bid because it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. Bidding higher than 2 8s is risky without knowing the other players' hands. Given the previous bid of 2 3s, and the current 2 8s, it seems unlikely there are many 8s. I will challenge the bid, as it's a relatively low quantity and I have no 8s myself, making it more likely to be a lie.
