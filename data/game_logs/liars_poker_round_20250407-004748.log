Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. Starting with a bid on a digit I have multiple of increases the likelihood of success. Bidding 3 1s is reasonable, as there's a chance the opponent has at least one 1, bringing the total to 3 or more.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand, which means the total count of 1s across both hands is at least 3 (since Player 0 bid 3 1s and I have 2). To make a valid higher bid, I can increase the quantity to 4 1s, as it's likely there are at least 4 1s in total given the current information.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 4 4s increases the digit while keeping the same quantity, making it a valid higher bid. If the opponent has at least two 4s, the total would reach four or more, supporting the bid. This avoids challenging, which could lose if the opponent has two 1s.

Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, which are higher than the current bid of 4 4s. Since I can increase both the quantity and the digit, bidding 5 8s seems like a strong move based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have no 8s in my hand (digits: 9,1,2,4,6,1,4,7). To challenge, if the opponent has fewer than 5 8s, I win. Since the bid increased from 4 4s to 5 8s abruptly, it might be a bluff. Challenging is riskier but plausible.
