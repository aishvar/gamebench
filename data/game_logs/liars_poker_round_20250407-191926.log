--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, I have a total of 3 '1's. However, I don't know the contents of the other player's hand. To make a safe bid, I'll choose a digit that appears at least once in my hand but is not too high in quantity, considering the maximum possible quantity is 16. I'll choose the digit '1' because it's present in my hand, and bidding on a lower quantity gives me a higher chance of being correct.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 ones. Looking at my hand (4, 3, 2, 5, 3, 5, 8, 4), I have zero 1s. This means all three 1s must be in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid, which is unlikely since the probability of having exactly three 1s in eight digits is relatively low. Therefore, challenging is statistically favorable here rather than making a higher bid.
