Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening bid and there is no risk of being challenged immediately, I want to start with a reasonable but modest bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 9s, one 7, one 6, one 8, and one 5. The most frequent digits in my hand are 0 and 9, each appearing twice. Statistically, I can expect the opponent to have roughly 1-2 of any digit, so starting with a conservative bid of 3 0s, leveraging my two 0s, is a safe and strategic opening.
