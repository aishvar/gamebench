Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 66836108, I have two 6s which is the highest frequency of any digit. Since this is the first bid and I want to start strategically, I'll bid two 6s. This is a conservative opening bid that I know exists just from my hand, while leaving room for higher bids later. Starting with a medium-strength bid is better than revealing too much information with a very low or very high bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 38777944. The current bid is '2 6s' made by Player 0. I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid.
1. My hand contains zero 6s. For the current bid '2 6s' to be true, Player 0 must hold at least two 6s in their 8-digit hand. This is plausible, making a challenge somewhat risky, especially this early with a low bid.
2. I need to find a valid higher bid (more than 2 quantity, or same quantity with a digit higher than 6).
3. I have three 7s in my hand. Bidding '2 7s' would be a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is guaranteed to be true since I hold three 7s.
4. Bidding '3 7s' is also a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and is also guaranteed to be true based solely on my hand (I have three 7s).
5. Comparing '2 7s' and '3 7s', the bid '3 7s' is stronger as it increases the quantity while still being completely safe for me. It puts more pressure on the opponent.
6. Therefore, making the safe and higher bid of '3 7s' is the best strategic move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I can see my entire hand (66836108) which contains no 7s. The current bid claims there are 3 7s total between both hands. Since I have 8 digits and see zero 7s in my hand, there would need to be 3 7s in the opponent's 8 digits to make this bid valid. While possible, this is statistically unlikely as it would require over 37% of their digits to be 7s. Given I have zero 7s and the improbability of them having 3 7s in just 8 digits, challenging is the safer move than making a higher bid.
