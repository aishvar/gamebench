Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, two 3s, two 0s, one 5, one 7, and one 8. A safe opening bid is to claim three of a digit I have multiple of, as it's likely there will be at least three total across both hands. I'll start with 3 4s, since I already hold two 4s, making it a reasonable and conservative opening bid.
