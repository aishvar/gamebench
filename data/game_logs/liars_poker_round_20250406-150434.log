Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 3s, two 8s, and two other digits (2, 9, 6). The most promising digits to start with are 0, 3, or 8 due to their frequency. A conservative and reasonable opening bid is 2 3s, reflecting my strong holding in that digit and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have the digits 1, 2, 7, 1, 6, 4, 8, 8 in my hand. I see that I have no 3s, so the 2 3s must be coming from Player 0. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I will increase the digit to 4s and keep the quantity the same, bidding 2 4s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 2, 8, 9, 3, 0, 6, 0, 3. I have zero 4s, so the current bid of 2 4s relies entirely on the opponent having at least two 4s, which is plausible but not certain. Since there are 16 digits total and it's early in the bidding, the bid of 2 4s is quite conservative and likely to be true. Challenging now is risky. Therefore, I'll make a safe higher bid by increasing the digit but keeping the quantity, such as 2 5s, to continue the bidding without overcommitting.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have one 6 and no 5s in my hand (12716488). Since I don't have any 5s, and the current bid is quite low (2 5s), I should bid higher. Bidding 2 6s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, making it a valid and not overly aggressive bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 2, 8, 9, 3, 0, 6, 0, 3. I have one 6, so with 8 unknown digits in Player 1's hand, the bid of 2 6s is plausible but not overly strong. Raising to 3 6s would be risky without more information. Instead, I can safely increase the bid by keeping the quantity at 2 but choosing a higher digit. I have two 8s, making a bid of 2 8s reasonable and safe as a minimal raise.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 8S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have the digits 1, 2, 7, 1, 6, 4, 8, 8 in my hand, so I have two 8s. This means there are at least four 8s in total. I can confidently bid higher than 2 8s. Bidding 4 8s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and I have evidence of two 8s in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '28930603', I have two 8s. The current bid is 4 8s, meaning there must be at least two more 8s in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. Since the average number of any specific digit across 16 digits is about 1.6, having four 8s total is already on the high side but plausible. However, five 8s would be very unlikely, so raising the bid on 8s is risky. Given that I hold two 8s, a challenge now is risky because Player 1 might indeed have two 8s, making four total. To avoid challenging a likely valid bid, I will instead increase the bid conservatively by moving to 4 9s, which is a minimal legal raise (same quantity, higher digit), putting pressure back on Player 1.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I need to make a bid that is higher than this. I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since the digit is already 9, I cannot increase it further, so I must increase the quantity. The next possible bid is 5 0s or more reasonably, 5 1s, 5 2s, etc., but I should first check if increasing the quantity to 5 is reasonable. Given that there are 16 digits in total, bidding 5 of any digit is possible but I need to consider my hand. My hand is 12716488, which contains one 8 and no 9s. To bid 5 of a digit, I should have at least one of that digit. I have one 8 and one 1. Bidding 5 1s or 5 8s seems plausible because it is just one more than the current total count for those digits if we assume the other player has a reasonable number of them. However, since the previous bid was 4 9s, and it's unlikely that the opponent has more than one 9 (since I have none), challenging seems like a viable option. But if I choose to bid, I should bid on a digit I have or a digit that is likely to be abundant. Since I have an 8, bidding 5 8s is a reasonable choice as it is a higher bid than 4 9s and utilizes the information about my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 28930603, I have two 8s. The current bid is 5 8s, which would require at least three 8s in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. Given that each player only has 8 digits, it's unlikely the opponent holds three or more 8s, as that would mean 5+ total, which is improbable. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
