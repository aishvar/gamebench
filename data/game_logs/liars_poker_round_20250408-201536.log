Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one '0'. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, and I know I hold one myself, it's very likely there is at least one zero overall. To increase the bid, the minimum valid move would be to bid 1 1s, 2 0s, or any higher combination. Given that I have two '3's, two '1's, and also a '0', a safe and strategic bid is 2 1s, leveraging the two '1's in my hand.
