Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 22837634, I have no 0s. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, it's quite plausible Player 0 has one 0, so challenging now is risky. I should make a safe higher bid. I notice I have two 2s, so bidding 2 2s increases the quantity and is supported by my hand, making it a strong and safe move.
