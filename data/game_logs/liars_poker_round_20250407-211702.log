Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand '27358552', I notice that the digit '5' appears three times, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. Opening with a conservative but credible bid on '5's leverages my strong count while leaving room to increase later if needed.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. The maximum possible number of 5s is 16. It is plausible that there are at least three 5s between the two players. However, to make a higher bid, I would need to bid at least '3 6s' or '4 0s'. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding '4 0s' seems risky. I could bid '3 6s'. I have two 6s in my hand. It is still plausible that there are at least three 6s. However, I will challenge to see if the opponent is bluffing. It is a risky move but I have no 5s.
