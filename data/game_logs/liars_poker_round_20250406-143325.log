Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 5s and two 9s. Starting with a bid of 2 5s is a safe initial move, as it's based on my actual hand and leaves room for others to raise.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I can see my own hand which is 29123137. I have one 1 and no 5s. The total count of 5s across all players is unknown, but I can make an educated guess. Since the current bid is relatively low (2 5s), and there are 32 digits in total across 4 players, it's plausible that there are at least 2 fives. However, I can try to bid higher to increase the stakes. I notice that I have a 3, so bidding on 3s could be a good strategy. I can bid 2 3s, which is a valid higher bid because the digit 3 is higher than 5 is not true, but I can increase the quantity or keep the same quantity with a higher digit. Increasing the quantity to 3 with a lower or same digit is possible, so I can bid 3 5s. Alternatively, bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity is also valid, so I can bid 2 6s or higher. Given my hand and the current bid, bidding 3 5s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Requesting action from Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand (56158472), I have two 5s. Since the current bid is 3 5s, and I hold two myself, it's quite plausible that at least one more 5 exists among the other 24 digits, making the bid reasonable. Challenging now would be premature. To raise, I can bid 3 6s, as I also have two 6s, and it's a strictly higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This is a safe incremental raise based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is a better option. My hand contains the digits: 1, 0, 3, 2, 9, 9, 3, 3. I have a total of 3 sixes are not present but I do have 3 threes and other digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. Given that I have no 6s, I should consider if there's a likely digit that could have a high count. Since 6 is not in my hand, I will focus on a digit I have. I have three 3s, and there are 8 digits per player, so 32 total digits. If I bid on a digit I have, like 3, I could say 4 3s as there are only 3 6s currently bid, I should try and increase the quantity or digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s and one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 4 3s, which is a high quantity for a digit that I don't have in my hand. Given that there are 32 digits in total and the bid is already at 4, it's risky to bid higher without knowing the distribution. Challenging seems like the safer option since the likelihood of there being at least four 3s across all players is uncertain.
