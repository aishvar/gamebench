Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 2 nines in my hand. It's plausible the opponent has at least 2 nines in their 8 digits, making 4 9s a reasonable opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 9s' and my hand '22366120', I notice that I don't have any 9s. However, I do have repeated digits that could potentially be bid upon. Since I need to make a strictly higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or the digit. Given that my hand contains two 6s and no 9s, bidding on a higher digit than 9 is not possible since 9 is the highest digit. Thus, I must consider increasing the quantity of a digit I have. However, without knowing the opponent's hand, it's risky to bid high on any digit without strong confidence. Considering the safest option, I could try to bid on a digit I have in abundance, but since I don't have more than two of any digit besides the 2s, and bidding '5 2s' would not be a valid increase from '4 9s' in terms of digit value, I must think strategically about challenging or finding a digit to bid on. Given the information and the goal to make a valid higher bid, I should consider the likelihood of the current bid being true and the potential for winning by challenging it. The bid '4 9s' seems somewhat high but not impossible given that each player has 8 digits and there are only two players. However, without having any 9s in my hand, I'm inclined to doubt the bid's validity, especially considering that to fulfill this bid, the other player must have at least 4 nines or we together must have at least 4 nines. This seems unlikely but not impossible. Given the uncertainty and the fact that I don't have a strong basis for a higher bid, challenging seems like a reasonable strategy, especially since making an incorrect bid could lead to losing if challenged back.
