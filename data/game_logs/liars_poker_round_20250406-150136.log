Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable bid. I have two 6s and two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s seems like a safe starting point, as it's likely that other players have at least one 6.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '10414876', I have one 6. Given there are 24 digits total, the current bid is 3 6s. Since I hold only one 6, it's plausible that the other two players collectively have at least two more 6s, making the current bid reasonable. Challenging now would be risky. To stay in the game, I can increase the bid slightly. I don't see enough evidence to jump to 4 6s confidently, but I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, so bidding 3 4s is a legal but lower bid, which is invalid. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can instead bid 3 7s, as I have one 7, and 3 7s is a higher bid than 3 6s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 7, 9, 0, 6, 4, 4, 2, 1. I see that I have two 4s and two 6s but no 7s. Given that the bid is 3 7s, I should consider if I can make a valid higher bid. Since I don't have any 7s, I will have to bid on a different digit. I have two 4s and two 6s, so bidding on 4 or 6 could be reasonable. The bid must be higher in quantity or digit. I will bid 4 6s because it's a higher digit than 7 and I have two 6s in my hand.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Given that the previous bids were relatively low, it's likely that there are not many 6s in the other players' hands. However, challenging might be risky since the bid is not extremely high. I should bid 5 6s, increasing the quantity based on my hand and the bid history.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (10414876), I have one 6. With 24 digits total among all players, a bid of 5 6s is plausible if the other two players collectively hold at least 4 sixes. Since I only have one 6, it's somewhat unlikely there are four more among the remaining 16 digits, as the expected average is around 1.6 sixes per hand. Given the current bid is already fairly high and the probability of five total sixes is low, the best move is to challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bid of 5 6s.
