Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, the digit '1' appears once, '2' once, '4' once, '5' once, '6' once, and '8' twice. A safe and conservative opening bid would be '2 8s' because I hold two 8s, making it reasonably likely there are more in total, or at least not an overbid. This is a standard opening strategy to start with a digit I have multiple copies of.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 8s'. I need to assess if this bid is likely to be true or not based on my hand. My hand is '78334270', which contains one '8'. Since there are two players and the total number of '8s' in both hands cannot exceed the total count of '8s' in my hand plus 8 (the number of digits in the other player's hand), the maximum possible '8s' is 1 (from my hand) + 8 (from the other player's hand) = 9. The bid '2 8s' is well below this maximum. I should consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. A higher bid can be made by either increasing the quantity or changing the digit to a higher one. Since '8' is a relatively high digit and the quantity is low (2), I can consider bidding on a higher quantity or a different digit. I'll choose to bid on a higher quantity is not feasible without more information about the other player's hand, so I'll consider bidding on a different digit. My hand has multiple '2's and '3's and '7's, which could be good candidates. However, without knowing the other player's hand, I'll play it safe and bid on a digit that is somewhat common. The current bid is on '8', so I can bid on a higher digit or increase the count. I'll bid on '9' with the same quantity or higher if possible, but since there's no '9' in my hand, I should be cautious. I'll increase the quantity on '8' or bid on a digit that is at least as likely as '8'. Since I have two '2's and two '3's, and no '9's, bidding '3 2s' seems reasonable as it's a higher quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 twos. Looking at my hand (62145188), I have one '2'. For Player 1's hand, the expected average count of '2's is roughly 0 to 2, but 3 total '2's is plausible. Since I hold one '2', Player 1 would need at least two '2's to make the bid valid, which is possible but not guaranteed. However, the bid is not overly aggressive yet, so challenging now might be premature. To maintain pressure and gather more information, I will make a conservative higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, choosing 3 5s (since I have two 5s), which is a safe incremental bid.

Player 0 bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 7, two 3s, one 2, and one 0 in my hand, but no 5s. The total count of 5s across both hands must be at least the count in my hand (0) plus the count in Player 0's hand. Since I don't know Player 0's hand, I need to assess the likelihood of the bid being true. Given that a bid of 3 5s is relatively low (maximum possible is 16), and considering the previous bids were on 8s and 2s, it's plausible that there's a reasonable count of 5s. To exceed the current bid, I need to bid on a higher quantity of 5s or a higher digit. I can see that I have a relatively high count of 3s (two), and the previous bid was on 2s (3 2s), so it's likely there's at least 3 3s in total. Thus, bidding 3 3s is not an option as it doesn't exceed the current bid. However, I can bid on a higher digit or the same digit with a higher quantity. The next higher digit is not an issue; I can bid on 6s or higher. But first, let's check if I can exceed by quantity. To exceed the bid of 3 5s by quantity, I need to bid at least 4 5s. Since I don't have any 5s, and it's a bit of a risk to assume there are 4 or more 5s in total, I'll consider bidding on a higher digit. The next higher digit is 6, and since I don't have any 6s, a bid of 3 6s seems reasonable if I assume Player 0 might have some 6s. However, I should be cautious and not overbid. Given the information and the need to exceed the current bid, bidding 3 6s is a safer move as it doesn't require assuming a high count of a specific digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 sixes. Looking at my hand 62145188, I have only one '6'. Since each player has 8 digits, the total is 16 digits. For the bid of 3 sixes to be valid, there need to be at least two sixes in the opponent's hand. While this is possible, the probability is moderate. Given that the bid history shows incremental increases without jumping to 4 of any digit, the opponent might be bluffing or pushing the limit. Since I only hold one '6', and 3 sixes overall is plausible but not guaranteed, challenging here puts pressure on the opponent's bid credibility. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move.
