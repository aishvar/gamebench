--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 9s. Since there are only 16 digits in total, it's unlikely there are 2 9s in play. I can either bid higher or challenge. Given the low probability of 2 9s existing, challenging seems the safer option.
