Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid and I have the digits 80821974, I can start by analyzing my hand. I see that I have two 8s, which is a relatively high count for a single digit. A reasonable starting bid could be based on my most frequent digit. I have two 8s, so bidding on 8s seems like a good start. However, I should also consider the total number of players and the total count of digits. With 3 players and 8 digits each, there are 24 digits in total. A conservative initial bid could be around 5 or 6 for a digit that I have. Since I have two 8s, bidding '5 8s' seems reasonable as it is a moderate increase from my count, considering the other players might also have 8s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 5 8s, which means there would need to be at least four more 8s among the other two players' hands. With only two other players holding a total of 16 digits, this seems unlikely. I should challenge the bid.
