Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 66481494, which contains two 4s and two 6s. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. Bidding on 6s seems promising since I have two of them. I'll start with a conservative bid of 3 6s, assuming that the other players might not have many 6s.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 3 sixes in total. Given that I have one 6 in my hand and there are 8 secret digits per player, I should consider the probability of there being at least 3 sixes in total. Since I only have one 6, I must rely on the possibility that other players have more sixes. However, I also need to consider that bidding too low might not be effective. A reasonable next bid could be higher than 3 if I think it's likely. I have a 6 in my hand, and bidding slightly higher seems reasonable.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand 97398175, I have no 6s at all. The current bid is 4 6s, which means there are allegedly at least four 6s among the 32 digits. Since I have zero, the other three players would need to collectively have at least four 6s. Statistically, the expected number of 6s across all hands is about 3.2 (32 digits divided by 10). Given I have zero, four 6s is already above average and less likely. Therefore, challenging the bid is a reasonable move.
