Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 95867790. I have two 9s and two 7s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. There are 16 digits in total across both players. The expected average count for any digit is 1.6. Since I hold two 9s, it's statistically probable (over 50% chance) that the opponent has at least one 9 in their hand of 8 digits. Therefore, bidding 'Three 9s' is a reasonably safe and informative opening bid. It utilizes one of my strongest counts (9s) and starts the bidding at a plausible level, using the higher value digit compared to 7s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 nines. Looking at my hand (31844236), I have zero 9s. Since I hold none, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must be holding all 3 or more nines in their own hand, which is statistically unlikely given only 8 digits. The expected average for any digit across both hands is roughly 1.6 (since 16 digits / 10 digits â‰ˆ 1.6), so having 3 or more 9s total is above average. Given I have none, it's improbable the total is at least 3. Therefore, the most strategic move is to challenge the bid.
