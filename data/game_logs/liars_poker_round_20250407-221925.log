Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have the digits 6, 0, 3, 9, and 7 in my hand. Since there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. I will start with a conservative bid of 1 for the digit 6, as I have one in my hand and it's a reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 6s, so the current bid of 1 6s is possible but not guaranteed. Since it's very early in the game with a low bid, challenging now is risky. To continue the game strategically, I will make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving from 1 6s to 1 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s and two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 1 7s, which is quite low. I can confidently bid 2 9s, as I have the digits to support a higher bid. This increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 85193153, I have one 9. The current bid is 2 9s, which is plausible since I have one and the opponent likely has at least one. To outbid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, the only valid next bid is 3 0s through 3 9s. Given that I only have one 9, it's risky to assume there are three 9s total. However, looking at other digits in my hand, I have two 5s, so bidding 3 5s is a reasonable and safe increase over 2 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s and two 9s in my hand, which gives me some confidence in the digits I can bid on. The current bid is 3 5s, and I can bid 4 6s since I have sufficient 6s and it increases both the quantity and the digit. This is a reasonable move.

Player 0 bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 85193153, I have no 6s at all. The current bid is 4 6s, which requires at least 4 sixes among the combined 16 digits. Since I have zero 6s, all four or more would need to be in Player 0's hand. The probability of that is quite low, making the bid seem risky. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
