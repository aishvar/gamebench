Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 2, one 3, one 5, two 6s, one 7, and one 9. A safe opening bid is usually 2 of a digit I have at least one of. I have two 6s, so I can confidently start with '2 6s' as a reasonable opening bid based on my hand.
