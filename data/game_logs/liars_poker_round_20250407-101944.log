Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 3s, and one 1, 5, 6, and 7 each. The most common digits are 0 and 3 with two occurrences each. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 0s, reflecting my own hand and leaving room for escalation.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 10703356, I have one '1'. The current bid is 2 1s, which is plausible since I already hold one. To raise, I can either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity on a higher digit. Since I have two '3's, bidding 2 3s is a safe incremental bid that is valid and based on my hand's strength.
