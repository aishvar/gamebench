Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. To make a valid bid, I can either increase the quantity of 1s to 4, or bid a different digit with a quantity of at least 3. I have two 6s and one 9. I could bid 3 6s or 3 9s. I will bid 3 6s, as it is less likely to be challenged than 3 9s, and is more likely than 3 1s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I don't have any 7s in my hand. Since the previous bids have been relatively low, and I don't have information to suggest a high number of 7s, I will conservatively increase the bid to 4 0s. This is a safe bid and allows me to gather more information about the distribution of digits.
