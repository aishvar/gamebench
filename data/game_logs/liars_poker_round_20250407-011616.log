Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s, one 6, one 9, and two 0s in my hand. Since there have been no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable bid. Bidding 2 5s is a valid move since I have them and it establishes a starting point for the game.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 24583798. The current bid is 2 5s. I have one 5, meaning the bid is true if the opponent (Player 0) has at least one 5, which is quite likely for a low bid like this. Challenging seems risky. I need to make a higher bid. A higher bid must be quantity > 2 or (quantity = 2 and digit > 5). I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding '2 8s' would be a safe, valid higher bid, guaranteed true by my hand alone. However, bidding '3 8s' is also plausible. Since I have two 8s, this bid requires Player 0 to have only one 8 for it to be true. Given there are 8 digits in their hand, having at least one 8 is reasonably probable (expected number is 0.8). Bidding '3 8s' increases the quantity, puts more pressure on the opponent, and leverages the strongest digit count in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s and one 9 in my hand, but no 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, which I find unlikely since I don't have any 8s. The maximum count for 8s could be 16, but it's still a stretch to assume there are 3 or more 8s. I will challenge this bid.
