Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. I can increase the bid to 3 0s, which is a safe increase in quantity and a change of digit. This avoids potentially bidding high on a digit I don't have.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 0s. Since I only have one, the opponent would need at least two 0s to make the bid valid. This is uncertain, and challenging is a safer move given the potential risk of the bid being correct.
