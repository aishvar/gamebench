Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I need to start the bidding. My hand contains two 0s, one 1, one 5, one 6, one 7, one 4, and one 9. A safe opening bid would be '2 0s', as I already have two 0s in my hand, and it is likely that the opponent has at least one more 0 to support this bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. The current bid is 2 0s, which is plausible because I might expect my opponent to have at least one 0 as well. Since I have only one 0, it's risky to challenge this low bid. The next minimal valid bid is 2 1s, but I have no 1s, making it less credible. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 3 of a digit where I have some evidence. I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s leverages my hand strength and is a reasonable escalation beyond 2 0s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have no 8s in my hand, which makes it less likely that there are at least three 8s across all 16 digits. Since I cannot reasonably increase the bid with confidence and the current bid seems unlikely, I will challenge.
