Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, there are no 0s, so I cannot directly support the current bid. However, since the bid is very low (only 1 zero among 16 digits), it's quite likely that at least one zero exists in the opponent's hand, making an immediate challenge risky. The safest strategic move is to make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, such as 1 1s.
