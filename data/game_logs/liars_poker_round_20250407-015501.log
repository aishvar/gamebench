Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start by bidding on a digit I have. Bidding 2 9s is a safe and reasonable move, as it's based on the count in my hand and gives me a good chance of winning if challenged.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have the digits 70156548 in my hand, and I notice I don't have any 9s. The current bid is '2 9s', which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 2 nines between our hands. Since I have zero 9s in my hand, this means Player 0 must have at least 2 nines in their hand for this bid to be valid. This is certainly possible - they could have 2 or more 9s. I could challenge, but it's a risky move this early in the game with such a low bid. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 5, one 6, one 7, one 8, and two 4s. I could bid '3 0s', but that's risky since I only have one 0. A safer option would be to bid based on my strongest digit, which is 4 (I have two of them). I'll bid '2 4s' - wait, that's not higher than '2 9s' because 4 < 9. I need to either increase the quantity or use the same quantity with a higher digit. Since there are no digits higher than 9, I must increase the quantity to at least 3. I'll bid '3 0s', hoping Player 0 has at least two 0s to make this valid.

Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s. Bidding 3 6s is a higher digit and reasonable based on my hand, as it requires only one more 6 from Player 1.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (70156548). The current bid is 3 6s, meaning the opponent is claiming there are at least 3 sixes total between our hands. Since I have 1 six, this means they're claiming they have at least 2 sixes in their hand. This is certainly possible. I could bid 3 7s, 3 8s, 3 9s, or increase the quantity to 4 of a lower digit. Looking at my hand, I have one 7 and one 5, so bidding on those digits doesn't give me an advantage. I do have two 5s, but that's not enough to confidently bid 4 5s. I'll bid 3 7s, which is a minimal increase over the current bid while staying reasonable based on the digits I can see.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, making the current bid of 3 7s suspect. Given the previous bids and the distribution of digits, it's plausible that Player 1 is bluffing. Challenging could reveal the truth and potentially give me the win if the total 7s are less than 3.
