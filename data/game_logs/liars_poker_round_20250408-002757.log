Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand, making it a strong foundation for a bid. Starting with 3 3s is a safe and reasonable opening move given the information I have.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have the hand 60140728, which contains no 3s. The opponent bid '3 3s', which means they're claiming there are at least 3 threes between both our hands. Since I have zero 3s in my hand, all of those 3s would have to be in the opponent's hand. The opponent has 8 digits total, so it's certainly possible they have 3 or more 3s. However, I can't be sure. I need to either make a higher bid based on what I know or challenge. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, one 1, one 4, one 6, one 7, one 2, and one 8. I could bid on 0s since I have two of them, or I could bid on another digit with a higher quantity. Since the current bid is '3 3s', I can bid '3 4s' (same quantity, higher digit) which seems reasonable given I have one 4 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s. By bidding 4 3s, I increase the quantity, making it a higher bid. This bid will succeed if Player 1 has at least one 3, which is plausible. Challenging the current bid is risky because if Player 1 has two 4s, I would lose. Therefore, bidding 4 3s is a strategic move to control the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (60140728), I have zero 3s. The current bid claims there are at least 4 3s total between both players. Since I have none, all 4 would need to be in my opponent's hand. While possible, this seems somewhat unlikely as it would mean half of their hand consists of 3s. However, I don't have strong evidence to challenge yet. For my bid, I could bid 4 4s (same quantity, higher digit) or 5 of any digit. I have one 4 in my hand, so bidding 4 4s would require my opponent to have 3 more, which is possible. I also have two 0s and one each of 1, 7, 2, 8, so I could consider those digits too. Since 4 4s seems reasonable based on my hand, I'll make that bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand, making it unlikely that the total number of 4s is four or more. The current bid is 4 4s, and given my hand, I doubt there are enough 4s. I choose to challenge.
