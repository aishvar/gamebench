Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand (62912053), I have two 2s. Considering the opponent's hand, there's a possibility of one or two more 2s. Bidding 3 2s is a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 twos. Looking at my hand (0, 4, 8, 7, 0, 9, 6, 7), I have zero '2's. The probability that my opponent holds at least 3 twos in their 8 digits is low, as the expected number of 2s in 8 random digits is less than 1. Bidding higher on 2s would be risky without any in my hand. Making a higher bid on another digit is safer if I have a strong count. I have two zeros in my hand, so bidding 3 zeros is plausible, matching the quantity but with a higher digit, which is a valid raise. Alternatively, I could bid 4 of some digit. Since I have two 7s and two 0s, but no other strong counts, bidding 4 of any digit would be speculative. Therefore, the best move is to bid 3 zeros, a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (04870967), there are no 2s, which means the entire count of 2s depends solely on Player 0's hand. The current bid is 3 2s, implying Player 0 must have at least 3 or 4 2s for the bid to be plausible. Given 8 digits, it's statistically unlikely for Player 0 to hold 3 or more 2s alone. Therefore, the bid is probably an overstatement, making a challenge the optimal move.
