Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With no previous bids, I should start with a reasonable bid. Bidding 2 6s seems like a good starting point, increasing the quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I don't have any 6s in my hand. I could bid higher, but I don't want to overcommit. Since the bid is relatively low, I will bid slightly higher, increasing the quantity to 3 and choosing a digit that I have a good number of, which is 5. I have three 5s.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable, increasing the digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. To bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. Bidding 4 of any digit seems like a reasonable increase in quantity. I will bid 4 0s, as it's the lowest digit and unlikely to be challenged immediately.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 6s and one 1. The current bid is 4 0s, which seems unlikely given the total count of digits is 16. I can reasonably bid 2 1s or challenge the current bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 3/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 4 0s. I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity or digit. Since I have no other 0s in my hand, I should increase the digit to a higher value. I see no other digits in my hand that would allow me to increase the quantity without being too aggressive. I will increase the digit to 1, which is a reasonable next digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. I can increase the quantity to 5 and choose a low digit like 0, or I can increase the digit to something I have in my hand. I have three 5s and two 3s. I will bid 4 3s, which is higher than 4 1s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have two 6s in my hand. I can increase the digit to 6, which is higher than 3, and also increase the quantity to 4, which is the same as the current bid quantity. This seems like a reasonable bid based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. I also have three 5s and two 3s. I could bid 5 0s, 5 1s, 5 2s, 5 3s, 5 4s, or 5 5s. I will bid 5 0s, since that is the lowest digit and doesn't rely on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. My bid of 2 0s seems reasonable, as it only increases the quantity by one.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 0S'
Parse Error: Bid 2 0s is not higher than current bid 5 0s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. Since the current bid is only for 0s, I can increase both quantity and digit by bidding 3 0s, as it's a more conservative approach.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Parse Error: Bid 3 0s is not higher than current bid 5 0s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 3/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have 1 0 in my hand, which is not enough to make a valid higher bid. I should challenge.
