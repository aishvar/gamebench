Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s, two 8s, and one each of digits 2, 6, 0, and 7. With multiple 8s and 9s, it is safer to start bidding on one of these digits. Since I have two 8s, bidding conservatively at 3 8s is a reasonable opening move, assuming the opponent might have at least one additional 8.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s and one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which seems unlikely given the high digit and my hand. I can increase the bid to 4 1s, which is a valid higher bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 29609878, containing digits 2, 9, 6, 0, 9, 8, 7, and 8. I have no '1's in my hand. The opponent bid '4 1s', meaning they believe there are at least four '1's across both hands. Since I have none, all four would have to be in the opponent's hand. Given the total of eight digits per player, it's possible but statistically unlikely that they have exactly half their digits as '1's. However, the current bid is still relatively low, and challenging at this stage might be risky. Instead, I can safely bid higher on digits I already have multiples of. I have two '8's and two '9's. Previously, I bid '3 8s', suggesting confidence in '8's. Since I already have two '9's and haven't bid on '9's yet, bidding '4 9s' seems reasonable, as it leverages the two '9's I already hold and requires only two more from the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s and one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 4 9s, which seems unlikely given that there are only 16 total digits. I don't have any 9s, and even if Player 0 has some, it's hard to believe they have at least 4. Therefore, I should challenge this bid.
