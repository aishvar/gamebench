Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand, making it a strong foundation for a bid. Bidding 3 5s is a safe and reasonable starting point as it matches the number of 5s I hold, ensuring the bid's validity regardless of the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. I have a few digits in my hand that I can use to make an informed decision. I see that I have one 5 in my hand, and the bid is 3 5s. I also notice that I have a 7 in my hand. Since the current bid is 3 5s, I can bid higher by increasing either the quantity or the digit. I have a total of 8 digits in my hand, and none of them are 6 or higher than 7 except for one 7 and one 6, and two 5s are not present but one 5 is. A reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity or the digit. Given that I have one 5, bidding 4 5s seems risky without knowing the distribution of Player 0's hand. However, I can see that bidding 3 6s or higher would be a safer bet if I think Player 0 might not have many 6s or higher digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 5s. Since I have three, Player 1 must have at least one to meet the bid, making it likely valid. Challenging would be risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 6s while keeping the quantity at 4, as I have two 6s and Player 1 might have enough to reach four.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains one 6. Bidding a higher quantity with the same or higher digit seems reasonable. I have no information about Player 0's hand beyond the current bid, but I do know that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider what I have in my hand and what seems plausible. I can see if I can increase the quantity or the digit. The current bid is 4 6s, so I could try bidding 5 6s or switch to a higher digit if I have it.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 6s. Considering I have two, Player 1 would need at least three to make the total five. However, without certainty that they have enough, challenging seems prudent as the bid may be too high.
