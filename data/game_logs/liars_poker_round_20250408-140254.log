Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, and the current bid is 1 0s. Given that there are 16 digits in total and I already hold two 0s, it is very likely that there are more 0s across both hands. A reasonable next bid would be to increase the quantity to 2 while keeping the digit as 0.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 1s. Given that there are 16 digits in total and Player 0 is a 50/50 player, it is reasonable to assume there could be at least one more 1 in their hand. To keep the game progressing and avoid challenging too early, I will make a higher bid of 3 1s, increasing the quantity while keeping the same digit.
