Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Since there's no previous bid, I can start with a reasonable bid. Bidding 3 3s seems safe, as the other player might have at least one 3, making the total count three or more.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one 3 in my hand (88619523). So, the total count of 3s is at least 1 (mine) + unknown (opponent's hand). I can see that I have two 8s. I can make a higher bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and is based on my hand's information.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, and challenging this bid could reveal if Player 1 has enough 8s to meet the bid. Given that I have zero 8s, it's possible that Player 1 might not have three 8s, making this a good opportunity to challenge.
