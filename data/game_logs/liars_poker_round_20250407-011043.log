Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to establish an opening bid. My hand is 61543082, containing one each of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8. The lowest possible bid is '1 0s'. While safe, it provides little information and puts no pressure on the opponent. A bid of '2' of a digit I hold is statistically reasonable. There are 16 total digits. I have one '4'. The probability that the other player has at least one '4' in their 8 digits is slightly better than 50%. Therefore, bidding '2 4s' is a plausible opening move that increases the stakes slightly compared to a bid of '1'.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand, which already meets the current bid of 2 4s. Since I know there are likely more 4s in Player 0's hand, it is reasonable to increase the quantity to 3 for 4s. This bid is safe and strategically increases the pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 61543082. I have one '4'. The current bid is '3 4s', meaning Player 1 claims there are at least three '4's in total across both hands (16 digits). For this to be true, Player 1 must have at least two '4's. Player 1 raised my previous bid of '2 4s'. This could mean they have multiple '4's, or they could be bluffing, or they might have only one '4' and are assuming I have more than one (which I don't). Given that I only have one '4', requiring Player 1 to have two or more '4's out of their 8 unknown digits makes the bid uncertain. The quantity '3' is relatively low and plausible, but challenging seems like a reasonable option to test Player 1's claim, especially since I don't have strong support for a higher bid with my diverse hand (mostly single digits).
