Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand 97901801, I have two 0s, two 1s, two 9s, one 7, and one 8. The best opening bid often targets digits I hold multiple of, maximizing the chance the total count across both hands is at least that number. Bidding 2 of any digit I hold two of is reasonable. I'll open with '2 1s' because 1s tend to be common and I have two myself.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the likelihood of the current bid '2 1s' being valid. In my hand of 54482506, I have 0 ones. The opponent claims there are at least 2 ones total, which means they must have at least 2 ones in their hand. This is entirely possible and even quite likely. With 8 digits in their hand, the probability of having 2 or more ones is reasonable. Since I don't have any ones in my hand, I can't directly confirm their claim, but it's not suspicious enough to challenge. Therefore, I should make a higher bid. I could bid more ones (e.g., '3 1s'), but since I don't have any ones, that's risky. Instead, I'll bid on a digit I do have. I have one 2, one 4 (twice), one 5, one 6, one 8, and one 0. My best option is to bid '2 4s' since I have two 4s in my hand, making this a safe bid that advances the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 97901801. Counting digits, I have: two 0s, two 1s, one 8, two 9s, one 7. The current bid is 2 4s, meaning at least two 4s across both hands. Since I have zero 4s, the opponent would need to have both 4s to make the bid valid, which is possible but somewhat unlikely. Given that two 4s is a modest bid and plausible, challenging now is risky. Instead, I can safely raise the bid by quantity or digit. Since I have two 1s, a natural higher bid is 3 1s, which is plausible given my hand alone and likely safer than challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge the claim of '3 1s' total in both our hands. Looking at my hand (54482506), I have 0 ones. The opponent claims there are at least 3 ones total, which means they must have at least 3 ones in their hand. While this is certainly possible, I need to consider the probability. The chance of having 3 or more of any specific digit in 8 random digits is not extremely high. Given that I have zero 1s in my hand, and the opponent would need to have at least 3 in their 8 digits, I think challenging is the better option here.
