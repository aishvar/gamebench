Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 68837537, I notice I have two 3s, two 7s, two 8s, one 5, and one 6. It's generally good to start with a conservative but solid bid based on my hand. I will bid '2 7s' because I hold two 7s, making it a safe opening bid.
