Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. I could bid higher, but since the previous player is a naive 50/50 player, they are likely to make weak bids. I will bid slightly higher to test them. I will bid 3 2s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. I could bid 4 3s, or I could bid a higher digit. Given that the previous bid was 3 2s, and now 3 3s, I will bid 4 0s. This increases the quantity and avoids bidding on a digit I only have one of.
