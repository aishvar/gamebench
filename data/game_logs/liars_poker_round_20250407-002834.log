Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, and the current bid is 1 0s. Since I know there is at least one 0 in my hand, and Player 0 has also bid 1 0s, it's likely there is at least one more 0 in their hand. However, to make a safe and higher bid, I can increase the quantity to 2 0s, which is a reasonable assumption given the information.
