Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits 6, 2, 3, 8, 9, 7, 4, 9. The digit 9 appears twice, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. Starting with a conservative yet reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 9s, as I already have two and it's likely there may be more in the opponent's hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, making it unlikely there are 3 zeros across both hands, since that would require my opponent to have all 3. Statistically, it's improbable for one player to hold 3 zeros out of 8 digits. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best strategic move.
