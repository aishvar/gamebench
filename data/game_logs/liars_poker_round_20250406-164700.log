Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. Since this is the first bid and I want to start conservatively, bidding 3 5s is reasonable - it only requires my opponent to have one more 5 to be valid. Starting with a moderate bid gives me room to gather information from subsequent bids.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s, which means there must be at least two more 5s in the opponent's hand. Since the average distribution would suggest this is possible but not guaranteed, I can either challenge or make a conservative higher bid. I choose to bid 3 6s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, as I have two 6s in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (59143459), I have zero 6s. The opponent bid '3 6s', claiming there are at least 3 sixes total. Since I have none, this would mean they need to have at least 3 sixes in their hand of 8 digits. While possible, this seems unlikely. Additionally, they raised my '3 5s' bid (which I made knowing I had two 5s) to '3 6s', suggesting they might be bluffing. Given I have zero 6s and the probability of them having 3 or more 6s in their hand is relatively low, challenging is the better option than making a higher bid.
