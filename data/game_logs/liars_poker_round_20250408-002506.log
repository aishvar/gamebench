--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid and I'm starting, I should make a reasonable initial bid based on my hand. My hand is 49079186. I count 2 eights and 1 nine. A reasonable starting bid could be on the digit '9' or '8'. I have one 9, so bidding '2 9s' seems like a good start as it suggests there's at least one more 9 in the other player's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, making the current bid of 2 9s questionable. Since I cannot make a higher bid without risking a higher quantity of 9s, which I lack, challenging is the safer option to test the validity of the bid.
