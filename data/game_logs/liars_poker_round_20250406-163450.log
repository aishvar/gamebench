Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 5, one 0, two 8s, one 4, one 6, and one 3 in my hand. Since it's the first bid, I need to start with a reasonable quantity and digit. A bid of 2 8s is a safe and logical choice, as I already have two 8s in my hand, making it highly likely that there are more 8s across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 35142527, there are no 8s. Since the total number of digits is 16, and I have zero 8s, the opponent must have at least two 8s for their bid of 2 8s to be valid. This is plausible, so challenging now is risky. A safe next bid would be 2 9s, which is the minimal legal raise (same quantity, higher digit), keeping the pressure on without overcommitting.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 9s. Given that there are 16 total digits in play, it is plausible that there are at least 2 9s across both hands. However, I cannot challenge because the bid seems reasonable. To increase the bid, I will raise the quantity to 3 and choose a digit I have more of in my hand. I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s is a logical next move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 3, 5, 1, 4, 2, 5, 2, 7, which contains zero 8s and zero 9s. The current bid is 3 8s. Since I have no 8s, all three or more 8s would need to be in Player 0's hand, which is very unlikely given only 8 digits. The previous bid escalation suggests bluffing or pushing limits. The probability of Player 0 holding 3 or more 8s is low, so challenging is the best move.
