Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid, so I need to start the bidding. In my hand, I have two 0s and two 1s, which are my most frequent digits. I want to start with a reasonable bid that reflects my hand while leaving room for flexibility in future bids. Therefore, I will bid 3 0s, as it is a safe and strategic opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s. Since I don't have any 0s, it's unlikely there are 3 0s in total. However, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity and choosing a digit I have more of. Bidding 4 2s seems reasonable, as it increases both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 2S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. Looking at my hand, I have no 2s. This means there are at most 8 unknown digits in Player 1's hand that could potentially be 2s. For the bid to be valid, Player 1 would need at least 4 2s in their hand, which seems plausible but not guaranteed. However, instead of challenging, I can safely increase the bid based on the digits I do have. I have three 0s in my hand, so bidding 5 0s seems reasonable, as it increases the quantity and is supported by my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 0s. Considering there are only 16 total digits in play, it's unlikely there are 5 or more 0s. I should challenge the bid.
