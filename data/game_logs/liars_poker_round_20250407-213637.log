--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, the digit '4' appears twice, which is the highest frequency among all digits in my hand. A conservative and strategic opening bid would be 2 of 4s, as I know I have at least 2, and it's likely there are more in the opponent's hand. This sets a reasonable starting point without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 4s', which means Player 0 claims there are at least two '4s' across both players' hands. In my hand (10839157), I do not have any '4s'. Therefore, the maximum number of '4s' that could be present is 2 (from Player 0's claim). Since I have no '4s', I believe Player 0's bid is unlikely to be valid. Thus, I will challenge the bid.
