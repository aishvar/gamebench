Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand, making it a safe bet to start with a bid of 2 3s. This ensures the bid is valid since the total cannot be less than 2, and it sets a moderate starting point.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (29581194), I don't have any 3s. The current bid is 2 3s, which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 2 threes between both our hands. Since I have no 3s in my hand, that means all the claimed 3s must be in Player 0's hand. This is certainly possible - they could have 2 or more 3s. I need to make a higher bid. I have two 1s, one 2, one 4, one 5, one 8, one 9, and one 9 in my hand. I could bid on 1s since I have two of them, or I could bid on another digit. Since 2 3s is a relatively low bid, I'll make a slightly higher bid of 2 4s. I know I have one 4 in my hand, so I only need Player 0 to have one more 4 for this to be valid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid is 2 4s. Bidding 3 3s increases the quantity, making it a higher bid. I'm hoping the opponent has at least one 3 to make the total count meet or exceed my bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have the hand 29581194, which contains no 3s. The current bid is '3 3s' from my opponent. Since I have no 3s in my hand, there can be at most 8 3s total (all in my opponent's hand). The bid of '3 3s' claims there are at least 3 3s total, which is possible but not certain. I could challenge, but it's a relatively low and reasonable bid, so my opponent might well have 3 or more 3s. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 1s, one 8, one 5, one 4, and one 2. I could bid '3 4s' (same quantity, higher digit) but I only have one 4 in my hand. I could bid '3 5s' which is safer since I have a 5. I could also bid '3 9s' which would be even better since I have two 9s in my hand. I'll go with '3 9s' as it's a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and I have good support for it with two 9s in my hand.

Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, making the current bid of 3 9s suspect. The jump to 9s from lower digits seems like a potential bluff. Challenging is a good move to test if the bid is valid.
