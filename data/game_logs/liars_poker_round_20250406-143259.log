Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains two 6s and two 8s. I should start with a conservative bid to gauge the game. Bidding 2 8s seems reasonable as it's based on my own hand and doesn't overcommit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand (72343044). The current bid is 2 8s, which seems low but possible given there are 3 other players. However, since I have no 8s, the likelihood of there being at least 2 8s across the other players is uncertain. To play it safe, I will make a higher bid on a digit I have in my hand. I have two 4s, so bidding 3 4s is a reasonable increase in quantity while staying on a digit I know exists.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have a lot of information about the other players' hands, I'll play it safe and increase the digit. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s and one 5. The current bid is 3 5s. Since I hold one 5 myself, it's plausible there are at least two more among the remaining 24 digits, so challenging now might be risky. However, I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s (same quantity, higher digit) is a safe and legal way to raise, supported by my hand and consistent with prior bids.

Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. Given that I have two 8s in my hand and the total number of 8s could potentially be higher with other players having some, bidding a higher quantity seems risky without knowing the distribution of digits in other players' hands. However, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 8s and the bid is 3 8s, I could try to bid higher with a different digit that I have multiple of. I have two 6s and two 5s, but no higher digit than 8. I will increase the quantity and bid 4 6s or 4 5s, but 6 is higher than 5. So, I will bid 4 6s or 4 5s if I don't think the current bid is likely to be true. Given my hand, bidding 4 6s or 4 5s seems reasonable.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 6s. Since I don't have any 6s, it's unlikely that there are four 6s across all players' hands. Challenging seems like the best move here.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) challenges Player 0's (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bid of 4 6s.
