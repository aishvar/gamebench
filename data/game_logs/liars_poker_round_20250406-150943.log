Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids yet. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 32440947, which contains two 4s and one 9. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and not too high. Bidding 2 4s seems like a safe start as it reflects a count I know exists and is not too aggressive.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 4s, but I do have two 8s and two 9s. The current bid is 2 4s, which is relatively low. Since I hold two 8s, it's quite likely there are at least three 8s across both hands, given the distribution of digits. Therefore, a safe and strategic move is to raise the bid to 3 8s, increasing both the quantity and the digit, based on my hand's strength.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have the hand 32440947, which contains one 8 and two 4s. The bid of 3 8s implies there are at least three 8s in total. Given that I have one 8, there must be at least two 8s in the other player's hand. This seems plausible but is a bit aggressive. However, I can counter by bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit. Since I don't have any digits higher than 8 in significant numbers, I'll consider bidding on the next higher digit, which is 9. I have one 9 in my hand, so bidding 3 9s seems reasonable as it matches the quantity but increases the digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s and two 8s. The current bid is 3 9s. Since I already hold two 9s, it would only require my opponent to have at least one 9 for the bid to be valid, which is quite plausible. Challenging now is risky. To make a higher bid, I can consider 4 8s because I have two 8s, and four total 8s across both hands is reasonable. This bid increases the quantity while choosing a digit I have strong holdings in.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand is 32440947, which contains two 4s and no 8s or 9s. The previous bid was 3 9s, and now Player 1 switched to 8s with the same quantity. I have some information about my hand, but not the other player's. The bid of 4 8s is not extremely high since it's below the maximum possible quantity of 16. However, considering I have no 8s, it's possible that Player 1 might be bluffing, but there's still a reasonable chance they have some 8s. I need to either challenge or make a higher bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep it the same and increase the digit. Since I have information that could support a higher bid (my hand has digits that could be used to justify a bid in a higher digit), I'll consider bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity. The next higher bid could be 4 9s, which is a valid bid because it's the same quantity but a higher digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s. For the current bid of 4 9s to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least two 9s as well. While this is possible, having a total of four 9s across 16 digits is relatively unlikely, especially since I hold a significant portion of the 9s already. Therefore, challenging seems like the best move here.
