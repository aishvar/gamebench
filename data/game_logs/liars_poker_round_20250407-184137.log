--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 3s, two 1s, one 4, and one 6. A safe opening bid is typically 2 of a digit I hold multiple times. I have two 5s, so bidding '2 5s' is reasonable, as there are likely additional 5s in the opponent's hand, making this a conservative and credible opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. My hand contains no 5s, so I cannot make a higher bid on 5s. However, I can bid on a different digit that I have multiple of, such as 8s (I have 2 8s). Since the bid must exceed the current bid in either quantity or digit, I can bid 2 8s, which is a higher digit than 5.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. Looking at my hand (55431652), I have no 8s, which means both 8s must be in Player 1's hand for the bid to be true. While it's possible Player 1 has exactly two 8s, it's somewhat unlikely given the distribution of digits. Since there are zero 8s in my hand, and the bid requires both 8s to be on the opponent's side, challenging is a good strategic move here.
