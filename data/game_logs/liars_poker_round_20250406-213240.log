Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Since this is the first bid, I need to set a reasonable quantity. Bidding 3 7s is a good starting point, assuming the opponent might have at least one more 7.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. Bidding 4 7s would be risky as it relies on the opponent having at least one 7. A safer approach is to bid on a digit I have, increasing the quantity. I have two 4s, so bidding 4 4s is a reasonable option, increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on 2s, as I have two of them. Bidding 4 2s is also a viable option. Considering the previous bid was 3 7s, I will bid 4 4s as it's a more conservative and plausible bid given my hand.

Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. Considering that each player has 8 digits, the maximum possible 4s in total is 16. However, since I have none, it's possible that the opponent might have some. But 4 4s seems high considering that the previous bid was 3 7s. I think challenging is a good move here.
