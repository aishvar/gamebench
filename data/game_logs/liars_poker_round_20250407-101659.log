Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Since it's very early in the game, a safe and natural move is to increase the bid slightly. I have two 3s and two 7s, so bidding 2 3s or 2 7s is reasonable and supported by my hand. Choosing 2 3s advances the quantity and digit logically.
