Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 2, two 4s, one 7, one 9, one 3, one 8, and one 1. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 4s, as I hold two 4s myself, making it quite likely that at least two 4s exist in total.
