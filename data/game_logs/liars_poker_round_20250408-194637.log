--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 85077192. I have two 7s, which means I'm certain there are at least two 7s in total. The current bid is 2 6s. By bidding 2 7s, I follow the rule for a valid higher bid (same quantity and higher digit) and also back it up with my own cards. This makes my bid a safe move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s, which is possible if the opponent has at least one 7. Since I have one 7, it's plausible that there are at least two 7s in total. To increase the bid safely, I can bid 3 3s, as I have two 3s in my hand and the opponent might have at least one more.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 3S'
Player 0 bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I don't have any 3s in my hand, so the current bid of 3 3s entirely depends on my opponent's 8 digits. Statistically, the chance that they possess at least three 3s is extremely low (around 4%), making this bid very unlikely to be true. Given this probability, challenging is the most sensible option.
