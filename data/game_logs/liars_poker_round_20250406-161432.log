Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 4, one 3, one 2, one 5, one 7, one 8, one 9. The most frequent digit I have is any of them at 1 occurrence. Since this is the opening bid and I want to leave room for the game to develop, I'll start with a conservative bid of '2 4s'. I have one 4, so it's reasonable to expect at least one more 4 in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 37800610, I have no 4s. The current bid is 2 4s, which is plausible since my opponent could have two or more 4s. Challenging now is risky as the bid is conservative. Instead, I can make a safe incremental bid. I have two 0s in my hand, so bidding 3 0s is reasonable, as it's likely there is at least one more zero in my opponent's hand, making the total at least three.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 78524349, I have no 0s. The opponent bid '3 0s', claiming there are at least 3 zeros total. Since I have none, all 3 would need to be in their hand of 8 digits, which is possible but seems unlikely. However, given it's early in the game and a relatively low bid, I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. I have two 4s in my hand, so bidding '3 4s' would be a safe play - raising the digit while keeping the same quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 37800610, which contains three 0s and zero 4s. The current bid is 3 4s. Since I have no 4s, the chance there are three or more 4s in total relies entirely on my opponent having all three or more, which is unlikely. Given that, challenging the bid is the best move.
