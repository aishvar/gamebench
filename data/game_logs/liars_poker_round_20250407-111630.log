Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 8, and no 0s, 7s, or 9s. Since I have one 6, and my opponent likely has about one 6 as well (on average), bidding 2 6s is reasonable. I could bid higher, but a conservative opening is strategic.
