Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without much risk. I see I have two 7s and one 8 in my hand. A bid of 2 7s seems reasonable and not too risky, given that I have some information about my own digits.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have 2 7s in my hand. The current bid is only 2 7s. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have the digits 1, 3, 1, 8, 5, 6, 4, 7 in my hand. I can see that I have one 7 in my hand. Given that the bid is 3 7s and I have one 7, I should consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since I only have one 7, I cannot confidently bid higher on 7s. However, I can try to bid on a different digit or challenge the current bid. My hand contains a 6 and other digits that could potentially be higher than 7. I will bid on a higher digit with a reasonable quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 5 8s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I need to assess if it's likely or not. Given that I have one 8 in my hand and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I must consider if my hand can support a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent. My hand contains one 8, and I do not know the other player's digits. However, since the bid is already at 5 8s and there are only 16 digits in total, I should consider if there's a high likelihood that there are indeed at least 5 8s in total. Given my hand and the constraint that there are only 16 digits in play, bidding higher seems risky without more information.
