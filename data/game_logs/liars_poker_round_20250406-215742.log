Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s, one 6, one 7, and one 0 in my hand. Since there are no bids yet, I need to start with a reasonable bid. Bidding 2 1s seems appropriate as it reflects my hand and sets a foundation for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. I could bid 3 0s, which is a slightly higher bid and uses a digit I have in my hand, but I think it's more likely that there are at least two 1s in total. I will bid 3 1s to increase the bid slightly.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 1s. I can increase the quantity to 4 while keeping the digit the same, which seems reasonable given my hand. This also puts pressure on my opponent to either accept the new bid or challenge it.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Since there are 16 total digits, it's plausible that there are at least four 1s. I could bid higher, but I'll play it safe and challenge to see if they are bluffing.
