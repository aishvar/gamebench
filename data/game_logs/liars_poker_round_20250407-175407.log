Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player to bid, I need to establish an opening bid based on my hand (54085146). I have two 4s and two 5s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. The total number of digits across both players is 16. The expected count for any digit is 1.6. Bidding on one of my frequent digits is a good strategy. A bid of '3 Fours' is a reasonable starting point. I hold two 4s, so this bid requires the opponent to have at least one 4 among their 8 digits. The probability of the opponent having at least one 4 is 1 - (9/10)^8, which is approximately 57%. This makes the bid plausible and puts some pressure on the opponent without being overly aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '3 4s'. My hand is 86783079, which contains zero 4s. For the current bid to be accurate, the opponent (Player 0) must hold at least three 4s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, this is not guaranteed, making a challenge a potential option. However, a bid of quantity 3 is relatively low early in the game. My hand contains two 8s and two 7s. Bidding based on these pairs is a strong strategy. A bid of '3 7s' would require the opponent to have at least one 7. A bid of '3 8s' would require the opponent to have at least one 8. Both are statistically likely. Bidding '3 8s' is higher than '3 7s' and '3 4s', is well-supported by my hand (I have two 8s), and puts the pressure back on the opponent without making an overly aggressive jump in quantity. It only requires one 8 among the opponent's 8 unknown digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I hold one 8 (54085146). For the bid to be true, Player 1 needs to hold at least two 8s out of their eight digits. This is plausible but not certain. Challenging is an option. Alternatively, I can make a higher bid. My hand contains two 4s and two 5s. My previous bid was 3 4s, which Player 1 did not challenge but instead bid 3 8s. This might suggest Player 1 is not strong in 4s. Bidding based on my two 5s seems like a strong alternative. A bid of 4 5s is higher than 3 8s (quantity increases from 3 to 4). This bid requires Player 1 to hold at least two 5s. Given I hold two 5s, this feels like a reasonable escalation that leverages my hand's strength and puts pressure back on Player 1, forcing them to decide whether to challenge or bid even higher.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 86783079. The current bid is 4 5s. I have zero 5s in my hand. For the current bid to be true, Player 0 must have at least four 5s in their 8-digit hand, which is statistically possible but not highly probable. My previous bid was 3 8s, supported by the two 8s in my hand. Instead of challenging the 4 5s bid, which relies solely on Player 0 potentially bluffing or having a very specific hand, I can make a higher bid based on my own hand. Bidding 4 8s is a logical progression from my previous bid. It requires only two 8s from Player 0's hand (since I have two), which is statistically more likely than Player 0 having four 5s. This bid leverages my hand's strength and puts pressure back on Player 0.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 54085146. I have one '8'. The current bid is '4 8s', made by Player 1. For this bid to be accurate, there must be a total of at least four '8's across both hands (16 digits total). Since I only hold one '8', Player 1 must hold at least three '8's in their 8-digit hand. While Player 1 has bid '8's twice (3 8s and 4 8s), suggesting they may hold some '8's, needing three specific digits out of eight is statistically less likely (expected number is 0.8). My alternative is to bid higher, such as '5 4s' or '5 5s' (as I hold two of each). However, Player 1 bypassed opportunities to challenge or bid on '4's or '5's when I bid them previously, instead pushing '8's. This could imply they don't hold many '4's or '5's, making a bid of 5 on those digits risky. Given the statistical unlikelihood of Player 1 holding three '8's and the risk associated with bidding higher on digits they avoided, challenging the '4 8s' bid appears to be the most strategically sound move.
