--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. It's possible there are at least three 7s in total. I could bid 4 0s, but that seems weak. I will bid 4 7s to increase the pressure and see if my opponent challenges.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 7s. Since I know there are at least 4 7s across both hands (including mine), I can increase the bid to 5 7s, which is a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. It's possible there are at least five 7s in total, but it's also possible there aren't. I could bid higher, but I'm not confident. Given the bid history, and the fact that the opponent kept raising, it's more likely they are bluffing. Therefore, I will challenge.
