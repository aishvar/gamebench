Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have three 5s, two 0s, and one each of 7, 2, and 8. Starting with a conservative yet strong opening bid based on my three 5s makes sense. Therefore, I will bid 3 5s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s and one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. I can increase the quantity to 4 while bidding on a digit that I have (7). This seems reasonable as I can claim there are at least 4 7s in total.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7. The current bid is 4 7s, meaning there must be at least four 7s across both hands. Since I have only one, the opponent would need to have at least three 7s, which is quite unlikely given the distribution of digits. The probability that the opponent holds three or more 7s out of their eight digits is low, making this a risky bid for them. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
