Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have the digits 3, 5, 2, 0, 8, and 6 in my hand. The current bid is None, so I can make any bid. I notice I have multiple 5s, but I also have a 3, which is a relatively high digit. I should aim to increase the digit value to make a stronger bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 0, 5, 5, 7, 4, 9, 8, 3. I only have one 3. The current bid is 2 3s, meaning at least two 3s total. Since I have one 3, it is quite plausible the opponent has at least one as well, making the current bid likely valid. Therefore, challenging now is risky. To safely continue, I will increase the bid by raising the digit while keeping the quantity the same, bidding 2 4s since I have one 4 and 16 digits total, making two 4s plausible.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 2 4s. Since I have the digit 4, I can confidently make a higher bid of 3 4s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 4S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 4. The current bid is 3 4s, so there must be at least two more 4s in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. While it's possible, it's somewhat unlikely. However, it's early in the game and a conservative challenge may be premature. Instead, I can safely increase the bid by keeping the quantity the same and raising the digit. I have two 5s, so bidding 3 5s is reasonable based on my hand and keeps the pressure on Player 0.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have a 5 in my hand. Bidding 4 5s increases both quantity and digit, making it a more believable bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 5s (digits: 0, 5, 5, 7, 4, 9, 8, 3). The current bid is 4 5s. Since I hold two, the opponent would need at least two 5s out of their eight digits to make the bid valid. While that is possible, it's somewhat unlikely as the expected number of 5s per player is roughly 1.6 (16 digits / 10 digits x 2 players = 1.6 per player). Given this, the bid of 4 5s is borderline but more likely to be an overbid. I will challenge.
