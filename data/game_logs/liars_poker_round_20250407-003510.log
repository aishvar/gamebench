Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: With no bids yet, I have a wide range of options. I notice I have a few high-value digits (8, 4, 9, 3). I'll choose a digit with a relatively high quantity in my hand, aiming to make a reasonable bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand, so the total possible 4s across both hands is at least 4 (3 from the bid + 1 from my hand). To make a higher bid, I can increase the quantity to 4 or choose a higher digit with a quantity of at least 3. Since I have two 5s, bidding 4 5s seems reasonable, as it increases both the quantity and the digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have three 5s in my hand. Bidding 5 5s would be a valid higher bid, as it has the same digit but a higher quantity.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 5 5s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 5, increasing the quantity to 6 5s is risky without knowing the opponent's hand. However, I can bid 6 of a higher digit that I have more of, like 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, which makes 6 6s a reasonable bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 6S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s and one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 6 6s. I can improve this by bidding 7 5s, increasing the quantity, but since I don't have a 6, I have to choose a lower digit. Alternatively, I can bid 6 7s, increasing the digit, but since I have a 6, I prefer this option.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 7S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 6 7s, which is already high. Considering the bid history and my hand, I can either challenge or bid higher. Since I only have one 7, bidding 7 7s would be risky. However, I can bid 7 of a lower digit that I have more of, like 2s or 5s, but that would not be a higher digit. Given the current bid and my hand, challenging seems the safer option as it's unlikely there are 6 or more 7s in total.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) challenges Player 0's (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bid of 6 7s.
