Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a reasonable bid based on the digits in my hand. I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s seems like a safe starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 8.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (14663540), I have zero 8s. Since there are 16 digits total and I hold none, the opponent would need to have all 3 or more 8s alone to make the bid valid. The probability that the opponent has 3 or more 8s in their 8 digits is quite low. Therefore, it's reasonable to challenge this bid.
