Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I can start with any valid bid. Looking at my hand (39440458), the digit '4' appears three times, which is the highest count of any digit in my hand. Starting with a bid of 3 4s is a strong opening based on my hand.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains zero 4s. Player 0's bid of 3 4s requires them to have at least three 4s in their 8-digit hand. Statistically, the probability of a player holding three 4s in 8 random digits is low (~3.8%), making this bid unlikely to be valid. Challenging offers a high chance of success.
