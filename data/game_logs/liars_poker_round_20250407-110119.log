Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have two 1s, two 3s, one 2, one 8, one 9, and one 0 in my hand. A conservative starting bid would be to bid on a digit I have multiple of. Bidding 2 1s is a safe starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 5, 8, 2, 0, 1, 7, 0, 4. I have one '1'. The current bid is 2 1s, so the opponent is claiming there are at least two 1s total in both hands. Since I only have one 1, it's plausible the opponent has at least one 1, making the bid reasonable. I will make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a safe strategic move.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding 3 2s would be a valid bid, but it doesn't leverage my other cards. I have three 3s, so bidding 3 3s is a reasonable option, increasing the digit. Alternatively, I could bid 3 1s, but that's not as strong as 3 3s. Since the previous bid was 2 1s, and I have multiple 1s, a challenge is risky. I'll go with 3 3s.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 58201704, which contains zero 3s. Given that the current bid is 3 3s, and I have none, the opponent must be assuming there are at least three 3s between both hands. Since I hold none, all three would need to be in their hand, which is somewhat unlikely but possible. However, it's safer to increase the bid rather than challenge early. I have two 0s in my hand, so bidding 3 4s (next digit up) is a minimal raise, but I can make a stronger bid leveraging my zeros. I will bid 3 5s, increasing the digit to a mid-range number, which is a safe incremental raise without overcommitting.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Given the bid history, the opponent seems willing to bid aggressively. I have two 1s, but that's already been bid on. I have two 3s, which was also bid on. I have one 8, one 9, one 2, and one 0. Bidding 4 5s is a reasonable attempt to push the opponent, and it's higher than the current bid. Alternatively, I could challenge, but given the opponent's previous bids, they may actually have 3 5s. Therefore, I will bid higher.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 5. The current bid is 4 5s, which implies there must be at least three 5s in the opponent's hand. Given that each player has only eight digits, having three or more 5s in one hand is statistically unlikely. Since I only hold one 5, the total count of 5s probably does not reach four, making the current bid a good candidate to challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bid of 4 5s.
