Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to start the bidding. I have two 7s in my hand, which is a relatively safe digit to bid on. Starting with a bid of 2 7s is reasonable based on my hand and leaves room for higher bids later.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I don't have any 7s in my hand, making it uncertain whether the total number of 7s meets the current bid of 2 7s. Since I can't make a higher bid with my current hand, challenging is the most strategic move to test the validity of the bid.
