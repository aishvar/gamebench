Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, the counts of digits are: 0 appears twice, 5 appears twice, 4 appears twice, 6 appears once, 7 appears once, and 8 appears once. The most frequent digits in my hand are 0, 4, and 5, each appearing twice. A safe opening bid is to start with 2 of one of these digits. I'll choose digit 5 for my opening bid since it is common in my hand and likely to be present in the opponent's hand as well.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. Since I don't have any 5s, I can challenge the bid, hoping that Player 0 doesn't have enough 5s to meet the bid. Alternatively, I can make a higher bid by choosing a different digit. Given that I have three 9s, bidding 2 9s is a valid higher bid and leverages my strong hand in 9s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 0,8,5,5,4,6,0,7. I have zero 9s. The current bid is 2 nines, which means the opponent is claiming there are at least two 9s combined in both hands. Since I have none, all two or more 9s must be in Player 1's hand. The probability that Player 1 has two or more 9s in eight digits is relatively low (approximately 12% chance). Given this low likelihood, it is strategically sound to challenge the bid rather than risk escalating it.
