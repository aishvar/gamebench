Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, which is a strong starting point. Bidding 2 9s is a reasonable and safe opening move, as it sets a baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand, which makes it less likely that there are 2 or more 9s across both hands. Since the total number of digits is only 16, and I know none of mine are 9s, I believe the bid is unlikely to be valid. Therefore, I should challenge.
