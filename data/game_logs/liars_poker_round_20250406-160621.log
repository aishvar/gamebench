Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 11510076, I notice I have three 1s and two 0s. Starting conservatively with a bid that reflects my strong count of 1s, I will open with '3 1s'. This is a reasonable opening bid that represents my hand strength and sets a baseline.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have zero 1s in my hand (34222395). For the current bid to be true, the opponent must hold at least three 1s, which is possible but not highly probable. However, I have three 2s in my hand. Bidding '3 2s' is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Since I hold three 2s myself, this bid is guaranteed to be true regardless of the opponent's hand. Making a safe, truthful bid early in the game puts pressure on the opponent without taking an immediate risk.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 1s, one 0, two 1s (already counted), one 5, one 0, one 7, and one 6. Specifically, I have zero 2s. The current bid is 3 2s, so for that bid to be valid, my opponent would need to have at least 3 2s, or 2 if I had one, but I have none. The probability that the opponent has 3 or more 2s in their 8 digits is quite low. Given this, it's reasonable to challenge the bid.
