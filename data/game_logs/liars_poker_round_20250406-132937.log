Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 79009398. I have three 9s, two 0s, one 7, one 3, and one 8. The most frequent digit in my hand is 9 (three times). Since this is the first bid, I should start with a plausible bid based on my hand. Having three 9s myself, it's quite likely there's at least one more 9 among the opponent's 8 digits. Bidding '4 9s' is a reasonable opening bid, leveraging my strongest digit count and making a statistically probable claim.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze whether to challenge or make a higher bid than '4 9s'. Looking at my hand (16635277), I don't have any 9s. This means all 4 claimed 9s would need to be in my opponent's hand. Since each player has 8 digits, it's certainly possible my opponent has 4 nines. However, this is their opening bid, and starting with such a specific claim suggests they might actually have several 9s. If I challenge and they do have 4 nines, I lose immediately. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I could bid '5 0s', '5 1s', etc., or I could bid '4 0s' (which isn't valid since digit must be higher when quantity stays same). Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 6, two 5s, one 3, two 7s, and one 2. I'll bid '5 1s' - I have one 1, and my opponent would need to have four 1s for this to be true, which is unlikely but possible. This is a reasonable strategic move.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 79009398. I have zero 1s. The current bid is 5 1s, made by Player 1. For this bid to be true, Player 1 must have at least five 1s in their 8-digit hand, as I contribute none. The probability of a player having 5 or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is very low (approximately 0.04% assuming random distribution). While Player 1 might have a strong hand in 1s, the statistical likelihood is against it. My previous bid was 4 9s (I have three 9s), and Player 1 ignored this, jumping to 5 1s. This deviation makes the 5 1s bid suspect. Challenging seems like the most strategically sound move given the low probability of the bid being true based on my hand.
