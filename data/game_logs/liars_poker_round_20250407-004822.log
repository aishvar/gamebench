Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid. I will start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s and two 7s. A bid of '2 6s' or '2 7s' seems reasonable. I will choose to bid '2 6s' as it is a straightforward increase based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, which allows me to make a higher bid than the current 2 6s. Bidding 2 8s is a safe move since I can guarantee at least two 8s in total, making the bid valid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 3, 1, 7, 9, 6, 7, 2, 0. I see that I have two 6s and two 7s and one 9. Considering the digits I have, bidding 3 7s seems reasonable as it is a higher quantity than 2 and a higher digit than 6, but I only have one 6 and two 7s. I should try to increase the quantity or digit while considering my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, so all 7s must be in Player 0's hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which seems unlikely as Player 0 would need at least three 7s. Considering the bid history and the possibility of bluffing, challenging is a reasonable move.
