Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid, I should make a reasonable starting bid. I have two 0s in my hand. A bid of 2 zeros seems plausible and not overly aggressive. It's a safe starting point to gauge the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 64814620, I have one 0. For the current bid of '2 0s' to be valid, there would need to be at least one more 0 in the opponent's hand. This is quite possible since they bid it. Given that each player has 8 digits, the maximum possible 0s is 16, and I can see my own hand has one 0, it's reasonable to assume there could be at least one more 0 in the opponent's hand. Rather than challenge, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, which makes for a safe bid since I know those exist for certain.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have zero 4s in my hand. My opponent bid 2 4s after I bid 2 0s. It's possible they have two 4s, but it's also possible they are lying. However, I have a 9, 8, 7, and 5, and the opponent hasn't bid on those yet. I will bid higher than 2 4s, but not excessively high, to test their claim. Bidding '3 4s' feels reasonable. Alternatively, I could challenge, but I prefer to gather more information by bidding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Let me analyze this carefully. In my hand, I see only one 4 (in 64814620). The current bid claims there are 3 fours total between both hands. Since I have 1 four, this means the opponent would need to have 2 fours in their hand for this bid to be true. While this is possible, I can see that the bidding has escalated specifically around fours, with the opponent raising from my '2 4s' bid to '3 4s'. Given that I know I only have 1 four, and the opponent would need exactly 2 fours for this to be true, it seems more likely they are bluffing by raising the bid. The probability of them having exactly 2 fours when they chose to raise on this specific digit seems low.
