Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (22845108), I have: two 2s, one 8, one 4, one 5, one 1, one 0. Since I have two 2s in my hand, that's a good starting point. I could bid 2 2s or even 3 2s (expecting the opponent might have at least one more). Starting with a moderate bid is strategic - not too aggressive but also not too conservative. I'll bid 3 2s, which is reasonable given I already have two 2s in my hand, and there's a decent chance my opponent has at least one more.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. In my hand, I have no 2s, making it less likely that there are 3 or more 2s across both hands. However, it is still plausible given there are 16 total digits in play. To stay in the game and avoid challenging too early, I will make a higher bid. I have two 5s and two 7s in my hand, so bidding 4 5s is a reasonable step up in quantity while leveraging my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The current bid is '4 5s', meaning Player 1 claims there are at least 4 fives in our combined hands. Looking at my hand (22845108), I have one 5. For the bid to be true, Player 1 would need to have at least 3 fives in their hand. While possible, that seems somewhat unlikely. I could challenge, but there's still a good chance they have enough 5s. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my own hand, I have two 2s and one 8. I could bid '5 2s', but that would require Player 1 to have at least three 2s, which is risky. A safer option is to increase the digit but keep the quantity, bidding '4 8s'. I have one 8, so I'm claiming Player 1 has at least three 8s, which is the same risk level as the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. In my hand, I have no 8s, which makes it unlikely for there to be at least 4 8s across both hands, as the maximum number of digits is 16. Based on this, I believe the bid is too high, and challenging it is the best move.
