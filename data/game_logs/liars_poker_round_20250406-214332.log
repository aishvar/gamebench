Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I have to open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 2s, two 3s, one 6, one 9, and one 1. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 8s, reflecting the two 8s I hold, which is a conservative yet credible start.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s, and I have one 8 in my hand. Since I don't have any additional information about Player 0's hand, I must consider the possibility that they have at least one 8 as well. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and the bid is relatively low, it seems plausible that there could be at least two 8s in total. However, without more information or a clear advantage, making a higher bid might be risky. Considering my hand and the low current bid, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I notice that I have multiple 5s and 3s, but bidding on those directly might not be the best strategy since the current bid is on 8s. A safer approach would be to bid on a digit that I have at least one of, to minimize the risk of an immediate challenge. Since I have a 9, which is higher than 8, and only one 9, bidding the same quantity but a higher digit seems like a reasonable strategy, as it gives me a chance to win without overcommitting.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s and two 9s. The current bid is 2 9s, which I can already fully account for with my own digits, making it quite plausible. To raise, the minimal higher bid would be 3 9s or 2 0s (but 2 0s is not higher). Since I already have two 9s, it's somewhat likely the opponent has at least one more 9, making a bid of 3 9s reasonable. Alternatively, I could increase the digit at the same quantity, but 2 '10s' is invalid. Therefore, the best move is to bid 3 9s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. Given my hand, 35548039, I have one 9. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since there's no higher digit than 9, I must increase the quantity. Bidding 4 9s would be a reasonable move, considering I have one 9 and it's possible the other player also has a few 9s, given their previous bid of 3 9s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 86283291, I have two 9s. The current bid is 4 9s, which would require at least two more 9s in the opponent's hand of 8 digits. While not impossible, having four or more total 9s is somewhat unlikely given typical digit distribution. Since I hold two 9s and the opponent would need to have at least two as well, the probability decreases. Therefore, challenging here is a good strategic move.
