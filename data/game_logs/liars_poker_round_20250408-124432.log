Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start with a reasonable initial bid. Looking at my hand (digits: 3,9,8,5,4,4,6,8), I notice I have two 8s and two 4s. With two of each digit already in hand, bidding '3 8s' is a safe and reasonable starting bid, as it's likely at least one more 8 exists in the opponent's hand.
