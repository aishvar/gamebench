Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since it's the first bid, I should make a reasonable opening bid. I have two 8s in my hand. A bid of '8 E' (8 eights) seems plausible but not overly aggressive. It's a good starting point to gauge the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid, so I need to establish a baseline. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 'BID: Q 8' seems reasonable, as it's unlikely the opponent has enough 8s to make a higher quantity believable. Starting with a quantity of 2 is conservative but safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 3/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since it's the first bid, I should make a reasonable starting bid. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 2 eights seems like a safe and plausible starting point. It's not too high to risk an early challenge, but it's not so low that it leaves much room for the opponent to maneuver.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 71509690. This gives me two 0s, one 1, one 5, one 6, one 7, zero 8s, and two 9s. The current bid is '2 8s' made by Player 0. I have zero 8s. For the current bid to be true, Player 0 must hold at least two 8s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, challenging this early on a low bid is risky. A better strategy is to make a higher bid based on my hand. I have strong counts of 0s (two) and 9s (two). Bidding '2 9s' would be a safe, truthful bid, as I hold two 9s myself. However, a slightly more assertive bid leveraging my count is preferable. Bidding '3 0s' is a valid higher bid (quantity increases). I hold two 0s, meaning this bid is true if the opponent has at least one 0 among their 8 digits. Statistically, it's likely the opponent has at least one 0 (expected value is 0.8). Therefore, bidding '3 0s' is a reasonably safe bid that increases the pressure.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 zeros. I have no zeros in my hand. My opponent bid 3 zeros after I bid 2 eights. It's highly probable my opponent is lying, as it's unlikely they have three zeros given the previous bid of two eights. Challenging seems like the best course of action, as it's unlikely the bid is truthful and I have no zeros to contribute to a higher bid.
