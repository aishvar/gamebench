Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game. My hand is 70990761. I have two 0s, one 1, one 6, two 7s, and two 9s. The highest frequency digits in my hand are 0, 7, and 9, each appearing twice. There are 16 total digits in play (2 players * 8 digits). On average, any digit appears 1.6 times. Having two 9s is above average. Bidding '3 9s' requires the opponent to have at least one 9 among their 8 digits, which is statistically likely. This bid leverages my strongest digit (9) and sets a reasonable starting point without being overly aggressive.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. Since I have no 9s in my hand, the burden of meeting this bid falls entirely on Player 0. With only 8 digits in their hand, having three 9s is unlikely. Challenging this bid is a strategic move to test the validity of Player 0's claim.
