--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, two 5s, two 3s, one 8, and one 4. The most frequent digits are 6, 5, and 3, each appearing twice. An opening bid of 3 is reasonable considering the total of 16 digits in play. I'll start with 3 6s, leveraging my two 6s and expecting at least one more in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on the possibility that the other player has at least 3 6s. Challenging seems unlikely to be successful, as the other player could potentially have all three 6s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand, which is a strong holding. The current bid is 4 6s, implying there is at least one 6 in the opponent's hand. This is plausible, but pushing to 5 6s would require there to be at least two 6s in their hand, which is less likely. Since I already hold three 6s, the probability of the total being 4 is reasonable, but 5 is risky. Therefore, I will challenge the current bid of 4 6s.
