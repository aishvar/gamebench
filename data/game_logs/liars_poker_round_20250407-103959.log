Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Since I must raise the bid, the safest approach is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity at 1. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, which makes 1 8s a safe bid and strictly higher than 1 0s.
