--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening bid and I have three 8s in my hand, a safe and strong initial bid would be 3 8s, reflecting my known count and putting pressure on others to either challenge or raise with less certainty.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s. Since there are 4 players with 8 digits each, the total possible 8s is 32. A bid of 3 8s is relatively low, but I don't have enough information to confidently challenge. I can make a safer bid by increasing the digit to 9, which I have two of in my hand, suggesting there might be more in total.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. I have a few digits in my hand that could contribute to a higher bid. Since I have two 6s and one 9, and considering the total number of digits in play, I should think about making a bid that seems plausible but also challenging for others. Given that I have no 9s but have other digits, I can try to bid higher on a digit that I have in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand is 16831921, which contains one 1, one 6, one 8, one 3, one 9, and three 1s (or 2, depending on interpretation, but clearly two 1s). I see that I have one 6. Assuming the distribution is somewhat even, there are likely more 6s across other players. The bid of 4 6s is relatively conservative given that there are 32 digits in total. I can bid higher than 4 6s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 5 6s seems plausible as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, bidding 4 7s is also an option as it keeps the same quantity but increases the digit. Given that I don't have any 7s, I'm somewhat skeptical about the number of 7s, but it's a reasonable bluff. However, increasing the quantity to 5 6s seems more reasonable than bidding on a higher digit without knowing its distribution.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (80759887), I have three 8s and zero 6s. The current bid is 5 6s. Since I have no 6s, the total 6s among all players must be at least 5 for the bid to be valid. Assuming an average distribution, each digit appears roughly 3 times across 32 digits, making 5 6s somewhat unlikely. Given that earlier no one bid on 6s until Player 2, and I have zero, it's risky to assume there are 5 or more. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
