Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first move of the game. I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand (42936078), I have one of each digit: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. I don't have any 1s or 5s. Since I have exactly one of each digit I possess, I should bid conservatively. I know there are 16 total digits in the game (8 in my hand, 8 in my opponent's hand). A reasonable opening bid would be to claim there are at least 2 of a digit I already have one of. I'll choose 2 7s, which is a modest claim since I already have one 7 and there's a reasonable chance my opponent has at least one 7 as well.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 19185446, containing digits 1, 9, 1, 8, 5, 4, 4, and 6. I have no 7s myself. The current bid is 2 7s, meaning the opponent claims there are at least two 7s total. With 16 digits in total, it's plausible the opponent has two or more 7s. Since I cannot verify or strongly doubt this claim, and considering the bid is still low, challenging would be risky. Instead, I'll make a slightly higher bid on a digit I hold multiple copies of. I have two 1s and two 4s, making these safer digits to bid on. I'll bid 3 4s, increasing the quantity and using a digit I have two copies of, making it a safer bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '3 4s'. Looking at my hand (42936078), I have one 4. For there to be at least 3 fours total, the opponent would need to have at least 2 fours in their hand. This is certainly possible, as the probability of having at least 2 fours in 8 random digits is reasonable. Given that I have one 4 myself, I think the bid of '3 4s' is likely valid. I should make a higher bid. I notice I have one 7 and one 8 in my hand. I could bid '3 5s', '3 6s', '3 7s', or '3 8s' (keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit), or I could increase the quantity to 4 with any digit. Since I have a 7 in my hand, bidding '3 7s' seems reasonable, as it would require my opponent to have at least 2 sevens, which is possible but not guaranteed. This is a safer bid than increasing the quantity to 4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 19185446, which contains no 7s. The current bid is 3 7s. Since I have no 7s, the opponent would need to have all three 7s themselves. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely. However, I must consider carefully before challenging. Alternatively, I could make a higher bid that aligns better with my hand. I have two 4s, and previously bid 3 4s myself. I also have two 1s and two 9s. Given that I've already bid 3 4s, and my opponent moved away from that digit to bid 3 7s, they may not have many 4s. It might be safer to bid higher on a digit I hold strongly. I have two 9s; bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This seems safer than challenging at this stage.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge. In my hand, I have one 9, so I know there's at least one 9 in play. For there to be at least 3 9s total, Player 1 would need to have at least 2 9s in their hand. This is possible but not guaranteed. Looking at the bid history, Player 1 increased from my '3 7s' to '3 9s', choosing to increase the digit rather than the quantity. This could indicate they have some 9s, or they might be bluffing. Since I only have one 9, and the total bid is still relatively low (3 out of a possible 16 digits), I think making a higher bid is safer than challenging. I'll bid 4 0s, which is higher than 3 9s by increasing the quantity. I have one 0 in my hand, so I'm contributing to this bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand (19185446) has no 0s. The opponent raised to '4 0s' after previous bids on digits 7, 4, and 9. Given I have zero 0s, the opponent would need to have at least four 0s in their eight-digit hand alone, which seems statistically unlikely. Therefore, challenging this bid seems the best move.
