Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid and there is no current bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 5s, two 0s, one 7, and one 9. A conservative but reasonable opening bid would be 2 of any digit I have multiples of. I'll choose 2 5s since 5 is a common digit and I have two of them, making the bid quite safe.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 5s in my hand (93806790). Since the opponent bid '2 5s', they would need to have both 5s in their hand for their bid to be valid. While possible, I can make a safe higher bid based on what I see in my hand. I have two 9s, which is a higher digit than 5, so I can bid '2 9s' with confidence since I can see them in my hand.

Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 2 9s, so for that bid to be valid, my opponent must likely have at least one 9 as well. It's plausible, but raising on 9s would be risky without more information. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s and two 5s, which gives me a better opportunity to increase the bid safely. Since the last bid was 2 9s, I can outbid by making a quantity increase to 3 of a digit I hold multiples of. I will bid 3 3s, leveraging my two 3s and hoping the opponent has at least one.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 3S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 93806790, I have zero 3s. The opponent bid '3 3s', claiming there are at least 3 threes total. Since I have none, this means they would need to have at least 3 threes in their hand. While possible, having 3 of the same digit is somewhat unlikely. Given I have a 6 in my hand, I could bid '3 6s' which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit), but since I only have one 6, that would be risky. The safer play is to challenge the '3 3s' bid, as the opponent would need to have at least 3 threes in their hand for their bid to be valid.
