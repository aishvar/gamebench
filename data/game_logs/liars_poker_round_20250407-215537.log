Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my first turn. I should start with a conservative bid to test the waters. Analyzing my hand '12608380', I have a count of 2 for digit '1', 1 for '2', 1 for '0', 1 for '3', 1 for '8'. I see an opportunity to bid on a low digit with a reasonable quantity. Bidding on '1' seems like a good starting point since I have 2 of them, which is a relatively high count for a first bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my first turn. I should start with a conservative bid to test the waters. I have a 2, 2, 0, 8, 3, 8, 0, 8 in my hand. The digit 0 appears twice, which is a good starting point. However, bidding 2 of any digit might be too low to gather information. I have multiple 8s, which could be a good bet if I think the other player might have at least one 8 or another high digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand (96537132) contains zero 8s. The current bid is 2 8s, meaning there must be at least two 8s combined in both hands. Since I have none, Player 0 would need to have both 8s in their hand of 8 digits. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely to have exactly two 8s concentrated solely in their hand. Given no evidence of more 8s on my side, and that the bid is still relatively low but not supported by my hand, the prudent move is to challenge.
