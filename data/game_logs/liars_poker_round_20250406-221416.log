Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make the first bid. I have a total of 2 eights (8s) in my hand. It would be strategic to start with a bid of 2 8s, as it establishes a baseline for the game while staying within the limits of my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I reviewed my hand (6,7,1,4,4,1,6,7) and noticed I have no 8s. This means the current bid of 2 8s relies solely on the opponent's 8 unknown digits. With each digit roughly equally likely, the chance that the opponent holds at least two 8s is only about 19%, which makes the bid highly unlikely. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
