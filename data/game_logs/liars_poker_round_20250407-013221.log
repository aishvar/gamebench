Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. My hand contains two 6s, two 7s, two 3s, one 2, one 4, and one 5. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 7s, as I hold two 7s myself, making it likely there are at least two in total, and it sets a modest starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have zero 7s in my hand (19080952). For the bid to be true, the opponent must have at least two 7s. While possible, it's an early bid and challenging feels premature. I need to make a higher bid. Options include increasing the quantity or keeping the quantity at 2 and increasing the digit. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding '2 9s' is higher than '2 7s' (same quantity, higher digit) and is guaranteed to be true based on my hand alone, regardless of the opponent's hand. This is a safe and strategically sound move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 67723546, I have two 7s, which supports my initial bid of 2 7s. The opponent raised to 2 9s. Since I have zero 9s, I suspect their bid is speculative. It is unlikely there are two 9s in total unless they have both, which is possible but risky. Rather than challenge a reasonable bid of 2, I will increase the quantity to 3 on a digit I have multiples of â€” 7. Since I hold two 7s, bidding 3 7s is plausible and applies pressure back.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have zero 7s in my hand (19080952). For the bid to be true, Player 0 must have at least three 7s in their 8-digit hand. Player 0 previously bid 2 7s, I bid 2 9s, and they raised to 3 7s. This suggests they might have two or three 7s. Challenging is risky because their re-bid on 7s implies some confidence. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s is a credible bid based on my hand, requires only one 9 from Player 0 (plausible), and is higher than the current 3 7s bid. It also builds on my previous bid of 2 9s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (6,7,7,2,3,5,4,6), I have no 9s. Since the total digits are 16, and I hold zero 9s, all 3 or more 9s must be in Player 1's hand. The probability of Player 1 having all 3 or more 9s is low (binomially, chance of 3+ 9s in 8 digits is under 10%). Therefore, the last bid of 3 9s is unlikely to be valid, so challenging is the best move.
