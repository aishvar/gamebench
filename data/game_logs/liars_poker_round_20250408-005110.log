--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 7s, two 5s, one 8, one 3, two 9s, two 5s. The most frequent digits are 9, 7, and 5, each appearing twice. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 9s, reflecting my strong holding and leaving room to escalate.
