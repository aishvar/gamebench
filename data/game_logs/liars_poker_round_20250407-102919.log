--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 1s, and one each of 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9. A safe and informative opening bid would be 2 3s, as I already have two 3s myself, making it likely that there are at least two 3s in total, and potentially more. This is a conservative but solid opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 3, 2, 9, 4, 5, 1, 6, 3. I have one 4. The current bid is 2 4s, so there must be at least two 4s across both hands. Since I only have one, it's quite plausible that the opponent has at least one 4, making the bid reasonable. Challenging now is risky. To raise, I can either bid 2 5s or 3 3s, since both are strictly higher. I have two 3s, making a bid of 3 3s relatively safe, as it only requires one 3 from the opponent to be valid. Therefore, I will bid 3 3s.
