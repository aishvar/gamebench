Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 9.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have zero 9s, so the opponent must have at least three. The probability of them having three or more 9s in their 8-digit hand is only ~3.8%, making challenging a high-probability win.
