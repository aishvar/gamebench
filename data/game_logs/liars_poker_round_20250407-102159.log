Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open with an initial bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 6s, two 0s, one 7, and one 9. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 6s, as I already hold two 6s myself, making it a conservative yet credible starting bid.
