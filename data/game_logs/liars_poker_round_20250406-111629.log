Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn and the current bid is 'None', so I must make the first bid. My hand is 21983237. I have two 2s and two 3s, which are my most frequent digits. The total number of digits across all 3 players is 24. The expected number of any digit is 2.4. Since I already have two 2s, it's statistically likely (around 81.5% chance) that there is at least one more 2 among the other 16 hidden digits. Therefore, bidding '3 2s' is a reasonably safe opening bid that is supported by my hand and probability.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '2' in my hand (47203661). The current bid is 3 2s. Given that there are two other players with unknown hands, it's possible that the total number of 2s is at least 3. However, since I only have one, I might consider challenging if I think the other players are unlikely to have two more 2s combined. Alternatively, I can make a safer bid by increasing the digit to something higher where I have more cards, like '6' (I have two 6s). Bidding 3 6s is a higher bid than 3 2s (same quantity, higher digit) and is reasonable based on my hand.

Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. My hand is 82890014, which contains one 6. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I have one 6, it's plausible that there are at least three 6s in total. However, bidding more than 3 6s would require me to believe there's a high likelihood of other players having 6s. I can bid 3 7s, which is a higher digit with the same quantity, or increase the quantity. Given my hand doesn't directly inform me about other digits or players' hands, I'll play it safe and bid 3 7s, as there's no information suggesting a higher quantity is likely.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (21983237). For the bid to be true, there need to be at least two more 7s among the other 16 digits held by the other two players. This is statistically quite possible (expected number of any digit is 2.4), making a challenge risky at this low quantity. I need to make a higher bid. Options include 3 8s, 3 9s, or increasing the quantity to 4. I have two 2s and two 3s in my hand. I initially bid 3 2s. Raising the bid to 4 2s is a plausible step, requiring only two more 2s from the other 16 cards. This leverages my hand strength and my previous bid, putting more pressure on the next player than a simple digit increase like 3 8s.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 2s. Since I don't have any 2s, it's risky to challenge based on the assumption that the other players have at least 4 2s combined. Instead, I can make a safer bid by increasing the digit to 6s, which I know I have two of. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable increase from 4 2s, as it maintains the quantity but increases the digit.

Player 2 response was not valid JSON after cleaning: 'To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:

1. **Your Hand**: 82890014
   - Breaking down your hand: You have 2 eights, 1 two, 1 four, 1 zero, 1 nine. The digits and their counts are as follows: 0 (1), 1 (0), 2 (1), 3 (0), 4 (1), 5 (0), 6 (0), 7 (0), 8 (2), 9 (1).

2. **Current Bid**: 4 6s
   - The current bid is on the quantity of 6s, stating there are at least 4 sixes in total across all players.

3. **Your Observation**:
   - You have no 6s in your hand. This means that the 4 6s bid is entirely based on the other two players' hands.

4. **Analysis**:
   - Since you have no 6s, the total count of 6s across the other two players must be at least 4 for the current bid to be valid.
   - Given that each player has 8 digits, and there are 3 players, the total number of digits is 24. The maximum possible count for any digit (including 6) is 24.
   - The probability that two players collectively have at least 4 sixes can be considered. However, without knowing the other players' hands, we must rely on the bidding history and our hand.

5. **Bidding History**:
   - The bid history shows a progression from 3 2s to 4 2s and then to 4 6s, indicating an escalation in bids.
   - The fact that the bid moved from 3 7s to 4 2s and then to 4 6s suggests that players are trying to outbid each other with a higher quantity or a higher digit.

6. **Decision Making**:
   - To make a higher bid than 4 6s, you need to either bid the same quantity (4) with a higher digit or a higher quantity with the same or any digit.
   - The next higher digit than 6 is 7, 8, or 9. You can bid 4 7s, 4 8s, or 4 9s. 
   - You have 2 eights, which is a relatively strong presence of a digit in your hand. Bidding 4 8s seems plausible because it involves a higher digit (8 > 6), and you have some 8s.

7. **Action**:
   - Bidding 4 8s: You have 2 eights, so it's conceivable that the other two players together have at least 2 more eights, making 4 eights in total plausible.
   - Challenging 4 6s: Since you don't have any 6s, and it's possible for the other two players to have a total of 4 sixes between them, challenging might not be the strongest action unless you believe the bid is highly improbable.

Given the information and the need to make a decision, let's consider the options:
- **Bidding 4 8s**: This is a valid higher bid because 8 is greater than 6. You have 2 eights, so it's reasonable to believe the total count could be 4 or more.
- **Challenging**: Without strong evidence that 4 6s is an overbid (and given that you don't have any 6s), challenging might be risky.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 8 and no 6s in my hand (82890014). The bid of 4 6s implies there are at least four 6s across all hands. Given that I have no 6s, the other two players must have at least four 6s between them. While possible, it's a bit high. However, bidding higher on 6s or a higher digit is a viable strategy. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. A reasonable higher bid would be to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll consider a conservative increase. Bidding 4 7s is a valid move as it increases the digit. Alternatively, challenging is also an option but given the previous bids and the fact that the quantity hasn't been significantly escalated, I lean towards making a slightly higher bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (21983237), meaning the other 16 hidden digits must contain at least three 7s for the bid to be true. This is plausible, but not guaranteed. I have two 2s in my hand and have previously bid 3 2s and 4 2s, indicating strength in that digit. Instead of challenging 4 7s, which carries risk, or making a minimal bid increase like 4 8s, I can leverage my hand and bidding history. Bidding 5 2s is a strong move. It requires three more 2s among the other 16 digits. While this is slightly above the statistical average (1.6 expected 2s in 16 digits), it's a believable bid based on my hand and previous actions, and it significantly increases the pressure on the next player.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '2' in my hand. The current bid is '5 2s', which means there must be at least four more '2s' among the other two players' hands (since I only have one). Given that the bid history shows a pattern of increasing bids, but the current bid seems high for '2s', it's unlikely that there are five '2s' in total. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
