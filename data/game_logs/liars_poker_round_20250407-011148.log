Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to make the first bid. In my hand, I have two 3s, two 9s, two 0s, one 4, and one 6. Starting with a moderate bid, such as 3 3s, is reasonable because I already have two 3s in my hand, and it is likely that the other player has at least one 3 as well.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. My hand is 18294318. I have one '3', meaning the opponent needs at least two '3's for the bid to be true. This is plausible, making a challenge risky. I have two '1's and two '8's. Bidding based on my own hand is generally safer. A bid must be higher than 3 3s. Options include 3 4s, 3 5s, ..., 3 9s, or 4 0s, 4 1s, etc. Since I have two '8's, bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid only requires the opponent to have one '8' to be true, which is reasonably likely given they have 8 digits. This seems safer than challenging the 3 3s bid or bidding on a digit where I only hold one.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, making it less likely that there are at least 3 8s across both hands. The current bid of 3 8s seems risky and improbable, as I would expect to see at least one 8 in my hand for this bid to be plausible. Given this, I should challenge the bid.
