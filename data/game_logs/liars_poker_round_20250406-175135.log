Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 3, 5, 2, 4, 1, 1, 6, 9, which contains zero 0s. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, it's quite plausible that the opponent has at least one 0, so challenging now is risky. The minimal safe move is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity at 1. The next valid bid would be 1 1s, and since I have two 1s, bidding 2 1s is even stronger and more aggressive, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
