Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 2s and two 9s, which are the most frequent digits. Bidding 4 2s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely to be true and sets a baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 and one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 4 2s. Bidding 5 3s is a reasonable move because it increases the digit while keeping the quantity plausible, given the uncertainty of the other player's hand.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 3s. Since I only have two 3s, it's unlikely there are 5 or more 3s in total. Instead of bidding higher on 3s, I can try to increase the digit. Bidding 5 4s seems reasonable, as it increases the digit and I have one 4 in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 4S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 5 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have two 6s in my hand, which is a higher digit than 4. Bidding 6 6s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit and has a reasonable quantity given my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 6S'
Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, which means the total possible 6s in play is limited. The current bid of 6 6s seems unlikely given the lack of 6s in my hand. I should challenge this bid as it's improbable that there are 6 or more 6s in total.
