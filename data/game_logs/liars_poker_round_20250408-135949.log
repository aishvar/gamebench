--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 1s in my hand, which makes it unlikely that there are many 1s overall. However, the current bid of 3 1s is plausible since there are 16 digits in total across both players. To avoid challenging too early, I will bid higher. I have two 2s in my hand, so bidding 4 2s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit while staying within a plausible range.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. Since I don't have any 2s, I'm considering the likelihood that Player 1 has enough to make the bid valid. Challenging seems risky, but given that I don't have any 2s, it's possible that Player 1 doesn't have enough either. I'll challenge the bid.
