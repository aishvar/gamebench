Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '37542817', I have zero 0s. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, and there are 8 unknown digits in Player 0's hand, it's very plausible they have at least one zero. Challenging now would be risky. The minimal safe move is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, so I will bid 1 1s.
