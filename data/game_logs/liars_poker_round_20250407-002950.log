--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 9, one 3, one 8, one 6, one 1, two 2s. A safe and reasonable opening bid is '2 2s' because I hold two 2s myself, making it quite likely that there are at least two 2s total, and it sets a modest baseline.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 2s. Since I only have one 2, I cannot confidently bid higher on 2s. However, I can try to bid on a different digit that I have more of. I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding 3 5s seems reasonable, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 0, 9, 3, 8, 6, 1, 2, 6. I have zero 5s, so the current bid of 3 5s relies entirely on the opponent holding at least three 5s, which is unlikely given the distribution. Since I have zero 5s and the probability that the opponent has three or more 5s out of eight digits is low, challenging is the best move.
