Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 'None', I can make a bid with any quantity and digit. I have a 4 in my hand, and since the digit '0' is the lowest possible digit, I'll start with a reasonable bid of 1 0s to set the bar.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 1s, which is very low. I have a 1 in my hand, but I also have a 4, a 5, and a 9. Bidding 2 9s seems reasonable, as it increases both quantity and digit based on my hand.
