Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can start with any valid bid. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 6.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, so the bid requires at least one more 6 from Player 0. Raising to a higher digit (7s) reduces the likelihood of Player 0 having enough 7s, making this bid riskier for them to call. Bidding 3 7s shifts focus to a digit I have none of, increasing pressure without relying on my hand.

Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand, making it plausible that there are 3 7s in total. However, I have two 8s, which suggests that bidding 4 8s could be a strong move, increasing both the quantity and the digit. This bid is likely to be higher than the opponent's hand can support, making it a good strategic move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand has no 8s, meaning the opponent must have at least four. However, with only 8 digits in their hand, having four 8s is possible but risky. Challenging could win if they have fewer than four, which seems plausible given the bidding history and lack of 8s in my hand.
