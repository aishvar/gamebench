Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 95086014. I have two 0s, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. With 16 total digits in play (2 players * 8 digits), the expected number of 0s held by the opponent is 8 * (1/10) = 0.8. Therefore, the total expected number of 0s across both hands is 2 (my 0s) + 0.8 (opponent's expected 0s) = 2.8. Bidding '2 0s' is statistically sound, directly supported by my hand, and establishes a reasonable starting point for the bidding. It's a safe but assertive opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (26217887), I have no 0s. The opponent bid '2 0s', claiming there are at least 2 zeros total between both hands. Since I have zero 0s in my hand, this would mean the opponent needs to have at least 2 zeros in their hand of 8 digits. While this is possible, I have enough information to make a safer bid. I see I have three 7s in my hand, which means I can confidently bid '3 7s' - this is guaranteed to be true and is a valid higher bid than '2 0s' since 7 is a higher digit than 0.
