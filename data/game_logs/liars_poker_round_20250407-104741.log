Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the total digits are 16, and the current bid is only 1 zero, it's very likely there is at least one more zero across both hands. Therefore, challenging now is premature. The minimum higher bid is either 1 1s or 2 0s. I see that I have one 0 and one 1, so increasing to 1 1s is not necessarily stronger. Instead, I will increase the quantity to 2 0s, which is a reasonable and safe incremental bid given my own zero.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 90816235, I have exactly one '1'. The current bid is 2 1s, which is plausible since the opponent could have one or more 1s. It is early in the bidding, so challenging now would be premature. A safe way to increase the bid is to keep the quantity at 2 but move to a higher digit where I have good coverage. I have two 0s and two 8s, but since 0s have already been bid on, increasing the digit to 2 2s is invalid as it's a lower digit. Instead, I can raise the quantity to 3 for a digit I have multiple of. I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s is a reasonable next bid, leveraging my strong hand in 8s and increasing the quantity.
