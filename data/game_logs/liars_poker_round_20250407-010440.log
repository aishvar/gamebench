Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (47706261), I have: one 1, one 2, one 4, one 6, two 7s, and one 0. Since I have two 7s in my hand, that's a good digit to bid on. There are 16 total digits in play (8 from each player), so the other player could have more 7s as well. However, I should start with a conservative bid. I'll bid 2 7s since I know I have exactly that many in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. I could bid 3 0s, which is a safe increase. However, since I have one 7, bidding 3 7s is also an option. Or I could bid higher on another digit. I will bid 3 0s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (47706261), I see I have one 0 digit. The current bid is '3 0s', meaning my opponent is claiming there are at least 3 zeros total between our hands. Since I only have 1 zero, that means my opponent would need to have at least 2 zeros in their hand for this bid to be true. While this is certainly possible, I need to decide if I want to challenge or make a higher bid. Given that we're early in the game and 3 zeros is a reasonable claim, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 7s. I could bid '4 0s', but that's risky since I only have 1 zero. Instead, I'll bid '3 6s' since I have one 6 in my hand, and it's a higher digit than 0 while keeping the same quantity.

Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. The total number of digits is 16. Bidding higher than 3 6s without any information about the other player's hand is risky. I will bid 4 0s, increasing the quantity and hoping the other player doesn't have many 0s either.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '4 0s'. Looking at my hand (47706261), I have zero 0s. The opponent claims there are at least 4 zeros in total between our hands. Since I have none, all 4 would have to be in their hand. While possible, this seems somewhat unlikely given they have 8 digits total. However, I could make a higher bid. I have one 6 in my hand, and I previously bid '3 6s', suggesting I believed there were at least 2 more in the opponent's hand. I also have two 7s, which gives me more confidence. I'll bid '4 7s', which is higher than '4 0s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity.

Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. It's possible there are at least four 7s in total across both hands. I could bid higher, but I'm not confident. Considering the bid history, a jump from 3 6s to 4 7s seems a bit aggressive. I will challenge.
