Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand (28839316), I have: one 1, one 2, one 3, two 8s, one 9, one 6, and one 3. I should bid based on what I actually have to increase my chances of being correct. Since I have two 8s in my hand, that's a good digit to bid on. A conservative first bid would be '3 8s', suggesting there's at least one more 8 in my opponent's hand, which is reasonable. I could go higher, but starting conservatively gives me room to maneuver later.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, so the total number of 8s is determined by Player 0's hand. The current bid is 3 8s, meaning Player 0 must have at least three 8s. However, considering the possibility that Player 0 might be bluffing and only has two 8s, challenging the bid is a viable option. Since I cannot make a higher bid due to the distribution of digits in my hand, challenging is the best course of action to potentially expose a bluff.
