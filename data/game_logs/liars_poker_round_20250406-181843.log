Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. My hand is 16564717, which contains no 0s. Given that there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's, and I have none, the total count of 0s can be at most 8. The bid of 1 0s is quite conservative. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 0s, and the bid is already 1, I can reasonably bid higher on a different digit that I have more information about. I see that I have one 1, so bidding 1 1s is a reasonable and safe move as it increases the digit.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 2s. My hand is 16564717, which contains no 2s. I need to make a higher bid than 1 2s. The next higher bid can be either a higher quantity with the same digit or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I don't have any 2s, and there's only one 2 in the bid, I can safely assume that there's at most one 2 in total. I can bid 1 3s or higher. I have two other digits (6 and 1) that appear more than once, so bidding on a higher digit like 6 or 7 seems reasonable. However, I should start with a conservative bid. Bidding 1 3s is a safe start as it meets the condition of being a higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 4s. I have one 4 and one 6, and no other digits that are higher than 4 in large quantities. However, I can bid higher by increasing the digit. I will bid 1 5s, as it is a higher digit and still a relatively low bid.
