Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 0s, two 1s, one 2, one 3, and one 4. The most frequent digits are 0, 1, and 9, each appearing twice. A safe opening bid is usually 2 of a digit I have multiple of, as the total count across both hands is likely higher. I'll start with '2 9s' since I have two 9s and it's a strong, reasonable opening bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s. Since the current bid is 3 0s, it would require at least one 0 in the opponent's hand to be valid, which is plausible. Making a higher bid is safer than challenging now, as 3 0s is quite reasonable. I also have two 9s, so I can safely increase the quantity on 9s to 3, matching the current quantity but with a higher digit, which is a valid and strategic raise.
