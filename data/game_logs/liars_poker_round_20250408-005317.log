Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening bid and there is no current bid, I want to start with a conservative yet reasonable bid. In my hand, I have one 0, one 1, two 0s (positions 0 and 6), one 2, one 5, one 6, one 8, and one 4. The digit I have the most of is '0' with two occurrences. Assuming the opponent has a random distribution, starting with a bid of 3 0s is a safe and reasonable opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s, which is a very low quantity for any digit. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 4 9s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 50286104, I have zero 9s. Since there are 16 digits total, for the bid of 4 9s to be valid, the opponent must likely have all 4 or more 9s, which is improbable. Given that I have none, the chance of there being at least 4 total is quite low. Therefore, challenging seems the best move.
