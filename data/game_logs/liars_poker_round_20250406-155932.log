Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. My hand contains two 2s, two 5s, one 3, one 4, one 7, and one 9. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, reflecting the two 5s I hold. This is a conservative yet credible starting bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current game state. I have 8 digits in my hand (88100625), and there's one '5' in my hand. The current bid is '2 5s', which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 2 fives in total between our hands. Since I already have 1 five, this claim is very likely to be true - Player 0 would only need to have 1 or more fives in their hand. Given this information, challenging would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, one 0, one 1, one 6, one 2, and one 5. The most common digit in my hand is 8 (two of them), so I could bid '3 8s', which would require Player 0 to have at least one 8 to be true. Alternatively, I could play it safer and bid '2 6s' or '2 8s', which would be higher than '2 5s' because of the higher digit. Since I have two 8s in my hand, bidding '3 8s' seems reasonable.

Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 5, 7, 2, 2, 4, 5, 3, 9. I have zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, which means the opponent claims there are at least three 8s among all 16 digits. Since I have zero, all three would need to be in the opponent's hand, which is unlikely as the expectation is roughly 1.6 of any digit per hand. The probability of the opponent having three or more 8s is low. Therefore, challenging is a good strategic move.
