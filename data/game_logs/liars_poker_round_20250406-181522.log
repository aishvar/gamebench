Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have a 7 in my hand and a 5. I notice that the current bid digit is 8, which is higher than my hand digits. However, I can make a reasonable bid by increasing the quantity to 4 and selecting a digit that is higher than 8, which is 9. This seems like a safe bet based on my hand.
