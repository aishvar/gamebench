Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s and two 7s. Bidding 2 5s or 2 7s is a safe starting point, as it's likely that the other player also has at least one of these digits, making the total count plausible.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have a 5 in my hand, meaning there is at least one 5 in play. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable increase, and I have no strong reason to believe it's a lie. Bidding a higher digit with the same quantity feels riskier without knowing the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 5s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 7s, bidding 4 7s seems reasonable, increasing both the quantity and the digit based on my hand.

Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 7s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 9, and 4 9s is a plausible bid, I will bid 4 9s. This is a reasonable increase in digit without a huge increase in quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, and the current bid is 4 9s. Given that there are only 16 total digits in play, it's unlikely there are 4 or more 9s. I should challenge the bid.
