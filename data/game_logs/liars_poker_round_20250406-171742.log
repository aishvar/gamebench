Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding 2 5s seems like a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I need to make a higher bid. Since my hand contains a 6, 7, 8, and 9, I could potentially have a higher count of a specific digit than the current bid. I will bid 3 6s as my hand contains a 6 and I can reasonably assume there's a chance the other player might have some lower digits, making my bid potentially valid and higher.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 4 6s is a safe increase. I could also bid a different digit, but increasing the current bid is the most straightforward approach.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is the best option. My hand contains the digits 7, 4, 1, 6, 8, 3, 2, and 9. I have one 6 in my hand. Given that the bid is 4 6s and I only have one 6, I should consider if bidding higher is feasible or if challenging is more likely to succeed.
