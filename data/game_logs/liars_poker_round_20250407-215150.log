Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand (6,0,9,5,7,1,3,3), I notice I have two 3s. Bidding on the digit 3 with a quantity of 4 is a strategic choice. This bid assumes the opponent has at least two 3s, making the total 4. It's a moderate bid that balances risk and potential reward, encouraging the opponent to either challenge or raise the bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s, meaning there are claimed to be at least three 4s across both hands. Looking at my own hand (53819862), I have zero 4s. Since I hold none, the entire claim depends on the opponent having all three or more 4s, which is statistically unlikely given only 8 digits. The probability that the opponent has three or more 4s is quite low, so challenging is a strong strategic move here rather than making a higher bid without any 4s myself.
