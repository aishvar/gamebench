Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make the first bid. I have a total of 8 digits in my hand, with a good spread of numbers. I can confidently bid 2 6s, as I have two 6s in my hand, which seems reasonable to start the game.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (45306223). For the bid to be true, the opponent needs at least one 6 in their 8-digit hand, which is statistically likely (expected value 0.8). Challenging seems risky. I should make a higher bid. I have two 2s and two 3s. Bidding based on my strong suits is a good strategy. Bidding '3 2s' is a valid higher bid (quantity 3 > quantity 2). This bid requires the opponent to have at least one 2, which is plausible given they have 8 digits. This seems safer than challenging or bidding on digits I don't possess.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 2s. Since I know I can at least account for one of those, I should increase the bid to reflect that. I can bid 4 2s, which is a valid higher bid than the current one.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have two 2s in my hand (45306223). For the current bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least two 2s. Player 0 raised my previous bid of 3 2s to 4 2s, suggesting they might have 2s or are bluffing based on my bid. Challenging feels risky as needing two 2s from the opponent is plausible. I need to make a higher bid. Options include increasing the quantity (e.g., 5 2s) or keeping the quantity and increasing the digit (e.g., 4 3s). I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 4 3s requires a total of four 3s across both hands, meaning the opponent would need to have at least two 3s. This is a plausible scenario, similar in likelihood to the current bid of 4 2s. Bidding 4 3s is a safe, incremental increase based on my hand, putting the pressure back on the opponent.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s and one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 4 3s, which means Player 1 is claiming there are at least 4 threes among both players' hands. Given that I only have one 3, I suspect that Player 1 may be overstating the count of threes. Instead of making a higher bid, I will challenge the current bid, as it seems unlikely that there are 4 threes in total.
