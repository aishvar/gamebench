Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, two 5s, two 1s, one 6, and one 8. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, reflecting the two 5s in my hand, which is likely conservative given there are 16 digits in total.
