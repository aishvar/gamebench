Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and the current bid is only 1 0s. Since I can bid at least 2 8s, I will increase the quantity while keeping the digit the same. I will bid 2 8s, which is a valid higher bid than 1 0s.
