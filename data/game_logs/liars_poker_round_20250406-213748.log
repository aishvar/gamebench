Round setup complete. Starting bids.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 5s, and one each of 0, 6, 7, 3, and 9. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, as I already have two 5s myself, making it quite likely there are at least two 5s in total.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s, which would require the other player to have at least one more 5. Given that I only have one, it's uncertain if the total is two or more. Challenging seems risky but necessary to test the validity of the bid.
