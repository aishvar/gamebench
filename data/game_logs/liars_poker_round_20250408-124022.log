Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have the digits 7, 0, 3, 0, 8, 4, 2, and 5. Digit '0' appears twice in my hand, making it the digit I'm most confident about. Since there is no current bid, starting conservatively with a low-risk bid seems prudent. I'll bid '2 0s' because I already have two, and it's highly probable that my opponent has at least one more.
