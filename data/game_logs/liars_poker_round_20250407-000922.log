Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative opening bid. I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding '2 5s' seems like a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand has two 0s and one 5. The current bid is 2 5s. Bidding 3 0s increases the quantity while using a digit I already have multiple of. This maintains pressure while being partially grounded in my visible hand. Challenging seems risky since opponent likely has at least one 5 (meeting their bid).

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. I can raise the bid to 3 1s, or 4 0s. Since I have a 1 in my hand, I will bid 3 1s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 1S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one '1'. The current bid is 3 1s, meaning the opponent must have at least two 1s for their bid to be valid. Given there are only 8 unknown digits in their hand and digits are 0-9, the probability of them holding exactly two 1s is relatively low. Since the average expected number of 1s in their hand is less than one (0.8), challenging offers a reasonable chance of success as the total count might be 2 or less.
