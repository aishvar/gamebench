Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s and two 2s, which are my strongest counts. Starting conservatively, I will bid 2 6s, reflecting my hand and leaving room to escalate.

Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have two 3s in my hand, which is a higher quantity than the current bid. Bidding 3 3s is a valid and strategic move to increase the quantity while keeping the digit lower.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s and no 3s. Since the current bid is 3 3s and I have zero 3s, the likelihood that there are at least three 3s total depends entirely on Player 1's hand. For Player 1 to support that bid, they would need at least three 3s themselves, which is possible but somewhat unlikely. However, instead of challenging now, I can safely increase the bid based on my strong count of two 6s. A natural and safe raise is to bid 3 6s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit), leveraging my known hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s. While I don't have enough information to challenge with high confidence, I can make a reasonable bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, as I have no 7s, 8s, or 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s seems like a strategic move.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 6s and two 7s, so I personally have two 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, meaning the opponent claims there are at least three 7s total. Since I hold two, it is quite reasonable that the opponent has at least one 7, making three plausible. To safely increase the bid, I can bid 3 8s (same quantity, higher digit) or 4 of any digit. I don't have many 8s or 9s, but I do have two 6s, so bidding 4 6s is more justified based on my hand. Therefore, I will raise the quantity to 4 and revert to a digit I have strong evidence for.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are 4 6s in total, as that would mean the other player has at least 3 6s, which is improbable given the bid history. Challenging seems like the best move.
