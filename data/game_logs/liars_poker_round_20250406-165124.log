Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 0s, one 2, one 8, one 6, and one 7. The most common digits in my hand are 3 and 0, each appearing twice. A safe opening bid would be 2 3s or 2 0s, but to be slightly more aggressive and increase pressure, I will open with 3 3s, hoping that between both hands there are at least three 3s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. I could bid 3 4s, but I have two 4s and two 5s. Bidding 4 4s seems like a slightly stronger move than just incrementing the digit, and still plausible. It also gives me some wiggle room if the other player has a few 4s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits: 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 8, 6, 7. I have zero 4s, so the entire count of 4s depends on my opponent's hand. The current bid is 4 4s, implying there are at least four 4s among the combined 16 digits. Given I have none, my opponent would need to hold all four or more 4s, which is unlikely as it would mean half their hand consists of 4s. Statistically, that is improbable. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
