Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one each of digits 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, which suggests no digit dominates. It is standard to open with a conservative bid of 2 of a digit I have, like 2 0s or 2 1s. Choosing 2 0s as my opening bid is reasonable because I hold one 0, so the chance that at least one exists in the opponent's hand is high.
