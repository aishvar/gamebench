Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand, giving me a solid basis to believe that there are at least three 3s across both hands. With no current bid, establishing a bid around my strongest digit puts pressure on my opponent while remaining plausible given the expected distribution of digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider my hand and the possibility of having a higher quantity or digit. My hand contains the digits: 1, 2, 1, 4, 7, 7, 0, 2. I have two 7s and two 2s, and one 1, one 4, and one 0. I also have two 1s but no 3s. The current bid is 3 3s, so I should think about bidding higher than 3 or bidding a higher digit if I can. A reasonable bid seems to be 4 2s or 4 7s since I have two of these digits.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand, 63317348, contains only one 7. The current bid of 4 7s requires that there be at least three additional 7s among the opponent's 8 digits, which is statistically very unlikely given a uniform distribution of digits. Therefore, I believe the bid is too high and should be challenged.
