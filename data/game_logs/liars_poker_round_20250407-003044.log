Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (20765439), I have one 9. Bidding 1 9s is the safest and most reasonable starting point, as it's the highest digit I have and there's a chance the other player might not have a 9, making it a valid and conservative opening bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which is already higher than what I can confidently bid based on my hand. Since I only have one 8, it's unlikely there are three 8s in total. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
