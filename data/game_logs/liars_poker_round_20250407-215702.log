Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits: 4, 9, 0, 8, 8, 3, 6, 1. The most frequent digit I have is '8', appearing twice. Statistically, it's reasonable to open with a conservative but credible bid of 2 of a digit I have multiple of. Therefore, I will bid '2 8' to start the game with a solid base.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. My hand contains no 8s, so I cannot make a higher bid for 8s. Since the maximum possible 8s across both hands is 2 (as I have none), the current bid is already at the maximum possible value. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
