Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 7, one 8, and one 3 (so two 3s in total). Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 3s, reflecting my two 3s, which is a safe and credible opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand, which makes the current bid of 2 3s valid. However, I can increase the bid to 3 3s, which is a reasonable move since I have the digits to support it. This maintains the same digit while increasing the quantity, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 3. The current bid is 3 3s, which means there must be at least three 3s in total across both hands. Since I only have one, my opponent would need at least two 3s for their bid to be valid. While it's possible, it's not guaranteed, and challenging now could be risky. Instead, I can make a safe higher bid based on the digits I hold. I notice I have two 0s, so bidding 3 4s or 3 5s wouldn't be informed. However, I also have two 3s, 2s, 1s, 0s, 4, 7, and 8, but only one 3. To increase the bid, I can bid 3 4s (higher digit, same quantity), which is a minimal but valid raise and doesn't overcommit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand, which means there is at least one 4 present. The current bid is 3 4s. To make a valid higher bid, I can bid 4 4s, which increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same. This seems reasonable given I have a 4.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand '32104783', I have one '4'. The current bid is 4 4s, meaning there must be at least four '4's across both hands. Since I have only one, the opponent would need to have at least three '4's for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution of digits, having three or more '4's in a single hand is unlikely. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
