Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s, two 9s, and one 0 in my hand. Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make a valid initial bid. Bidding 2 5s seems reasonable as I have enough to support this bid, and it sets a baseline for future bidding.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, but I do have two 6s. The current bid is 2 5s, so I can safely increase both the quantity and the digit by bidding 3 6s, which is a valid higher bid based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s and one 9 in my hand, but the current bid is 3 6s. Since I have no 6s, I cannot support the current bid and it seems unlikely that there are enough 6s in total. I should challenge the last bid.
