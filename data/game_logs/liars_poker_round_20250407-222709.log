Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, and since the current bid is none, I can start with a minimal bid. Bidding 1 9s is safe because the total must be at least 1, making the bid valid regardless of the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s. I can see that my hand contains the digits 8, 6, 0, 2, 4, 8, 3, 7. There are no 9s in my hand. Given that there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand, and the bid is on 9s, it's possible that the opponent has at least one 9. However, to make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 9s, I will increase the digit. Bidding 1 0s is a valid higher bid because 0 is greater than 9 is not true, but it's a valid bid if we consider the quantity remains the same and we can bid on a different digit. However, a more reasonable approach is to increase the quantity. Thus, bidding 2 9s is a valid and reasonable action as it increases the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s, which would require Player 1 to have at least one more 9. Given the uncertainty and the potential for a bluff, challenging is a reasonable move.
