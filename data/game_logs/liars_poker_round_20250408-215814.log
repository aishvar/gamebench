Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have no 4s in my hand, so the total count of 4s could be up to 8. However, challenging seems risky because if Player 0 has 2 or more 4s, they win. Considering the low bid and my lack of 4s, challenging might be a good move to test the validity of the bid.
