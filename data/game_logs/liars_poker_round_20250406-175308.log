Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one 0, so the current bid of 1 0s is very likely true. To raise, I can either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity on a higher digit. I also have two 8s, which increases the chance that there are multiple 8s between both hands. Therefore, a safe and strategic higher bid is 2 8s, which is a minimal increase over the current bid and based on my strong hand in 8s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s and two 9s. The current bid is 2 9s, which I can already fully account for with my own digits. Since Player 0 is naive, they might have guessed or have one 9, but I cannot challenge because the bid is definitely plausible given my hand alone. A safe and strategic move is to increment the quantity or digit. I will raise to 3 8s, as I already hold two 8s, making it quite likely with Player 0's hand to reach or exceed three 8s.
