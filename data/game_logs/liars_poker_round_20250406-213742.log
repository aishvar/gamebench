Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 68067974. I can see that I have two 6s and one 7. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. Bidding on 6s seems like a good start since I have two of them. I'll bid 2 6s as it's a conservative start and reflects some information from my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Considering the total possible digits, it's uncertain if there are two 6s. Challenging this bid could be a strategic move to test the validity of the bid.
