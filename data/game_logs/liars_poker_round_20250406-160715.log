Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. My hand contains two 7s, two 9s, one 5, one 4, one 0, and one 6. Starting with a conservative but credible bid, I will bid 2 7s, as I hold two 7s myself, making this bid guaranteed true and a solid opening.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 05829483. The current bid is 2 7s. I need to make a higher bid (more than 2 7s) or challenge. I have zero 7s, so challenging is risky; Player 0 could easily have two 7s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 2 8s is a safe, valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). However, bidding 3 8s is also a valid higher bid (higher quantity). Since I hold two 8s already, it's statistically probable that there is at least one more 8 among the 8 digits held by Player 0. Therefore, bidding 3 8s is a strong bid based on my hand and puts more pressure on the opponent.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, which requires at least three 8s in total across both hands. Since I have zero, all three would have to be in my opponent's hand of 8 digits, which is unlikely as the probability of exactly three 8s in 8 digits is relatively low. Therefore, I believe the bid is an overstatement and challenging is the best strategic move.
