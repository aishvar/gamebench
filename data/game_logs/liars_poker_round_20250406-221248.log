Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. In my hand, I have two 5s and three 2s. Starting with a safe but competitive bid, I will bid 2 2s, leveraging the fact that I have three 2s, making this a conservative yet strong opening.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I hold two 3s in my hand and the current bid of 2 2s can be safely outbid by switching to 3s. Bidding '2 3s' leverages the strength of my hand without increasing the quantity unnecessarily, forcing my opponent to either challenge or raise further.

Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 2s and zero 3s. The current bid is 2 3s, which implies there are at least two 3s among both hands. Since I have no 3s, the opponent would need to have both 3s. This is possible but somewhat unlikely. However, challenging now might be premature because two 3s is not an unreasonable bid. Instead, I can increase the bid based on my two 2s, which is safer for me. The next higher valid bid would be 2 4s (higher digit, same quantity) or 3 2s (higher quantity). Since I have two 2s, bidding 3 2s is reasonable, as it only requires the opponent to have at least one 2, which is likely.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I only have one 2 in my hand and the current bid requires a total of 3 2s. For this bid to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least 2 2s out of 8 digits, which is statistically unlikely (roughly an 18.7% chance). Given that challenging now would win about 81% of the time, it is my best move.
