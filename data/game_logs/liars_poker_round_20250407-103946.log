Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, it is very likely that there is at least one more zero in Player 0's hand, or at minimum, the current bid is safe. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or the digit. I have two 4s and two 8s, which are strong digits to bid on. Bidding 2 4s would be a safe and reasonable next step, as I already hold two 4s myself, making it very likely the bid is valid.
