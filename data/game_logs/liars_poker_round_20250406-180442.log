Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. Given that I have a 0 in my hand and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I can safely assume that there is at least one 0 in Player 0's hand. However, I don't know if there's more than one 0 in total. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. The current bid is quite low, so I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I have multiple digits in my hand that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. I see that I have two 6s and other digits, but I don't have any 1s. A reasonable next bid could be to increase the quantity or the digit slightly. I will bid 2 1s as I don't have any 1s but I do have other digits that could make a strong bid if I had them.
