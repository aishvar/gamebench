Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid. I have the hand 17234617. I have two 1s and two 7s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. A safe opening bid should be based on my hand. Bidding '2 7s' is a reasonable starting point, as I possess two 7s myself. This bid is likely true and forces the opponent to make a higher bid or challenge a relatively safe claim.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, which guarantees that there are at least two 8s in total. Since the current bid is 2 7s, I can safely raise the bid by keeping the quantity the same but promoting to a higher digit, making my bid both valid and backed by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand (17234617). For the bid to be true, the opponent must have at least two 8s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, challenging is an option. However, I can make a relatively safe higher bid based on my hand. I have two 1s. Bidding '3 1s' requires only one 1 from the opponent's 8 digits, which is statistically plausible (expected number of 1s across 16 digits is 1.6). This leverages my hand information and forces the opponent to make a tougher decision. Bidding '3 7s' is also possible as I have two 7s, but bidding on 1s diversifies from my previous bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I only have one '1' in my hand, so for the current bid of 3 1s to be true, the opponent would need to have at least two 1s in their 8 unknown digits. Given the probability of that happening is quite low, the bid seems unlikely. Therefore, I should challenge.
