Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 84355034, I have: two 5s, one each of 8,4,3,0, and no 1s,2s,6s,7s,9s. Since this is the opening bid and I have two 5s, bidding '2 5s' is a safe starting move. It's conservative enough to be likely true even if my opponent has no 5s, while establishing a reasonable baseline for future bidding.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '5' in my hand (from 91318768). The current bid is 2 5s, which means Player 0 is claiming there is at least one more '5' in their hand. This is plausible since there are 8 unseen digits in their hand. I can either bid higher or challenge. A higher bid would need to be at least 3 of any digit or 2 of a higher digit. Since I have two '8's in my hand, I can make a safe bid of 2 8s, which is a higher digit than 5 at the same quantity.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand and know the current bid of '2 8s' is already true based on my hand alone. I could safely increase the bid, but since I also see two 5s in my hand and the total possible count of any digit is 16, I believe bidding '3 5s' would be a strong strategic move. This forces my opponent to either bid higher or challenge, while keeping the quantity manageable.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand (from digits 91318768). The current bid is 3 5s. Since I have a strong hand with 8s, I can increase the bid by raising the digit to 8 while keeping the quantity the same. This is a safe move that maintains pressure without overcommitting.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand and the opponent bid '3 8s'. Given the bid history shows increasing confidence in 8s from the opponent (2 8s -> 3 8s), they likely have at least one 8. With my one 8, their likely 1-2 8s, and only 16 total digits in play, '3 8s' is a reasonable bid. I could bid higher, but I see I have three 5s in my hand. Since I know these 5s exist for certain, bidding '4 5s' is a safer play than challenging or bidding higher on 8s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand (from 91318768). The current bid is 4 5s, which means Player 0 would need at least 3 more 5s in their hand to make this bid valid. Given that the probability of them having exactly 3 more 5s is low, and considering the bid history shows a pattern of increasing 5s, it's unlikely the total count is actually 4 or more. Therefore, I should challenge.
