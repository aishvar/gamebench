Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have one '6' in my hand, so bidding '1 6s' is a safe starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. The current bid is 1 6s. Bidding 2 2s increases the quantity while leveraging my existing pair, ensuring the total count (at least 2 from my hand) meets the bid. This is safer than challenging a low bid that might still be valid if the opponent has a single 6.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one '2' in my hand. The current bid is '2 2s'. Since I only have one '2', it's unlikely that there are two '2s' in total unless the other player also has one. Given that the bid is relatively low, I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Bidding '3 2s' would be too risky since I only have one, so I'll challenge.
