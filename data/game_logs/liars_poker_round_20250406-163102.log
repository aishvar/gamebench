Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since I am the first bidder and there is no current bid, I want to start with a conservative but reasonable opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 5, one 7, two 8s, one 9, one 6, and one 1. The most frequent digit in my hand is two 8s. Given there are 16 total digits, it's reasonable to expect at least three 8s between both hands. Therefore, I will open with a safe bid of 3 8s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity of the same digit. This bid is likely to be believable given the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (70569158), I have two 8s. The current bid is 4 8s, so for that to be valid, there would need to be at least two more 8s in Player 1's hand. Since each player only has 8 digits, and 8s are less common than lower digits, expecting half of their digits to be 8s is unlikely. The probability that Player 1 holds 2 or more 8s, given I have 2, is low. Therefore, challenging the bid is strategically sound.
