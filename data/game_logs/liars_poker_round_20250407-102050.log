--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 6s, two 7s, one 8, and one 9. A conservative but reasonable opening bid would be 2 of a digit I have multiple of. Choosing 2 6s leverages the two 6s in my hand, making it plausible and setting a baseline for the bidding.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s and two 7s. The current bid is 2 7s, which I know is already matched by my hand alone, so challenging would be unwise. To increase the bid, the minimal legal bid is 2 8s or 3 of any digit. I have two 3s as well, so bidding 3 3s leverages my hand strength and is a safe increment.
