Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game. My hand contains two 8s, one 2, one 1, one 7, one 9, one 5, and one 4. Since each player has 8 digits, total digits are 16. A conservative but reasonable opening bid based on my hand is 2 8s, reflecting my two 8s. This sets a baseline without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s and one 9. The current bid is 2 9s, which I know is at least partially supported by my single 9. Given there are 16 digits total, it's plausible the opponent has at least one 9, making the current bid reasonable and risky to challenge. To continue strategically, I can increase the quantity to 3 while choosing a digit I have strong evidence for: since I hold two 8s, bidding 3 8s is a safe incremental raise that pressures my opponent without overcommitting.
