Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 0s, one 7, one 4, one 1, and one 5. Starting with a conservative and statistically reasonable opening bid, I will choose a digit where I have at least two copies to give me some confidence. I'll bid '2 9s' because I already hold two 9s, making it likely that there are at least two in total.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, so for the current bid of 3 0s to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least two 0s. Given that on average each digit appears about 1.6 times per hand, it's plausible but not certain. However, I also have three 9s, which supports a strong bid. Since my previous bid was 2 9s, and the opponent jumped to 3 0s, I can now safely increase the bid to 3 9s, which is a higher bid (same quantity, higher digit), leveraging my strong count of 9s.

Calculating action for Player 1 (Naive 50/50)
Player 1 (Naive) chose to BID: 4 0s
Player 1 (Naive 50/50) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. The current bid is 4 0s, which means there would need to be at least 3 more zeros in Player 1's hand. Since 0s are relatively rare and I only have one, it is unlikely Player 1 has three or more zeros. The probability that there are at least 4 zeros total is quite low, making this a good spot to challenge.
