Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the opening bid, so I want to start with a conservative but credible bid. Looking at my hand 18386319, I have two 1s, two 3s, two 8s, one 6, and one 9. Since I hold two 8s, and 8s tend to be strong opening digits, I'll start with a modest bid of 2 8s, reflecting my hand and leaving room to maneuver.
