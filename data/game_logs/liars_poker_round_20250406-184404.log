--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, but I do have two 2s and two 7s. The current bid is 2 5s, which is quite low, and it's highly likely that there are at least two of many digits across both hands. To safely increase the bid, I can bid 2 7s, which is a higher digit at the same quantity, supported by my two 7s.
