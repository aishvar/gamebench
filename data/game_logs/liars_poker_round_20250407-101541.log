Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 7, 9, 5, 2, 7, 7, 8, 4. I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Since I have three 7s, a safe and strategic higher bid would be 3 7s, which increases both the quantity and digit significantly beyond the opening minimal bid.
