Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible, but not guaranteed. Since it's the very first bid and quite low, it's very likely there is at least one 0 in the combined 16 digits. Therefore, challenging now is risky. The best strategic move is to make a minimal higher bid by either increasing the digit or the quantity. I have two 4s and two 4s is a solid base to bid on. So, I will increase the quantity to 2 and bid on 4s, which I know I hold.
