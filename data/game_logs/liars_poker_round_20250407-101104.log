Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I want to start with a conservative yet credible bid based on my hand. My digits are 3, 1, 2, 7, 9, 0, 7, 8. Counting them, I have two 7s, one 3, one 1, one 2, one 9, one 0, and one 8. Since I have two 7s, starting with a bid of 3 7s is reasonable, implying I expect at least one 7 in the opponent's hand, which is likely given random distribution.
