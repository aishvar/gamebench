Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a reasonable bid based on the digits in my hand. I have one 6, one 5, and one 4. Bidding 2 6s is a safe starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 6.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 26327374, I have one 6. The opponent bid '2 6s', claiming there are at least 2 sixes total. Since I have one 6 and there are 8 more unknown digits in the opponent's hand, this is a very reasonable bid. Rather than challenge, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have three 7s, which gives me high confidence to bid '3 7s' - this is valid as it uses a higher digit than 6 while keeping the same quantity.

Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have a 7 in my hand, so it's possible that there are 3 7s in total. However, I also have two 9s, which is a higher digit. Bidding 4 9s seems like a reasonable move to increase both the quantity and the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (26327374), I have no 9s. The opponent bid 4 9s, which means they would need to have at least 4 nines in their hand since I have none. While possible, this seems unlikely given there are only 8 digits in their hand. Additionally, their previous bid of 2 6s was quite conservative (I can see I have one 6), suggesting they may be bluffing now with this aggressive 9s bid. Given this analysis, challenging seems like the best option.
