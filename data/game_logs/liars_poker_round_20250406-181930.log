Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 0 in my hand (48457131), so the total count of 0s is at least 1. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 1 1s is a valid higher bid as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 2s. I can see that my hand contains one 1 and no 2s. Given that there's at least one 1 (the one I bid previously) and now a bid on 2s, it's reasonable to continue with a higher bid. I will bid on a higher digit to reflect a potentially higher total count. Bidding 1 3s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 4s. I can see my own hand: 48457131. It contains one 4. Given that there's one 4 in my hand, it's likely there's at least one more 4 in the other player's hand because the current bid is 1 4s made by the other player. I should increase the bid. Bidding 2 4s is a safe start as it increases the quantity. I can always reassess after the next player's move.
