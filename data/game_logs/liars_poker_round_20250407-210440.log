Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is '1 2s'. I have no 2s in my hand. The naive player likely bid this randomly. It's early in the game, so the chance of there being only one 2 across both hands is relatively low, but not impossible. However, since I have no 2s, I'd rather bid something else that I have. I have two 7s. I will bid '1 7s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 2s. I have one 7 in my hand. I can bid 1 7s, which is higher than 1 2s. Alternatively, I could bid 2 2s, but I don't have any 2s. I could also bid 1 of any number higher than 2. Since I have a 7, bidding 1 7s seems like a safe and valid move.
