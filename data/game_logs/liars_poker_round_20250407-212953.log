Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening move and there are no bids yet, I need to start with a reasonable initial bid. Looking at my hand (72250583), the digit '2' appears twice, '0' once, '5' twice, '7' once, '8' once, and '3' once. A common strategy is to bid on a digit I hold multiple times, as I know at least those counts are present. The digit '2' appears twice in my hand, so a safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 twos ('2 2'), indicating I believe there are at least two '2's in total. This is a conservative and strategic start.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 twos. Looking at my hand (7, 4, 1, 7, 6, 6, 1, 0), I have zero 2s. Since I have none, all twos must be in Player 0's hand. It is possible but somewhat unlikely they have both twos, but not impossible. Given the total of 16 digits, a bid of 2 twos is plausible, but I have no evidence to confidently increase the bid. Raising to 3 twos would be risky as I have zero. Alternatively, I could bid 2 3s, which is the same quantity but a higher digit. Checking my hand, I have zero 3s, so that would also be risky. The safest move is to challenge the current bid, suspecting Player 0 may be bluffing about having two 2s.
