Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 4s, two 0s, one 7, and one 8. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 4s, as I already hold two 4s myself, making it likely true or easily defensible.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand and the current bid is 2 4s. Since I know there is at least one more 4 in total (from my hand), I can safely increase the bid. I can bid 3 4s, which is a valid higher bid than the current one.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 4s (digits: 8,3,0,7,3,4,4,2). The current bid is 3 4s, which exactly matches what I hold, so the opponent could have zero or more 4s. Since it is risky to challenge a bid that matches my own count, and increasing the bid slightly is safe, the minimal valid raise is 3 5s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This keeps pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, and the current bid of 3 5s seems high considering the total digits in play. Given that the previous bids were low (2 4s and 3 4s), I suspect the count of 5s is less than 3. Therefore, I will challenge the current bid as it seems unlikely to be valid.
