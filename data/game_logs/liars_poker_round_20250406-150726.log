--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. In my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 7, one 3, one 7, one 4, one 8, and one 9. I have two 7s, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. It is standard to start with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, so I'll bid 2 7s, reflecting my hand strength and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (since my digits are 66117546). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. Increasing the quantity to 3 7s seems reasonable because I know there's at least one 7 in my hand and one in the opponent's hand. However, bidding 2 8s is also an option as it increases the digit. Given that I have no information about the distribution of other digits, I'll choose to increase the quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7. The current bid is 3 7s, which would require at least two 7s in the opponent's hand to be valid. Since I only have one 7, it's somewhat unlikely the opponent has two or more 7s among their eight digits. The probability of that is low enough to justify challenging the bid rather than risking an unlikely higher bid.
