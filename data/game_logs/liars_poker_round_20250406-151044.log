Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one each of digits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. A conservative and reasonable opening bid is 2 of a common digit. Choosing '2 5s' is sensible because 5 is a middle digit and likely to appear at least twice across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have one 5 in my hand (from 57643610). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I see one 5, it's plausible there could be at least 2 5s in total. I will increase the quantity to 3. To be more conservative and not overbid, I'll stick with the same digit, 5. Thus, bidding 3 5s is a reasonable move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (8 5 7 3 6 4 2 9), I have one 5. The current bid is 3 5s, which means across both hands there must be at least 3 fives. Since I only have one and the opponent likely has at most two, the bid is plausible but not certain. Bidding 3 6s is risky since I only have one 6. However, I could reasonably increase the bid by quantity instead. Given the distribution, it's safer to bid 4 of a digit I have more of. I have one 8, one 5, one 7, one 3, one 6, one 4, one 2, and one 9â€”no multiples. So, the best move is to increase the quantity on the same digit to 4 5s, which is the minimal valid raise.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have information about the exact count of 5s or higher digits in the opponent's hand, I'll analyze my hand. I have digits 5, 7, 6, 4, 3, 6, 1, 0. I see one 5 and two 6s. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit and keeps the quantity the same, and I have some information supporting the existence of two 6s in my hand. Alternatively, I could bid 5 5s, but that assumes the opponent has at least one more 5. Given the information I have, bidding 4 6s seems like a safe and reasonable next step.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (85736429), I have exactly one 6. The current bid is 4 6s, meaning there must be at least four 6s across both hands. Since I only have one 6, Player 1 would need to have at least three 6s for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution of digits and the total of 8 digits on their side, having three or more 6s is possible but statistically unlikely. Therefore, challenging is the best move here.
