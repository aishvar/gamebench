Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 4, one 7, one 9, one 8, and one 5 â€” essentially one of each digit except 3 and 6. Opening with a conservative bid on a digit I possess is reasonable. I'll start with '2 8s' because I hold one 8, and it's likely the opponent has at least one more, making this bid plausible and safe as an opener.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I can see that I have one 8 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have information about the other player's hand, I'll play cautiously. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, which means that my opponent claims there are at least three 8s in total. Since I hold two, it's plausible they have at least one 8, making the bid reasonable. Challenging now is risky. A safe and strategic move is to increase the bid minimally. I will raise the digit to 3 9s, which is the smallest valid higher bid.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (from 76118498), so there are 7 other digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand. The total count of 9s could be at least 1 (mine) and potentially more if the opponent has some. Bidding 4 0s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity and is a lower digit, making it somewhat plausible given the total count of digits. I'm not confident the opponent has more than one 9, but I can try to pressure them with a higher quantity bid on a different digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains one 0. For the current bid of 4 0s to be valid, there would need to be at least three 0s in the opponent's hand, which is unlikely given the distribution of digits. The probability of the opponent holding three or more 0s out of eight digits is low, making the current bid suspicious. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
