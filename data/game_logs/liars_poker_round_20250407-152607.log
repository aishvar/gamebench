--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 3, one 9, one 8, one 4, one 6, another 8, one 1, and one 4. So, I have two 4s and two 8s. A safe opening bid is to start with a quantity likely supported by my own hand, such as 2 8s, which I know to be true. It's a reasonable starting point without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have two 8s in my hand, so the total count of 8s could be as low as 2 if the other player has none. Challenging this bid is a calculated risk, as if the total is exactly 2, I win. If the other player has any additional 8s, I lose. Given the potential for a low total, challenging seems viable.
