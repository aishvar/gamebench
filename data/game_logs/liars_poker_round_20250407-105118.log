Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game, and I have three 0s, one 4, one 5, one 7, two 3s in my hand. Statistically, since there are 16 digits total, the average count per digit is about 1.6. Given I hold three 0s, it's likely there are at least 4 or more zeros in total, making a conservative opening bid of 3 0s quite safe.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 0s and no 1s. The current bid is 3 1s, which I find unlikely because I have zero 1s and there are only 8 unknown digits. Statistically, expecting 3 or more 1s in the other hand is improbable. I believe challenging here is the best move.
