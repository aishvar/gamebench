Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (10745646), I have one 0. Since the current bid is 1 0s, I know there is at least one 0 overall. With 8 unknown digits in Player 0's hand, it's quite likely there could be another 0, so raising to 2 0s is reasonable. Alternatively, I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity at 1. I have two 4s and two 6s, so bidding 2 4s or 2 6s would be a stronger, safer bid based on my hand. I'll bid 2 6s, leveraging my strong holding of two 6s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s and one 7. The current bid is 2 7s, which is plausible since I hold one 7 and the opponent might have one or none. To overcall, the safest higher bid would be 3 6s because I already have two 6s, so only one more 6 is needed across both hands, which is likely. This bid increases the quantity and reverts to a digit I have strong representation of, making it a solid strategic move.
