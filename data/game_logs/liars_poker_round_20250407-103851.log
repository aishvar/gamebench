Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. I could bid 3 0s since I have two 0s, but that's only slightly better than the current bid. I could also bid 3 of any other digit. Since the current bid is low, I will bid slightly higher to test the waters and see if the other player challenges. I will bid 3 5s.
