Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there's no previous bid to base my decision on, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 12430309, I notice that I have two 0s, two 1s, two 3s, and one 2, one 4, and one 9. Since I have to make a bid that is strictly higher than 'None', I should start with a digit I have at least one of and a reasonable quantity. Starting with a low quantity and a digit I have in my hand seems like a safe approach. I will choose a digit and quantity that reflects my hand's composition without revealing too much information.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 3s in my hand. The opponent's bid of 2 3s requires them to have at least two 3s in their 8-digit hand for it to be valid. Given the statistical probability of holding two specific digits in an 8-card hand is relatively low (~18% chance), challenging is a high-risk/high-reward move. While bidding 3 6s (based on my three 6s) would be safe, the favorable odds of the opponent bluffing or miscalculating make a challenge strategically preferable here.
