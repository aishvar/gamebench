Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 8, and one 5. The most common digit in my hand is '5', appearing twice. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 5s, reflecting my hand and leaving room for escalation.
