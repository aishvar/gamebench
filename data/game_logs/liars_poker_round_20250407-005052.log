Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (08212749), I see that I have two 2s. Bidding 2 2s is the safest and most reasonable starting point, as it is based on the actual digits in my hand and sets a baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have two 6s and one 7 in my hand. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable move as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 6s. Since the maximum possible 6s in play is 2 (from the other player's hand), the current bid is highly unlikely. Challenging is the best option.
