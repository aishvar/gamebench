Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. It's likely there's at least one 0 in the other player's eight digits. I'll open with 3 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, making it less likely that there are at least three 0s across both hands. However, it's not impossible, as Player 0 might have multiple 0s. To stay in the game, I will make a higher bid. I have two 4s in my hand, so bidding 4 4s is a reasonable step up from the current bid of 3 0s, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 4s in my hand, so the opponent would need four or more 4s in their eight digits for this bid. That seems very unlikely. I'll challenge.
