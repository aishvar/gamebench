Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (09590513), I see I have two 0s, one 9, one 5, one 9, one 5, one 1, and one 3. I can start by bidding on a digit I have. Since I have two 9s, bidding '2 9s' seems reasonable as it's a digit I have in my hand and it's a conservative start.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 2 9s, so there need to be at least two 9s across both hands. Since I have one, the opponent needs to have at least one 9 for the bid to be valid, which is plausible. Making a minimal higher bid is safer than challenging now because the bid is quite conservative. The next valid bid options are 3 0s through 3 9s or 2 10s, but digit 10 is invalid. The smallest sensible raise is 3 9s, leveraging the fact that I already have one 9, making it somewhat plausible.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, so the total count of 9s is at least 1 (mine) plus the count in Player 1's hand. Player 1 must have at least 2 9s to make the bid. It's possible they have more. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Bidding 4 0s would be a reasonable increase in quantity and a decrease in digit, but I can also consider increasing the digit. I have two 5s, so I know there are at least two 5s. However, bidding 3 5s is not an option since it's not higher than 3 9s. I can bid 4 5s. Let's analyze: Bidding 4 9s seems too high since it implies both players have at least 4 9s. However, bidding 3 0s or 4 0s/4 1s/4 2s etc., is possible if I think there's a reasonable chance of that digit appearing more times. I have one 0 and one 1, and no 2s, 3s, or 4s. Given my hand and the current bid, I will bid 4 0s, as it is a reasonable increase in quantity and a decrease in digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (97881623), I have zero 0s. The current bid is 4 0s, which means the opponent claims there are at least four zeros across both hands. Since I have none, all four zeros would have to be in their hand of eight digits, which is quite unlikely statistically. The expected number of zeros per hand is less than one, making four zeros in total improbable. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
