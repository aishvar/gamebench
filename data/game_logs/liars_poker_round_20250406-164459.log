--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 'None', I can make any bid I want. I'll start by bidding on a digit that I have a good chance of having in my hand, which is 1. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding 3 1s seems reasonable.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (89496846), I have no 1s, which makes me doubt there are 3 or more 1s across both hands. Since I have zero 1s, the entire count of 1s depends on the opponent's hand. The chance that the opponent has all 3 or more 1s out of their 8 digits is quite low. Therefore, challenging the bid is a strategic move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
