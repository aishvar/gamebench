Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my first turn. I should start with a conservative bid to test the waters. Analyzing my hand '26877914', I have a total of 3 '7's, 2 '2's, and 1 each of '6', '8', '9', '1', and '4'. A bid of '1' of any digit is a good starting point since it's hard to challenge a bid of 1 without knowing the opponent's hand. I choose digit '7' as it's one of the higher counts in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my first turn. I should make a conservative bid to test the waters. My hand contains two 7s, two 9s, and one of each of the other digits. A bid of '1' for any digit is a good starting point, but I should consider a digit that has a higher chance of being present in my opponent's hand as well. Since there's no information about my opponent's hand, I'll choose a digit that appears in my hand and is likely to appear in a random hand. The digit '7' appears twice in my hand, making it a reasonable choice.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 sevens. In my hand, I have one 7. For the bid to be valid, there must be at least two 7s across both hands. Given I have one, the opponent plausibly has at least one, which is quite reasonable. Therefore, challenging now would be risky. To stay in the game strategically, I should raise the bid. The minimal valid raise would be to increase the digit while keeping the count the same, such as bidding 2 8s, since I have one 8 and the chance opponent has another is reasonable. Alternatively, increasing the quantity on 7s to 3 could be risky without more 7s on my side. Thus, the safest strategic move is to bid 2 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Analyzing the current bid of '2 8s' made by Player 1, I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is the best option. Given my hand '26877914', I count 3 occurrences of the digit '8'. Since the current bid is '2 8s', I can potentially make a higher bid by increasing either the quantity or the digit. The maximum possible quantity for any digit in our hands is 16. I have 3 '8s', and without knowing Player 1's exact hand, I must consider if bidding higher is strategic or if challenging is more prudent. If I bid '3 8s', I am making a valid higher bid because I have at least 3 '8s' in my hand, which directly competes with Player 1's bid of '2 8s'.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (74382532), I have two 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, which means the opponent claims there are at least three 8s total. Since I have two, this implies the opponent likely has at least one 8. This is plausible, making a challenge risky. To continue, I can make a minimal valid raise by increasing the count of 8s to 4, or by bidding 3 of a higher digit (9s). However, 4 8s would require the opponent to have at least two 8s, which is less probable. Alternatively, I can increase the digit with the same count. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s as well. Bidding 3 9s would be speculative; instead, raising to 4 3s is less supported as I only have two. The safest minimal raise is 3 9s, but with no 9s in my hand, it is a bluff. Given that, challenging now is safer since 3 8s is plausible but 4 8s is unlikely. Therefore, the optimal move is to challenge the current bid.
