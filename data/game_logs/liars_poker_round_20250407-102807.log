Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s ('10005832'). Since the current bid is only 1 0s, and I already hold two, it is very likely there are at least two 0s in total, and possibly more in Player 0's hand. Therefore, a safe and strictly higher bid is 2 0s.

Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 2 1s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one '1'. The current bid is 2 1s, so for it to be valid, there must be at least one more '1' in Player 0's hand. This is plausible, making a challenge risky. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or the digit. Since I have three '0's, a confident next bid would be 3 0s, which is a higher quantity and leverages my strong count of zeros.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 1s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one '1' and three '0's. The current bid is 3 1s, which requires at least three '1's across both hands. Since I only have one '1', the opponent would need at least two '1's for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution of digits and the fact that I have a significant number of other digits, it's somewhat unlikely the opponent has two or more '1's. Additionally, since I have three '0's, a safer bid would be to increase the quantity of '0's to 4, which is likely valid given my hand. Therefore, I will raise the bid to 4 0s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 0s
