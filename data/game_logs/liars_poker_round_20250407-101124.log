Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or keep the quantity and raise the digit. Since I have two 9s, a strong digit, making a bid of 2 9s is both safe and strategic. This bid is higher because it increases the quantity from 1 to 2 and changes the digit to 9.
