Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand (38477120), I have: one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, two 4s, one 7, and one 8. My most frequent digit is 4, which appears twice in my hand. Since I don't know what the other player has, I'll make a conservative bid based on what I know for certain. I could bid '2 4s' since I already have two 4s in my hand, making it a guaranteed safe bid. However, starting with a very low bid gives my opponent too much room. I'll bid '3 4s', assuming there's a reasonable chance my opponent has at least one 4 in their hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 95951603, I have no 4s but three 5s. Since the current bid is 3 4s, I can reasonably increase the bid to 3 5s, which is a legal strictly higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This is a safe incremental raise based on my strong count of 5s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '3 5s'. Looking at my hand (38477120), I don't have any 5s. Since there are only 16 total digits in the game (8 in my hand, 8 in my opponent's hand), and I don't have any 5s, there can be at most 8 fives in the game (all in my opponent's hand). The current bid is only claiming 3 fives, which is quite reasonable and likely to be true. I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, which gives me confidence to bid on 7s. I could bid '3 7s' (same quantity, higher digit) or increase the quantity. Since I have two 7s myself, I'll bid '3 7s' which is a safe bid that's higher than '3 5s'.

Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s, one 5, one 6, one 0, one 3, and no 7s. Since I have zero 7s, for the current bid of 3 7s to be valid, the opponent must have at least all three 7s, which is somewhat unlikely given random distribution across 8 digits. The probability that the opponent has exactly three or more 7s is low. Therefore, challenging the bid is a reasonable strategic move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bid of 3 7s.
