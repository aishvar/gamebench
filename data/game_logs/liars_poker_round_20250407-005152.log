Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have my 8 digits: 26699071. Looking at the frequencies in my hand: two 6s, two 9s, and one each of 0,1,2,7. Since I'm making the first bid, I should bid conservatively but based on what I know I have. Bidding '3 6s' is reasonable since I already have two 6s in my hand, and there's a decent chance the opponent has at least one more 6.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 6s (digits are 3, 8, 5, 1, 3, 9, 4, 5). Since I have zero 6s, for the current bid of 3 6s to be valid, my opponent must have all three or more 6s in their hand of 8 digits. Statistically, this is unlikely. Given the low probability and my complete lack of 6s, I will challenge the bid.
