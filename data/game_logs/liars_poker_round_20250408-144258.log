Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (amazon/nova-pro-v1), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '1 0s', which is the minimum possible bid. Given my hand (93171258), I don't have any 0s. However, since the bid is minimal, it's likely that Player 0 is being conservative. I can safely make a higher bid without much risk.

--- Turn: Player 1 (amazon/nova-pro-v1) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (amazon/nova-pro-v1), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have a 3 in my hand, but I also have two 2s, which were the subject of the previous bid. The naive player has been incrementally increasing bids, which suggests they may not have a strong hand. Given the incremental nature of their bidding, challenging seems risky as they might have at least three 3s. Therefore, a safe move is to bid 4 2s, which is a higher quantity of the previous bid digit and aligns with the digits I hold.
