Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, I know there are already at least two 0s in total. It is very likely there are even more 0s in Player 0's hand, but even if not, I can confidently raise the bid to 2 0s without much risk. This is a safe incremental bid that pressures Player 0 to either challenge or bid higher.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one '1' (from '02253474'). The current bid is 2 1s, which is plausible since I have one and the opponent could easily have another. To increase the bid, I can choose a digit with strong presence in my hand. I have two '2's and two '4's, so bidding 3 2s or 3 4s is a safe and reasonable next move. Since '2's have a slightly stronger expected count across both hands, I will bid 3 2s to increase the quantity and select a digit I hold multiple of.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 2s

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 3s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 3. The current bid is 3 3s, meaning there must be at least three 3s across both hands. Since I only have one, Player 0 must have at least two or more for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution of digits and the fact that each digit appears roughly 1.6 times on average (16 digits / 10 digits), expecting three 3s is plausible but somewhat unlikely unless Player 0 has a strong concentration of 3s. However, since Player 0 is a naive player, they might have overestimated. The safer strategic move here is to challenge, as the probability of there being three or more 3s is relatively low given my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (Naive 50/50) bid of 3 3s.
