Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 86025553, I notice that I have three 5s. Since the goal is to make a bid that is likely to be true but also strategic, bidding on the digit 5 seems like a good starting point. Given that I have three 5s and considering the total number of digits in play (16), it's reasonable to assume there could be at least 4 fives in total, especially since my opponent's hand is unknown. Thus, a bid of 4 5s seems like a balanced choice, aiming to set a benchmark without overestimating.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand (61428041) contains no 5s, so I have no support for the current bid of 4 5s. With only 8 digits on the opponent's side, the probability that they hold at least 4 5s is extremely low. Challenging this bid is the best move given the unlikely chance that there are 4 or more 5s in total.
