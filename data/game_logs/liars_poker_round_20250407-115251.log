--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 9, one 8, two 7s, one 4, one 3, one 1, and one 2. The most common digit in my hand is 7, appearing twice. A conservative but reasonable opening bid would be 2 7s, reflecting my hand strength while not overcommitting early.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 44213506, which contains one '7' digit (none). The current bid is 2 7s, meaning there must be at least two 7s across both players' hands. While I don't have any 7s, it's reasonable that Player 0 might have at least two 7s, or at least one, making the bid plausible. I can't confidently challenge yet. Instead, I can make a slightly higher bid in a digit I have multiple copies of. I have two '4's in my hand, so bidding 3 4s seems safer and reasonable, as it increases quantity and moves to a digit I hold strongly.

Player 1 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s, which is plausible if the opponent has two or more 4s, but not guaranteed. To make a safe higher bid, I look for digits where I have strong holdings. I have two 7s, so bidding 3 7s is valid and strictly higher than 3 4s (since the digit is higher). This is a reasonable incremental bid based on my hand's strength.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 44213506, meaning I hold digits 4,4,2,1,3,5,0,6 and no 7s at all. The current bid is 3 7s, and I don't have any 7s myself. For the bid of 3 7s to be valid, the opponent must have at least three 7s alone, which is possible but somewhat unlikely given the total of 8 digits per player. However, since the opponent increased their bid from 2 7s to 3 7s, they might indeed have multiple 7s. Without having any 7s myself, it's risky to raise the bid to 4 of any digit without strong evidence. Given the uncertainty and the opponent's willingness to increase the bid specifically on 7s, it seems safer to challenge the current bid rather than risk making a higher uncertain bid.
