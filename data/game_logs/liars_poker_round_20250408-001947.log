Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have multiple 8s, which is a good starting point. With 3 eights in my hand, bidding 3 8s seems reasonable and not too high to be suspicious.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, making the total number of 8s dependent on Player 0's hand. The bid is 3 8s, which requires at least three 8s in total. Given the average probability, it's more likely that Player 0 has fewer than three 8s. Challenging is a strategic move as it's probable the bid is false.
