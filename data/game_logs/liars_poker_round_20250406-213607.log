Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. Since it's the first bid, I can choose any quantity and digit. Bidding 3 2s is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the current bid of None and considers the possibility that the other player might have one 2.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I don't have any 2s in my hand. I could bid 3 3s, but I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 4 9s seems like a reasonable move, increasing both the quantity and focusing on a digit I have.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, and I have one 9 in my hand. Challenging this bid is reasonable since it's unlikely for there to be four 9s in total given the limited number of digits.
