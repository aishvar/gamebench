Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s and no 8s in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, which seems low considering there are 16 digits in total. I will bid 3 6s, which is a higher quantity and a higher digit than the previous bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid since 8 is greater than 6. Given that I have two 8s, if Player 1 has at least one, the bid will hold. This seems like a reasonable move based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s and two 3s in my hand, but no 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, which seems unlikely since there are only 16 total digits and Player 0's previous bids indicate they might not have many 8s either. I believe I can challenge this bid as it seems too high given the situation.
