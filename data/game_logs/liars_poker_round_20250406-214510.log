Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 7s, one 8, one 9, one 3, and one 2. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be 2 7s, as I already hold two 7s myself, making it likely that there are at least two 7s in total.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s and one 8. The current bid is 2 8s, which is plausible given my single 8 and the opponent potentially having one or more. Challenging now is risky. To stay in the game and make a safe, incremental bid, I can increase the quantity to 3 while sticking with a digit I know I have multiple of: 7. So, I will bid 3 7s, which is a valid higher bid.
