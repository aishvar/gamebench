Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. I have two 0s in my hand, which is a good starting point. Bidding 2 0s is a safe and reasonable initial bid, as it's likely there are at least two 0s in total when considering both players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 2 7s is valid since it maintains the same quantity but increases the digit, ensuring the bid is higher. The total count of 7s will be at least 2 (from my hand), making the bid safe.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 7s. Since I only have one 7, it's unlikely that there are two 7s in total. However, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity and choosing a digit I have more of. I have two 0s, so bidding 3 0s is a safe and valid move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. My hand contains 1 zero. To meet the bid, the opponent must have at least 2 zeros. With only 8 digits in their hand, the probability of them having 2+ zeros is low. Challenging is likely advantageous given the low expected count of zeros across both hands.
