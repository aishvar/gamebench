Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0, so the current bid of 1 0s is certainly valid. Since there are 16 digits in total, it's highly probable there are at least two of some common digit. Looking at my hand, I also have two 1s. Therefore, a safe and natural higher bid would be 2 1s, increasing the quantity by one and choosing a digit I have multiples of, making it a strong, reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 0, 6, 5, 3, 4, 1, 8, 1. I have zero 2s, so the current bid of 2 2s relies entirely on Player 0 having both 2s, which is somewhat unlikely but plausible. Since I have two 1s, a safe and natural next bid would be 2 3s, but that doesn't beat 2 2s. To raise, I can either bid 2 3s or higher, or increase the quantity. I don't have any 2s, so it's risky to raise on 2s. Instead, I can bid 2 8s, since I have one 8, and with 16 digits total, two 8s is reasonable. This is a minimal overbid that keeps me in the game.
