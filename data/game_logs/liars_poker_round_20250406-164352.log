Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s, one 8, and one 0 in my hand. Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable opening bid based on the digits I have. Bidding 3 5s is a safe and logical choice, as I already hold two 5s and it's likely there is at least one more 5 between both players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 82677813, I have a total of 3 fives and one 8, and other digits do not appear more than once or twice. I can see if I increase the quantity or the digit, I can make a reasonable bid. The current bid is 3 5s, I can make a bid of 3 6s or higher quantity with a lower digit, or a higher digit with a similar or lower quantity. I have two 6s and two 8s, so bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, which makes it less likely that there are at least 4 6s across both players. Since the current bid is 4 6s and I find it improbable based on my hand, I should challenge the bid.
