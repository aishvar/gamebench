Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 5s, two 3s, one 7, and one 6. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, reflecting my two 5s and leaving room to escalate later.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 30576025, I have one 6. The current bid is 2 6s, so at least one more 6 is needed in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. This is quite plausible given 8 unknown digits. Rather than challenge now, a safe and strategic move is to raise the bid. Since I have two 0s, increasing the quantity and changing the digit to 0s is reasonable. I'll bid 3 0s, as it's a modest increase leveraging my own hand strength.
