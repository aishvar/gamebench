Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand, making it a safe bet to bid 2 1s. This is a low-risk move as the total will be at least 2, even if the opponent has none. It's a strong starting bid without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 2 1s and examining my hand 49519968, I notice I have one 1 and several other digits. Since the bid is low and I only have one 1, it seems plausible that the total count of 1s could be at least 2 across both players' hands. However, without knowing the other player's hand, I must consider the likelihood of higher bids. Given my hand does not contain any digit more than twice, and considering the low current bid, I can try to increase the bid by quantity or digit. A safe increase would be to bid on a digit I have more of or the same digit with a higher quantity. Since I have two 9s, which is a higher digit, bidding on 9s could be strategic. However, directly bidding on the quantity of a digit I have less of (like 9) might not be the best strategy without more information. Considering the balance between risk and potential gain, and given that I have two 9s which is a significant presence of a high digit, I should consider if the current bid is challengeable or if I should make a bid that is reasonably higher and based on the information I have.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, but considering the rules that each digit appears exactly 8 times across both players, the total number of 9s is 8. Since the current bid is 2 9s, which is valid, and I cannot challenge without losing, the best move is to bid higher. Bidding 3 9s is a safe move as the total is 8, which is more than 3.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 9s and my hand of 49519968, I notice I don't have any 9s. However, considering the bid history, Player 0 has already bid 2 1s and then increased to 2 9s and now 3 9s. This indicates they might have a strong hand in 9s. Since I don't have any 9s and the bid is already at 3 9s, challenging seems like a reasonable option because if Player 0 is bluffing, I could win. On the other hand, making a higher bid requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. Given my hand, increasing the digit to a higher number than 9 is not possible, and increasing the quantity of 9s without having any in my hand seems risky. Thus, challenging the current bid of 3 9s appears to be the safest and most strategic move, as it forces the reveal of the total count of 9s without committing to a potentially false bid.
