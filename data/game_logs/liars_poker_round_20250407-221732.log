Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open with a reasonable starting bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 9s, two 0s, one 4, one 5, and one 6. The most common digits in my hand are 3s, 9s, and 0s, each appearing twice. Opening with a conservative but credible bid based on these counts makes sense. I will start with '3 3s' as an opening bid, which is reasonable given my two 3s and the likelihood that the opponent has at least one 3.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I don't have any 3s in my hand. Since I have 8 digits, the maximum total number of 3s could be 16. However, the current bid is relatively low. I will make a slightly higher bid to probe the other player. I will bid 4 4s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 4, 6, 5, 9, 9, 3, 3, 0. There is only one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 4 4s, meaning there must be at least four 4s total across both hands. Since I only have one, the opponent would need to have at least three 4s, which is quite unlikely given the distribution. With 16 digits in total, the expected count for any digit is roughly 1.6, so four 4s is already a stretch. Therefore, I believe challenging is the best move here.
