Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no prior bids, I need to start the bidding. In my hand, I have two 7s, two 8s, and one 9. Starting with a reasonable bid based on my hand, I will bid 3 7s, as it is a safe and plausible opening bid given my hand and the likelihood of additional 7s in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (52681713). For the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) needs to have at least two 7s. While possible, a bid of 3 is relatively low early in the game. Challenging is an option, but it feels slightly risky as Player 0 having two 7s is plausible. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s. Bidding 4 1s is a valid higher bid (increasing the quantity from 3 to 4). This bid is supported by my hand, as I possess half the required quantity myself. Player 0 would only need two 1s for my bid of 4 1s to be correct. This seems like a stronger and safer move than challenging the low bid of 3 7s or making a minimal bid like 3 8s (where I only have one 8).

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have no 1s in my hand, which makes it less likely that there are 4 or more 1s across both hands. However, it is still plausible given the total of 16 digits in play. Instead of challenging, I will make a higher bid based on my hand. I have three 7s, which makes a bid of 5 7s reasonable as it increases the quantity and aligns with the strength of my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (52681713). This means for the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least four 7s in their 8-digit hand. While Player 0 has bid 7s twice (3 7s, then 5 7s), requiring four specific digits out of eight seems statistically unlikely. The jump from 3 7s to 5 7s could be an aggressive bluff, especially after I bid 4 1s. Given that I only contribute one 7, the burden on the opponent's hand is high. Therefore, challenging seems like the most prudent move.
