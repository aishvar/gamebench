Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 6s. Since I only have one, Player 0 must have at least two for the bid to be valid. However, without knowing their hand, it's uncertain. Challenging is a viable option as the bid may be a bluff.
