Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding one '0' is a safe starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 zero across both hands. Looking at my own hand (75694634), I have zero zeros. Since I have no zeros, the entire validity of the bid depends on whether Player 0 has at least one zero. It is quite probable that Player 0 has at least one zero among their eight digits, as the chance of zero zeros in 8 digits is (9/10)^8 â‰ˆ 43%, so more than half the time they will have at least one zero. Therefore, challenging now is risky. The safest move is to increase the bid incrementally. The natural next bid is to increase the digit from 0 to 1, keeping the quantity at 1, which is valid and minimal.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is '1 1s'. I have two 0s and two 1s in my hand. To make a valid bid, I can either increase the quantity of 1s or bid a different digit with a quantity of at least 1. Since I have two 0s, I can confidently bid '2 0s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 1s. I have two 0s and two 1s in my hand. I could bid 2 1s. Since I have two 0s, I could also bid 2 0s. I will bid 2 0s to increase the bid and potentially mislead the other player since I have two 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 zeros. Looking at my hand (7,5,6,9,4,6,3,4), I have zero zeros. Since I hold half the digits and have none, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have both zeros in their hand, which is unlikely but possible. However, zeros are generally less common, and with me holding none, the chance that the opponent holds two zeros out of eight digits is relatively low. Therefore, it's a good strategic moment to challenge the bid rather than risk raising it on a weak basis.
