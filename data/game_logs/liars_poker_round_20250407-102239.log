Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, but since the current bid is only 1 0s, it is very likely that at least one 0 exists across both hands. Challenging now would be unwise. To increase the bid, I can choose a digit I have multiple copies of to make a stronger position. I have three 5s and two 3s and two 8s. A safe and strategic raise would be to bid 3 5s, leveraging my strong count of 5s.
