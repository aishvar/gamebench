Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. An optimal opening bid usually targets a digit I hold multiple times to establish a credible baseline. In my hand, the digit '0' appears 3 times (positions 4, 6, and 8). This is a strong basis for an initial bid because with 3 zeros myself, it's statistically likely there are more zeros in the opponent's hand. Therefore, I will open with a conservative but credible bid of 3 zeros.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. Given my hand (14978566), I have 1 0. I can make a valid bid by increasing the quantity or switching to a different digit. Since I have a 1 0, I can bid on a different digit that I'm certain will be higher than the current bid. I notice that I have a 4, 7, and 5, which are all higher than 3. I also have a 9, which is the highest digit in my hand. I'm not certain about the quantity of other digits, so I'll make a bid that increases the quantity of a digit I'm certain about. I'll bid on the digit 9, which is the highest in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. Given the maximum possible quantity is 16, it's unlikely there are 3 zeros across all players' hands. I'll challenge the current bid.
