Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I can see two 1s, two 9s, two 0s, one 5, and one 2. The current bid is only 1 0s, and since I have two 0s myself, I know there are at least two 0s in total, possibly more. Therefore, I can confidently raise the bid to 2 0s, which is a strictly higher bid and well-supported by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 15991201, I have three 1s. The current bid is 2 1s, so I know there are at least three 1s in total. Since the minimum total is already above the current bid, it would be risky to challenge. A safe and strategic move is to increase the quantity of 1s to 3, which is supported by my hand alone. This forces my opponent to either bid higher or challenge a truthful bid.

Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 15991201, the digit counts are: 1 (two times), 2 (one time), 0 (one time), 5 (one time), 9 (two times). The current bid is 3 2s, and since I have only one 2, Player 0 would need at least two more 2s in their hand to make the bid valid. Given that the average expectation for any digit across 16 total digits is around 1.6, having three 2s total is plausible but not very likely. Since Player 0 is a naive bidder, their bid may be more optimistic than accurate. Therefore, challenging now is a reasonable decision.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (Naive 50/50) bid of 3 2s.
