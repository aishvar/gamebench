Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 0s (digits: 0,5,6,7,2,9,0,3), so I already see at least 2 zeros myself. Since Player 0 only bid 1 zero, I know with certainty there are at least two zeros in total. Therefore, the current bid is safe to raise. The minimal valid raise would be to 2 0s, which is guaranteed true. Alternatively, I could consider raising to 1 of a higher digit, but since I have two zeros, the safest and most strategic move is to raise the count on zeros to 2.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Player 0's current bid is 2 ones. Looking at my hand (05672903), I have zero '1's. Since I have no '1's, and the total digit count is 16, all '1's must be in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. It is unlikely Player 0 holds both '1's, especially since naive players tend to bid conservatively or incrementally. The previous bid was 2 zeros, which I supported because I have two zeros myself. Player 0 then shifted to '2 1s', perhaps bluffing. Given I have zero '1's, and the prior bids, I strongly suspect Player 0 does not have two '1's, making the current bid improbable. Therefore, the optimal move is to challenge.
