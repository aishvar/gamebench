Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. The current bid is 1 0s, which is quite low and easily believable since I already have one 0 myself. It is very likely that at least one 0 exists in the other player's hand as well, making a challenge unwise. The next minimum legal bid must increase either the digit or the quantity. The easiest minimal raise is to bid 1 1s (same quantity, higher digit). Alternatively, I could raise the quantity to 2 0s, which is also quite reasonable given I have one 0 and expecting at least one more in the other hand. Statistically, 2 zeros in 16 digits is very plausible. Therefore, I will bid 2 0s to increase the quantity conservatively.

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 2, 7, 3, 5, 5, 4, 0, 6. I do not have any 1s. The current bid is 2 1s, which means the opponent is claiming there are at least two 1s across both hands. Since I have zero 1s, all 1s would have to be in Player 0's hand. The probability that they hold two or more 1s out of their 8 digits is relatively low, making their bid somewhat risky. Therefore, challenging this bid is a good strategic move.
