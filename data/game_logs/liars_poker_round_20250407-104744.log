Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have the digits 5, 8, 0, 1, 6, 9, 8, 4 in my hand, which includes one 0. Since the current bid is 1 0s, there is at least one 0 (mine). It is very likely there is at least one more 0 in the opponent's 8 digits, so bidding 2 0s is a safe incremental raise. This is the minimal valid higher bid, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same.
