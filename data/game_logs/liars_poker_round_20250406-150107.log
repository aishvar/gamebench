Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that other players have at least one 6.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6. With 24 total digits among all players, and knowing only about my single 6, the bid of 4 6s would require at least three more 6s across the other two players' combined 16 digits. Statistically, each digit appears roughly 2.4 times in total, so four 6s is plausible but not guaranteed. Since the bid is relatively conservative and within expected probability, challenging now is risky. Therefore, I will make a higher but still reasonable bid by increasing the digit to 7 while keeping the quantity the same, as I have two 7s in my hand, making it plausible there are at least four 7s total.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider my hand and the possibility of higher digits or quantities. My hand contains a 6, 3, 1, 9, 5, 8, and 3, 1, and 0 are not present. I see a potential for increasing the quantity or the digit. Given that I have two 8s and one 9, and considering that the maximum possible quantity for any digit could be 24, bidding 5 8s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and digit compared to 4 7s.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have no 8s in my hand, which makes this bid seem unlikely. Given that there are only 24 digits in total across all players' hands, having 5 8s is improbable. Therefore, I should challenge this bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) challenges Player 2's (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bid of 5 8s.
