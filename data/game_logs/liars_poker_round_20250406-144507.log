Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 70581849, which contains 1 '0', 2 '8's, and other digits. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and a common digit. I have two 8s, so bidding on '8' is a good start. A quantity of 3 for '8's seems like a safe initial bid considering there are 4 players and 32 digits in total.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 4 8s is a logical next step, as it increases the quantity while maintaining the same digit. It's a reasonable bid given my hand and the current state of the game. I don't want to challenge immediately, as it's possible someone else has 8s as well.

Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 2 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid as the digit 9 is higher than 8. I have one 9 in my hand, and while the total count of 9s might be lower than 4, shifting the bid to a higher digit reduces the risk of being challenged immediately. This move forces others to either risk challenging or escalate further.

Player 2 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s, which makes the current bid of 4 9s unlikely unless other players collectively hold at least 4. Given an average expected count per digit is about 3.2 (32 digits / 10 digits), bidding 4 9s is already slightly above the mean. Since I see zero 9s, the chance that the other three players collectively have 4 or more 9s is low. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 2's (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bid of 4 9s.
