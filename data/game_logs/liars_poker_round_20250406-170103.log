Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: With no current bid, I should start by bidding a digit that I'm confident I have. In my hand, I have two 8s. Bidding 2 8s seems reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable increase, and I have a chance of it being true. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit, but I don't have many of any other digit. Since I have one 8, I'll increase the bid on 8s. I could also challenge, but 2 8s isn't outrageously high.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s. I should bid 4 8s, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. Given the bid history shows an increasing trend, and I have no information about the other player's hand, it is likely they have at least one 8. However, 4 is a significant number considering there are only 16 total digits. I will challenge the bid, as it seems improbable that there are four 8s given my hand and the previous bids.
