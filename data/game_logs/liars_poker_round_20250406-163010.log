Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: There are no bids yet, so I can start with a reasonable bid. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s is a safe starting point, as it's likely there are at least three 6s in total between both players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 5, 4, 3, 3, 1, 9, 7, 7, which contains zero 6s. Since the total number of digits is 16 and I have none, the opponent would need all 3 or more 6s in their hand to make the bid true. This is unlikely, as it would require them to hold at least 3 of 8 digits as 6s, which is improbable. Given my zero count and the low likelihood of the opponent holding 3 or more 6s, challenging is the best move.
