Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (Random(openrouter/meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor)), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, and there are no bids in the history. I will start by bidding on a digit that is likely to have a high quantity, which is 9. My hand contains two 9s, so I have a good chance of winning this bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (Random(openrouter/meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor)), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current state of the game and my hand, I should start by bidding on a digit that appears frequently in the cards. The digit '9' appears twice in my hand, making it a good starting point. I'll bid on the digit '9' with a quantity of 2.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of 9 2s. In my hand (14431565), I have 0 twos. This means the opponent would need to have 9 twos in their hand for the bid to be valid. Since each player has 8 digits total, it's impossible for my opponent to have 9 twos. Even if all 8 of their digits were 2s (which is unlikely), the total would be 8 twos at most. Therefore, the bid of 9 2s must be invalid and I should challenge it.
