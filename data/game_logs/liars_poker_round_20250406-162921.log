--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder with no current bid, I want to start with a conservative yet credible opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, two 5s, two 9s, and two 3s. Choosing a digit I have multiple of increases the likelihood that there are more in total between both hands. I will open with a bid of 3 5s, since I already have two 5s, making it likely there is at least one more in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s and one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. Bidding 4 3s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 43594254, I have no 3s at all. Since there are 8 digits in my opponent's hand, for the bid of 4 3s to be valid, all 4 or more 3s would need to come from their hand entirely, which is statistically unlikely. Given that I have zero 3s, challenging this bid is the best move.
