Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 1, two 2s, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, and one 9 in my hand. Since this is the opening bid and I have two 2s, it's reasonable to start with a conservative bid of '3 2s', expecting there to be at least one more 2 in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 63959680, I have no 2s at all. The current bid is 3 2s, which means my opponent is asserting there are at least three 2s in total across both hands. Since I have zero 2s, that would require my opponent to hold all three or more 2s alone, which is quite unlikely. The probability of one player holding three or more of a specific digit out of eight is low. Therefore, challenging this bid is a strategically sound move.
