Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without worrying about being too high. I have two 6s and two 8s. Starting with a low quantity and a moderate digit seems reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I hold two 9s in my hand, which gives me confidence in bidding on 9s. The current bid is 2 6s, so moving to 2 9s uses the same quantity while increasing the digit value. Since I have direct evidence for two 9s, this bid is both valid and strategically strong, making it a safer play than challenging the moderately plausible 2 6s.

Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 6s, and I can see that bidding a higher quantity or digit is possible. Since the bid is 2 9s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it's higher than 2 and I have the digits to support a higher quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I hold only one 6 in my hand, so for the current bid of 3 6s to be valid my opponent would need to have at least two 6s in his 8 unknown digitsâ€”a probability of roughly 18.7%. Given this low likelihood and the fact that bidding on another digit (like 9s, even though I have two 9s) would require my opponent to supply at least one more 9 (a roughly 57% chance), challenging the current bid is the safest and most strategically sound move.
