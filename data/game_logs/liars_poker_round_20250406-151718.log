--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 4s, two 8s, and one 0. Starting with a modest and statistically reasonable opening bid, I'll choose 3 2s, as I already hold two 2s myself, making it likely there are at least three in total between both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have one 1, one 3, one 6, one 0, one 8, one 0, and one 7 in my hand. I see two 0s and no 2s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about the exact count of 2s, I'll increase the digit. Bidding 3 3s is a valid move as it increases the digit. However, I should also consider increasing the quantity if I think it's likely that there are more of a higher digit. I have one 6 and one 8, so there are potentially more 6s or 8s. However, the safest initial move is to match the quantity and increase the digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 3s, making it less likely that there are three or more 3s across both hands. The bid of 3 3s seems risky from my perspective since I hold zero, so unless the opponent has all three or more 3s, the bid is unlikely to be valid. Therefore, it is a good opportunity to challenge.
