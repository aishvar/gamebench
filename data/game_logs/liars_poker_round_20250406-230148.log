Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that there are no previous bids and I have a hand with repeated digits, I should start with a bid that reflects the information I have. I notice I have two 1s and a 7, but since I don't know what the other player has, I'll start with a conservative bid based on my most frequent digit, which is the '1'. Bidding on a digit I have the most of gives me a higher chance of being correct, considering the total possible count across both hands could be up to 16 for any digit. Thus, bidding 2 1s seems like a safe and reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid is 2 1s. Bidding 2 3s is a safe move because it maintains the quantity but increases the digit. Since I already have two 3s, the total count across both hands must be at least 2, making this bid automatically valid and impossible to challenge successfully.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 2 3s. Given that I only have one 3 and the bid is for two 3s, it's possible but not guaranteed that the total count of 3s across both hands is at least 2. Since I don't have enough information to confidently make a higher bid and considering the current bid is relatively low, challenging seems like a reasonable option to verify the existence of at least two 3s.
