Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have three 4s. I will bid 3 4s.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 4s

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I need to make a higher bid. Since my hand is 95831629, I have a total of 3 fours, which is not enough to confidently challenge, but I do have other digits I can use to make a higher bid. I see I have one 5 and other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. A reasonable next bid could be 4 5s, as it increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. I could bid 4 6s, but I have two 4s in my hand, and the previous bid was 3 4s. I'll bid 5 4s, increasing the quantity and basing the bid on my hand.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I need to make a higher bid. Since my hand contains a 6, 5, 9, 3, 1, and 2, I can see if I can make a reasonable bid based on my digits. I have one 5 and one 6. If I bid 6 5s, it seems too high without knowing the exact distribution of Player 0's digits. However, bidding 6 6s seems unreasonable given that I only have one 6. A safer bet would be to increase the quantity or digit slightly. I have one 5 in my hand, so I can try to bid higher with a digit I have. The bid 6 5s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and I have a 5 in my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. The maximum number of 5s possible is 16. 6 5s is not an unreasonable bid given the total number of digits in play. I can bid 7 0s, increasing the quantity and changing the digit to one I have two of. This is a safer bid than challenging.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 7 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that this bid is valid. My hand contains the digits 9, 5, 8, 3, 1, 6, 2, and 9. I have a total of 8 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit across both players' hands is 16. The current bid of 7 0s seems high but I need to assess the likelihood of there being 7 or more 0s in total. Given that I do not have any 0s in my hand, if I bid, I should consider a digit that I have. Since I have two 9s and the current bid is 7 0s, I could consider bidding on a digit I have. However, I must ensure my bid is higher than the current one. I will bid on a digit I have, increasing the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 9s. There are only 16 digits total in play. It is unlikely that there are eight 9s. I will challenge.
