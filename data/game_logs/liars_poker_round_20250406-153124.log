Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 3s, two 5s, and two 7s. A typical safe opening bid is 2 of a digit I hold multiple of. I will start with '2 5s' as I have two 5s, making this bid very plausible and putting some pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have one 5 in my hand (since my hand is 26872599). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 3 5s seems reasonable because I know there's at least one 5 in my hand and one in the opponent's hand. Alternatively, bidding 2 6s is also a valid higher bid. Given that I have two 6s and two 5s in my hand, bidding 3 6s seems like a more informed choice as it increases both the digit and quantity, making it a stronger bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 7,5,5,3,0,3,0,2. I have zero 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, meaning at least three 6s across both hands. Since I have none, all three would have to be in Player 1's hand, which is unlikely given only eight digits. The probability of someone holding three or more of the same digit is low without any in my hand. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
