Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, making it unlikely that there are many zeros overall. The current bid is minimal (1 0s), which is quite plausible since the opponent might have one zero. Challenging now would be risky because at least one zero between both hands is quite likely. A safe and strategic move is to increase the bid to a digit I have multiple copies of. I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding 2 8s is a reasonable and safe next bid.
