Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my first turn. I should start with a conservative bid to test the waters. Analyzing my hand (20433791), I have 3 '2's, 1 '0', 1 '3', 1 '7', 1 '9', and 1 '4'. The digit '2' appears most frequently. Since there's no previous bid to compare with, I can start with a low but reasonable bid. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and I have 3 '2's, bidding 2 '2's seems like a good starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Analyzing the current bid of '2 3s' made by Player 1, I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that Player 1 has overbid. Given my hand is '20433791', I count a total of 3 threes. The maximum possible quantity for any digit across both players' hands is 16. Since Player 1 bid '2 3s', they are claiming there are at least 2 threes in total. With 3 threes in my hand, if Player 1 has no threes, the total would be 3, which already exceeds their bid. However, I don't know Player 1's hand. A safe move would be to bid higher than '2 3s' if I can. I can bid '3 3s' as it's possible there are indeed 3 threes in total (all in my hand). This bid exceeds the current bid by quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (20433791), I see I have two 3s. The current bid is '2 3s'. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have more than 2 threes, I will increase the digit. I notice I have three 7s and two 3s, and other digits appear once or not at all. Bidding '3 7s' seems like a strong move because it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid.
