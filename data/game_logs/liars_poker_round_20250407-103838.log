Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. I could bid higher, but I don't have a strong read on the number of 1s. A naive player bid 2 1s. I will bid slightly higher, increasing the quantity to 3, but bidding it on a digit I have, 8. I have two 8s, making 3 8s a reasonable bid.
