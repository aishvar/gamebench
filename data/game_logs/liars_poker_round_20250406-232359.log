--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding with a reasonable initial bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 5s, and one each of 1, 6, 7, and 8. A common conservative opening bid is 2 of a common digit in my hand. Given that I have two 0s and two 5s, I can start with '2 5s' as my opening bid, which is safe and based on my hand.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s. Bidding 2 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit). Since I hold two 9s, the total count of 9s across all hands must be at least two (my two plus any in Player 0's hand), making this a safe bid that forces the opponent to either bid higher quantities or challenge a likely true claim.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s, which makes the current bid of 2 9s somewhat risky for my opponent. Since the total number of digits is 16 and I hold none of the 9s, all 2 (or more) 9s would have to be in Player 1's hand. The probability that Player 1 has 2 or more 9s is relatively low, making the current bid suspicious. Therefore, challenging now is a strategically sound choice.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 1's (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bid of 2 9s.
