Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 84367403. I count two 6s and one 3, 4, 7, and 8. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and consider the total count across both players. Since there are 8 digits in my hand and likely a similar distribution in the opponent's hand, I can make an educated guess. Bidding on a digit I have more than one of seems sensible. I have two 6s, so bidding on 6s with a quantity that reflects a potential total count across both hands is reasonable. Starting with 4 6s seems like a conservative yet reasonable bid, assuming my opponent might have at least one or two 6s as well.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand is 84367403, which contains two 7s. I previously bid 4 6s. To make a higher bid than 4 7s, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I have two 7s, it's plausible that the total count of 7s is at least 4. However, increasing the quantity seems more reasonable given the context. I will bid 5 7s, as it is a higher quantity and I have some basis to believe the total count could support this bid given my own hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (84367403), so the total count of 8s must be at least 1 (mine) plus some from the opponent's hand. The probability of having at least 5 8s seems low but not impossible. However, I can bid higher. Noting that my hand has a total of 2 digits that are 9 or higher is not possible since my highest digit is 8, but I can still make a higher bid by increasing the digit. Bidding 5 9s is a valid move as it increases the digit. Since I don't have any 9s, and it's unlikely the opponent has many, this bid is somewhat aggressive but plausible as a strategic move to put pressure on the opponent.
