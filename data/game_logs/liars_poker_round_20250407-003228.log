Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have two 7s in my hand. A safe starting bid would be 1 7s. This is a low quantity but establishes a baseline and utilizes a digit I possess.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, which means there are at least three 7s in total (including the one in Player 0's hand). The current bid is 1 7s, which is very low. I can safely increase the bid to 3 7s, as it is both a higher quantity and based on the digits I have.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 4 7s is a logical next step, as it increases the quantity while staying with the same digit. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit, but given my hand, increasing the 7s seems safest. Bidding 3 8s is also a possibility, but 4 7s feels more conservative and likely to be accurate.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 7s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total, it's unlikely there are more than 4 7s in play. Since I can't make a higher bid with 7s (as I only have two), and increasing the quantity to 5 7s would be risky, I should challenge the current bid.
