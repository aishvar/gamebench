Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Starting with the highest digit (9) limits opponents to only increasing the quantity. Bidding 2 of 9 is plausible since I have 1, and there's a ~57% chance the opponent has at least 1, making the total valid. This forces them to either raise the quantity or challenge early.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 9s'. I have one 9 in my hand (18519041). For the bid to be true, the opponent needs at least one 9 in their 8-digit hand. This is statistically quite likely. Challenging seems risky. I have three 1s in my hand. Bidding '3 1s' is a valid higher bid (increasing the quantity from 2 to 3). Since I hold all three 1s required for this bid, it's a very safe bid for me and puts pressure on the opponent. It's much safer than challenging the plausible '2 9s' bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. Since my hand has no 1s, challenging could be risky if the opponent has 3. However, I have three 6s, allowing me to bid 3 6s. This bid is valid (as I have three 6s) and exceeds the current bid by digit (6 > 1) while maintaining the same quantity. This avoids a direct challenge and shifts the pressure.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 18519041. I have three 1s, one 8, one 5, one 9, one 0, one 4, and zero 6s. The current bid from Player 0 is '3 6s'. 

To evaluate challenging: I have zero 6s. For the bid '3 6s' to be true, Player 0 must have at least three 6s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, this is not guaranteed, and Player 0 might be bluffing, especially after I bid '3 1s'. However, challenging carries risk if Player 0 does have three or more 6s.

To evaluate bidding higher: The next possible bids are '4 6s' (very unlikely as I have zero 6s), '3 7s', '3 8s', '3 9s', '4 0s', '4 1s', etc. 
- Bidding on 7s, 8s, 9s, or 0s with quantity 3 requires the opponent to have a significant number of those digits.
- Bidding '4 1s' leverages my strong hand (three 1s). This bid requires a total of four 1s across both hands. Since I have three, it only requires Player 0 to have at least one 1 in their 8 digits. The probability of an opponent having at least one specific digit in an 8-card hand is reasonably high (1 - (0.9)^8 â‰ˆ 57%). 

Comparing options: Bidding '4 1s' is a strong, information-based bid that puts pressure on the opponent. It is statistically safer than challenging the '3 6s' bid or bidding on digits where I hold fewer cards.

Player 1 bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. My hand has 0 1s, so the total number of 1s is exactly the opponent's count. The probability of the opponent having 4 or more 1s in their 8 digits is extremely low (statistically ~0.45% for exactly 4). Challenging is the optimal move as the bid is highly unlikely to be valid.
