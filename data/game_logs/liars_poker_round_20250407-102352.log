Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. The current bid is 1 0s, which is quite conservative given that there are 16 digits total and I already have one 0 myself. It is likely there is at least one more 0 in Player 0's hand, so a higher bid is reasonable and safe. I will raise the bid to 2 0s to increase the pressure while remaining within a plausible count.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand '17108272', I have zero 1s. Since there are 16 digits total and I hold none of the claimed digit, the opponent's bid of 2 1s relies entirely on their own hand. It's unlikely they have two 1s themselves. Given the naive opponent and the unlikelihood of 2 or more 1s in total, challenging is the optimal move.
