--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. I could bid higher, but I don't have enough information to confidently increase the quantity. I'll bid 3 0s, increasing the quantity and changing the digit to 0 which I also have in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Considering the total number of 0s across both players, it's possible that the total is less than 3. Challenging this bid could be a strategic move to potentially win the round if the actual count is lower than the bid.
