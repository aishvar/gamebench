Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. As the first bidder, starting with a moderate bid based on my strongest digit (3) is strategic. Bidding three 3s accounts for the possibility that the opponent has at least one 3, making the total â‰¥3. This creates a plausible opening while leaving room for escalation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 3s. This means there need to be at least two more 3s in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. While this is possible, it is not guaranteed. To avoid challenging too early and to maintain a competitive position, I will increase the bid to 4 4s. I have two 4s in my hand, so this bid leverages my hand strength while increasing the quantity and changing the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. For the current bid of 4 4s to be valid, the opponent must have at least three 4s in their 8-digit hand. Statistically, the probability of them holding three or more 4s is low (~3.8% assuming uniform distribution), making a successful challenge highly likely. Challenging now has better expected value than making a risky bid with uncertain digits like 5s or 6s.
