Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player, I must make an opening bid. Looking at my hand 32786357, the digit counts are: 3 (2), 2 (1), 7 (2), 8 (1), 6 (1), 5 (1). The most frequent digits in my hand are 3 and 7, each appearing twice. Since there are 16 digits total in play and no prior bids, it is safe and strategic to open with a conservative bid on a digit I hold multiple times. Therefore, I will open with '2 3', indicating I believe there are at least two 3s in total, which I know is true from my own hand alone.

Naive chooses BID: 2 4s
Player 1 bids: 2 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. Looking at my hand (32786357), I have zero 4s. Since I hold half the digits and have none, the probability that there are at least 2 total 4s relies entirely on Player 1 holding both. While it's possible, it's unlikely Player 1 has exactly 2 or more 4s. Given this, challenging is strategically sound, as the bid probably overstates the actual count.
