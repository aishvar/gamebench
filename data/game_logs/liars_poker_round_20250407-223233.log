Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the first bid. Based on my hand, I have two 3s. Bidding 2 3s is a safe starting point, as it is the minimum possible bid and I know for certain that there are at least two 3s in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 2 4s is a safe move because it's higher than the current bid of 2 3s, and I can guarantee at least two 4s in total, making it a valid bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 4s. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 4, increasing the quantity to 3 4s is not possible without knowing the other player's hand. However, I can bid 2 5s, increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity. This seems reasonable based on my hand, as I have one 5.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 5s. Bidding 2 6s is a higher bid since 6 is greater than 5, and I have the necessary cards to support this bid. This move is strategic as it increases the digit value while maintaining the same quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s, which is plausible given my hand and the fact that there are 16 digits in total. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 6, increasing the quantity to 3 6s is risky without knowing the other player's hand. However, I can bid 3 of a different digit that I have more of, such as 3 3s, which is a safer and higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 3s in my hand, so the total number of 3s depends entirely on Player 0's hand. The current bid is 3 3s, and given the bid history, Player 0 might be attempting to bluff. Challenging is risky but necessary as I cannot make a higher bid without lying.
