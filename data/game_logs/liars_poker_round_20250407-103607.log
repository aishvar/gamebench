Player 0 (Naive) making initial bid: 1 0s

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, I know there are at least two 0s in total, making it safe to increase the bid. A straightforward higher bid is 2 0s, which is both valid and supported by my hand.

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 2 1s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I see two 0s and one 1. The current bid is 2 1s. Since I only have one 1, for the bid to be valid, Player 0 must have at least one or more 1s. This is plausible, but not guaranteed. However, since I have two 0s, increasing the bid on 0s to 3 0s is safer because I only need Player 0 to have at least one 0 for that bid to be valid, which is quite likely. Therefore, I will raise the bid to 3 0s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 1s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s and two 1s. The current bid is 3 1s. Since I hold two 1s myself, Player 0 would only need to have at least one 1 to make the bid valid, which is quite plausible. Therefore, challenging now is risky. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. I have two 2s, so bidding 3 2s would be a safe minimal raise, as it's plausible that there is at least one other 2 in Player 0's hand. This is a conservative but reasonable next bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 2S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 3s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 03012269, I have two 2s, two 0s, two 1s, one 3, and one 6. The current bid is 3 3s, but I only have one 3. For there to be at least three 3s total, Player 0 must have at least two 3s, which is somewhat unlikely. Since the previous bids escalated from 0s to 1s to 2s to 3s, and I know the counts in my hand for those digits are quite high (two 0s, two 1s, two 2s), it is safer to bid on a digit I have strong counts in. I can raise the bid by quantity or digit. Given my two 2s, it's reasonable to bid 4 2s, as it's plausible there are at least two 2s in Player 0's hand, making a total of four. This is a safer and stronger bid than challenging now.
