--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I must start the bidding. My hand contains two 8s (digits '8' in '81274580'). A safe and strong opening bid is to call '2 8s', reflecting my own hand's holdings, which is likely to be valid given the unknown opponent's hand. This avoids underbidding and sets a reasonable initial challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (50696235), I have 0 8s. The current bid is '2 8s', meaning Player 0 claims there are at least 2 8s total between our hands. Since I have 0 8s, this means Player 0 must have at least 2 8s in their hand for this bid to be valid. This is entirely possible since each player has 8 digits, and Player 0 could easily have 2 or more 8s. Rather than challenging, I should make a higher bid. I can either bid more 8s or switch to a higher digit (9). Looking at my hand, I have one 9, so bidding '2 9s' would be reasonable as it only requires Player 0 to have 1 more 9 to be valid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 81274580, which contains two 8s and zero 9s. The current bid is 2 9s, suggesting there are at least two 9s across both hands. Since I hold zero 9s, the entire count would have to come from Player 1's hand. For Player 1 to have two or more 9s is possible but somewhat unlikely, though not implausible. However, since Player 1 increased from 2 8s (where I know I have two 8s, so that bid was safe) to 2 9s, it may be a bluff to push me into a risky higher bid. Given the uncertainty and that I have no 9s, challenging here is strategically sound rather than making a risky higher bid.
