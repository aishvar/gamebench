Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning this is the first bid. I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 5, one 6, and one 8 in my hand. A safe starting bid would be to bid on a digit I have, increasing the quantity slightly. I'll bid 1 0s, as it's a low digit and I have one in my hand. This is a conservative start to gather information.

Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 1 0s, which is the minimum possible bid. I can safely increase the bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 0, bidding 2 0s is a reasonable move, increasing the quantity while keeping the same digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 3 0s is a safe and reasonable bid, as it's based on my hand and is higher than the current bid. Increasing the digit would be riskier without knowing the other player's hand.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s, which is already higher than the total 0s I know about. Since I only have one 0, it's unlikely there are three 0s in total. Challenging seems like the best move.
