Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 0s, two 3s, one 1, one 2, one 6, and one 9. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I will bid 2 7s, reflecting the two 7s I hold, which is a safe and standard opening.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 2, 1, 9, 7, 0, 6, 3, 7. I have zero 8s, which makes it unlikely that there are two or more 8s across both hands. Since the current bid is only 2 8s, this is a marginal but plausible claim, but given I have none, the chance that the opponent holds both 8s is low. Therefore, challenging here is a good strategic move.
