--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, two 5s, two 3s, and one 8. The most common digits are 6, 5, and 3, each appearing twice. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid, I will choose 3 6s, expecting that my opponent likely has at least one 6 as well.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have the digits 99071085, so I have one 6. The total count of 6s across both hands must be at least 3 (since Player 0 bid 3 6s). I can either challenge or make a higher bid. A higher bid could be 4 6s or 3 7s. Since I have no information about the other player's hand, I'll analyze the likelihood of the bid being true. Given that I have one 6, it's possible that the total count is 3 or more. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it slightly increases the quantity. I'll choose to bid 4 6s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 6s (digits: 6,5,8,6,5,1,3,3). The current bid is 4 6s, and since I hold three, it would require the opponent to have at least one 6 for the bid to be valid. This is quite plausible, so challenging now carries significant risk. To stay in the game strategically, I can raise the bid slightly without overcommitting, by increasing the digit while maintaining the same quantity. The next valid bid would be 4 7s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand is 99071085, which contains one 7. This means there are 7 other digits in my hand, none of which are 7. The total count of 7s across both hands must be at least 4 (the current bid) and at most 9 (if the other player had 5 or more 7s). I have one 7, so the other player must have at least 3. Bidding 5 7s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. However, I can also consider bidding on a higher digit. Since my hand doesn't have any digits higher than 7 besides 9 (and I have two of those), bidding 4 9s is a valid and potentially safer move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 65865133, I have zero 9s. Since the total number of digits is 16, for the bid of 4 9s to be valid, my opponent would need to have at least 4 or more 9s, which is quite unlikely. Given that I have none, and the bid has already increased from 4 6s to 4 7s and then 4 9s, it seems like a bluff or an overreach. The probability that there are 4 or more 9s total is low, so challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
