--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 01521744. I count 2 fours and 2 ones. A reasonable starting bid could be based on the count of a digit I have. Bidding on '1s' seems plausible since there are 2 ones in my hand, suggesting there could be more across all hands. I'll bid 5 1s, as it is a relatively conservative start.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. Given that I have no 1s in my hand (68853966), and considering the total number of digits in play is 32, I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 5 1s across all players' hands. Since I have no 1s, it's highly unlikely that there are 5 or more 1s. I should challenge this bid as it seems improbable.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
