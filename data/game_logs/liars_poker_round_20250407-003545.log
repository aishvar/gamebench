Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (47507950), I see that I have two 5s and two 0s. Bidding 2 5s seems reasonable as it's a safe starting point, and I can potentially increase the bid later if needed.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. I have one 6. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable increase in digit and a small increase in quantity, and it's a digit I possess. It's not a huge risk, and increases the pressure on the other player.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 6s. Since I only have two 6s, it's unlikely there are three 6s in total. However, I can increase the bid by raising the quantity to 4 but must choose a different digit. I have three 5s, so bidding 4 5s is a reasonable move, increasing the quantity and leveraging my hand's strength in 5s.

Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Player 0 previously bid 2 5s and Player 1 bid 3 6s, then Player 0 increased to 4 5s. This suggests Player 0 might have multiple 5s. However, bidding 5 5s seems too risky given I have no 5s. I can bid 4 6s, which is the same quantity as the previous bid but on a higher digit. Alternatively, I could challenge, but 4 5s doesn't seem outrageously high. I will bid 4 6s as I have one 6 in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 6s. Since there are only 16 digits in total, it's unlikely there are 4 or more 6s in play. I should challenge the bid.
