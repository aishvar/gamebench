Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 55926694, which has a total of 2 fives, 2 sixes, 1 nine, and 1 four. I can start by bidding on the most frequent digit in my hand. The digit '5' appears twice, so I'll bid on '5'. To avoid being too aggressive, I'll start with the quantity 4, which is a reasonable guess considering there are two players and 16 digits in total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have zero 4s in my hand. It's unlikely the opponent has enough 4s to make this bid true, given they only have 8 cards. Bidding higher would be risky as I have no 4s and would be relying on the opponent having a large number of 4s. Therefore, challenging is the best course of action.
