Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s is a plausible bluff, as the opponent might have at least one 7. Choosing a higher digit (7) allows future bids to either increase the quantity or choose a higher digit with the same or lower quantity. This balances between being aggressive and manageable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 sevens. Looking at my hand (56025971), I have one 7. For the total to be at least 3, the opponent would need to have at least two 7s. Since each player has 8 digits, the total maximum sevens is 16, but statistically, having 3 or more is plausible. It's risky to challenge this early on a 3-count bid. A safer strategy is to increase the bid slightly to maintain pressure. I can raise the quantity to 4 for a lower digit that I have multiple of, but I only have one 5, one 6, two 0s, two 5s, one 9, one 2, one 7, and one 1. I have two 5s, so bidding 4 5s is reasonable, assuming the opponent has at least two 5s. Alternatively, I can bid 4 7s, but since I only have one 7, that's riskier. Therefore, I'll increase the bid to 4 5s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. Your hand has no 5s, so the total count of 5s depends solely on Player 1's hand. Since each player has 8 digits, the maximum possible 5s is 8 (if Player 1 has all 5s). However, the bid of 4 is slightly above the average expected count (3.2 total for a digit). Given you have no 5s, there's a risk Player 1 is bluffing. Challenging is favorable because if Player 1 has â‰¤3 5s, you win. Bidding higher (e.g., 4 6s) is possible but riskier since your hand only has 2 6s, requiring Player 1 to have at least 2, which is uncertain. Challenging balances risk and logic.
