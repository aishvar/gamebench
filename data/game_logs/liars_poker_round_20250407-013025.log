Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 96811637, I have two 1s, two 6s, and one each of 9, 8, 3, and 7. Statistically, starting with a conservative bid is reasonable. I will start with '2 6s' because I hold two 6s, making this bid safe and forcing the opponent to either raise or challenge.
