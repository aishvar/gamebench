Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, two 8s, one 1, one 5, one 9, and one 7. Starting with a conservative yet reasonable opening bid, I will choose '3 6s' because I hold two 6s myself, making it likely that there is at least one more 6 in the opponent's hand.
