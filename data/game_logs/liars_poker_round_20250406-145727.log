--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand '71097851', I have two 1s, two 7s, two 8s, one 0, one 5, and one 9. The most frequent digits in my hand are 1, 7, and 8, each appearing twice. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I choose '3 7s' as there are likely at least one more 7 among the other two players' 16 digits combined.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are three 7s in total across all hands. I should challenge this bid.
