Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 4s, and one each of 0, 3, 9, and 7. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, reflecting my own hand, as the total count across both hands is likely higher or at least equal, making this bid conservative yet competitive.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Bidding higher than 2 5s is possible. I have two 1s, two 2s, one 0 and one 8. Bidding 3 0s is a reasonable option, as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 3 1s. Since 0 is a less common digit, 3 0s is a slightly more conservative bid and might be less likely to be challenged immediately. However, 3 1s is also plausible given my hand. I'll go with 3 1s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 5s and no 1s. The current bid is 3 1s, which requires at least three 1s across both hands. Since I have zero 1s, all three would need to be in Player 1's hand, which is somewhat unlikely but possible. Instead of challenging now, I can safely increase the bid based on my strong count of 5s. I will raise to 3 5s, matching the quantity but increasing the digit, which is a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Given the bid history, Player 0 seems confident in 5s. However, it's unlikely there are 3 5s total. I will challenge the bid.
