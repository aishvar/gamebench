Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the opening bid, so I want to start conservatively but establish some information. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 9, one 4, one 6, one 0, one 5, one 8, and one 2â€”so one of each digit. A typical opening is a bid of 2 of a common digit. Digits like 0 or 1 tend to occur frequently, so starting with 2 1s is a safe and reasonable opening bid.
