Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a good mix of digits in my hand. To make a strong initial bid, I should aim for a digit that is not too common, but not too rare either. I notice I have two 8s, so I should bid on that digit, but I need to make it a bit more challenging than just 2 8s. Considering my hand, I can reasonably expect to have at least 3 8s in total, so I'll bid 3 8s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 97331245, I have zero 8s. Since there are only 16 digits total and I hold none, the entire bid of 3 8s depends solely on Player 0 having at least 3. That is somewhat unlikely, as 3 of 8 digits being 8s is a high concentration. Therefore, I believe it's a bluff or overestimate, and the best move is to challenge.
