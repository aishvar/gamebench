Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 1, 4, 1, 7, 3, 0, 7, 7. I have one 0 myself. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, and I know I have one, it's very likely there is at least one 0 in total, so challenging now would almost certainly lose. To make a minimal higher bid, I can either bid 1 1s (same quantity, higher digit) or increase the quantity to 2 0s. I see I have two 1s, so bidding 2 1s is a safe and slightly stronger bid based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (14173077), I have no 2s, so the current bid of 2 2s relies entirely on Player 0 having at least 2 of them, or a very lucky distribution. Since I have zero 2s, the chance that there are at least 2 total is moderate but plausible, so challenging now may be risky. Instead, I can safely increase the bid by quantity or digit. I notice I have three 7s, so bidding 3 7s leverages my strong holding and is a natural, safe next move.
