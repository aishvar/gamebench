Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid. I have one 8 in my hand, which is a relatively high digit. Bidding 3 8s seems like a reasonable starting point, as it's unlikely that my opponent has more than two 8s, making it difficult for them to challenge successfully.
