--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there has been no bid yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 0s, and one each of 1, 2, 5, 6. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my two 8s makes sense, as there are likely at least one 8 in the opponent's hand, making a total of at least three plausible. Therefore, I will open with '3 8s'.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (40908241), so the total count of 8s is at least 1 (mine) plus the count in Player 0's hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't know Player 0's hand, I'll consider the information I have. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit, making it harder for Player 0 to challenge without having a strong hand in 9s. However, I should also consider the likelihood of having more 8s or other digits. Given the current bid and my hand, bidding 4 8s seems too aggressive without more information about 8s. Thus, bidding 3 9s is a safer and reasonable strategy.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 68580172, I have zero 9s, so the current bid of 3 9s relies entirely on the opponent holding at least 3 9s, which is quite unlikely given only 8 digits. Also, since I have no 9s, raising on 9s is risky. However, I have two 8s, and the prior bid was 3 8s. It is safer to increase the quantity with a digit I hold multiples of. Therefore, I will raise to 4 8s, which is a valid higher bid and plausible based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (from 40908241), so the total count of 8s is at least 1. The bid of 4 8s is plausible but I need to think about the probability. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. I have two options to make a higher bid: increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since my hand doesn't have many high digits, I'll consider increasing the digit. Bidding 4 9s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 68580172, I have zero 9s. Since there are 16 digits total and I hold none, the opponent would need to have all 4 or more 9s alone to meet their bid. That is highly improbable, as 4 out of 8 digits being 9s is unlikely. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
