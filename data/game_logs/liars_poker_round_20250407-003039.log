--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 4s, two 1s, one 9, and one 0. A safe and reasonable opening bid is '2 4s' based on my two 4s, as it's unlikely to be immediately challenged and is a modest start.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid is 2 4s. I can increase the bid by either raising the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 4s, I'll bid 3 3s, which is a higher quantity and a digit I have in my hand.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 8, 4, 9, 8, 0, 1, 4, 1. I have no 3s, so the current bid of 3 3s relies entirely on the opponent having at least 3 of them, which is somewhat unlikely with only 8 digits. Since I have zero 3s, the chance that there are 3 or more 3s total is low, making it a good opportunity to challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 1's (cohere/command-a:floor) bid of 3 3s.
