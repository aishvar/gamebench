Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, I have a total of 3 occurrences of the digit '7'. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and I have 8 digits, it's possible that the other player also has some '7's. However, bidding on a high quantity of '7's might be too risky. A safer approach would be to bid on a moderate quantity of a digit that appears frequently in my hand. The digit '7' appears three times, but I'll start with a lower quantity to minimize risk.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 sevens. Looking at my hand (52698162), I have zero 7s. Since I hold half of all digits and have none, for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need to have all 3 or more 7s in their hand, which is unlikely. Given the low probability the opponent holds 3 or more sevens alone, the best move is to challenge the bid.
