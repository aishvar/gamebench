--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s and two 6s, which are the most frequent digits. Bidding 2 5s or 2 6s seems reasonable as a starting point, but to be more aggressive, I'll bid 3 5s, assuming there might be at least one more 5 in the other player's hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. Bidding 4 9s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 9s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total, it's unlikely there are 4 or more 9s. I should challenge this bid.
