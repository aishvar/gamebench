Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I see two 0s, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 8, and one 9. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will choose '2 0s' because I have two 0s myself, making it likely there are at least two in total.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I don't have any 0s in my hand. However, I don't have enough information to confidently challenge. I can make a slightly higher bid. I will bid 3 1s, as this is a small increase and 1 is a relatively common digit.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s and only one 1. The current bid is 3 1s, which means there must be at least three 1s in total. Since I only have one 1, Player 1 would need to have at least two 1s for the bid to be valid. This is plausible, so challenging now is risky. To raise, I can either bid 3 2s (same quantity, higher digit) or increase the quantity. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, so bidding 3 2s is safer than 4 1s. I will bid 3 2s to increase the digit while maintaining the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity to 4 and keeping the digit as 2, or by increasing the digit. I will bid 4 2s, which is a safe increase.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 2S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 34896001, I have zero 2s. Since the current bid is 4 2s, all four would have to be in my opponent's hand, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. The probability of them having 4 or more 2s is low. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
