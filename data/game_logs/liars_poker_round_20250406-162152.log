Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two 8s in my hand, I can start with a conservative bid that reflects my hand. Bidding 2 8s is a safe starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 27331535, I have zero 8s. Since the current bid is only 2 8s, it's quite plausible that the opponent has two or more 8s. Challenging now is risky. The safest move is to increase the bid slightly. I notice I have three 3s, so bidding 3 3s is a natural and safe increment, raising the quantity while switching to a digit I hold strongly.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, but the current bid is 3 3s. Since 3s are not in my hand, it's unlikely that there are three 3s across both hands. Challenging seems like the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
