Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which is the highest quantity of any digit I hold. Since there's no current bid, I can start by bidding 2 6s, which is a safe and reasonable opening move based on my hand.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (from the digit '6' in 38217140). The current bid is 2 6s. Since I only have one, it's possible the opponent has at least one more 6 to make the bid valid. However, the bid is still low, so I can safely increase the bid to 3 6s, which is a higher quantity but still plausible given the total number of digits in play.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s. Considering the possibility that the other player might have at least one 6, the total could be three or more. Bidding 4 6s is a strategic move to potentially win if the total is four or higher.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s, which means the opponent must have at least 4 6s in their hand. Given that the total number of digits is 16 (8 per player), it's possible but unlikely that the opponent has 4 or more 6s. Since I have none, the probability of the bid being valid is low. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
