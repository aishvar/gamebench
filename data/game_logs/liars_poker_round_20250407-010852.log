Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make the first bid. I have two 9s in my hand, which gives me a strong position to start. I will bid 2 9s, which is a reasonable initial bid based on my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand (07653870). For the bid to be true, the opponent must hold at least two 9s. While the probability of a random 8-digit hand having two or more 9s is relatively low (around 19%), challenging the very first bid is risky as I have no information about the opponent's strategy or hand. Instead, I can make a higher bid based on my own hand. I have two 0s and two 7s. The lowest possible valid bid is '3 0s'. This bid requires the opponent to have at least one 0, which is statistically more likely (~57% chance for a random hand) than them having two 9s. Bidding '3 0s' is a conservative move, leverages my hand's strength (two 0s), and puts the decision back onto the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have two 9s and one of each of the digits 2, 3, 8, and 1, but no 0s. Since the current bid is 3 0s, I can't make a valid higher bid with 0s, and I need to increase the quantity or the digit. I can bid 4 2s, which is a valid higher bid because it increases both the quantity and the digit, and I have at least one 2 in my hand.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 4 2s

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. My hand is 07653870, which contains zero 2s. For the bid of 4 2s to be accurate, the other player (Player 0) must have at least four 2s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, requiring half of their hand to be a specific digit seems statistically unlikely, especially since they didn't bid on 2s previously. Given I have no 2s to contribute, the burden of proof is entirely on Player 0. Challenging seems like a higher probability play than making a higher bid based on my hand (e.g., 4 7s requiring two 7s from opponent, or 5 0s requiring three 0s from opponent). The jump from 3 0s to 4 2s also feels potentially aggressive or like a bluff.
