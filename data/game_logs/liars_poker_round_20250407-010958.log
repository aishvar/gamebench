Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and need to make the first bid. My hand is 73369506. I have two 3s and two 6s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. The expected number of any digit across the 16 total digits is 1.6. Having two 6s suggests that a bid of three 6s is plausible, assuming the opponent has at least one 6 (which is statistically likely). Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable opening bid based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, making the total number of 6s at least one. The current bid is 3 6s, which would require Player 0 to have at least two 6s. Considering the relatively high digit and the uncertainty of Player 0's hand, challenging the bid is a reasonable move as it's unlikely there are three or more 6s in total.
