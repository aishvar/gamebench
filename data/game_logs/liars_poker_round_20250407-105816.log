--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. My hand contains one 7, two 3s, and one 9, along with other digits. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 3s, as I already have two 3s myself, making this bid very safe.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 2 3s. By bidding 2 9s, I maintain the quantity but increase the digit, which is a valid higher bid. Since I already hold two 9s, the total count of 9s cannot be less than 2, making this a safe bid regardless of the opponent's hand.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 2 9s, which requires there to be at least one more 9 in Player 1's hand. This is plausible, so challenging now is risky. To outbid, I can raise the quantity or increase the digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, the only option is to increase the quantity to 3 9s. Given that I have one 9, assuming Player 1 has at least two 9s is less likely, making a bid of 3 9s risky. Alternatively, I can bid 3 of a lower digit where I have more confidence. I have two 7s, so bidding 3 7s is safer, as it only requires Player 1 to have at least one 7, which is reasonable. Therefore, I will bid 3 7s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, requiring at least two more from the opponent. Given the opponent initially bid on 3s and switched to 7s, they might be bluffing. The probability of them holding exactly two 7s is uncertain, but challenging now provides a reasonable chance to catch an overbid.
