Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can start with any valid bid. I have two 0s and one 3 in my hand. Bidding 3 3s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 3.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. My hand contains one 3 and two 6s. Bidding 3 6s increases the digit (6 > 3) while maintaining the same quantity, which is valid. This leverages my two 6s and assumes the opponent has at least one 6. Challenging risks losing if they have two 3s. Bidding 3 6s is safer and strategically higher.

Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, which makes a bid of 4 6s reasonable. This bid increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the previous bid, making it a valid and strategic move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have two 6s, raising the quantity to 5 is risky. Instead, bidding 4 7s (same quantity but a higher digit) is valid. I have one 7, and challenging risks losing if the opponent has two 6s (total of 4).
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have no 7s in my hand, making it risky to bid higher on 7s. However, I have two 8s, which suggests that there might be fewer than 4 7s in total. Challenging the bid seems like a good strategy, as it's unlikely that the opposing player has enough 7s to cover the bid.
