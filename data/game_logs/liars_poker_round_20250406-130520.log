Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 2 7s is a safe starting point to begin the game.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I can see that my hand contains one 7. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 9 in my hand, bidding 2 9s is a valid move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Requesting action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding higher than 2 9s is necessary. I have two 3s, one 4, one 5, one 6, and one 7. I can bid 3 3s, which is a higher quantity than 2 9s. Alternatively, I can bid 2 of a higher digit, but the next digits are 4, 5, 6, and 7. Bidding 2 4s, 2 5s, 2 6s, or 2 7s wouldn't be as strong as bidding 3 3s since I have more 3s. Therefore, I will bid 3 3s.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, which supports the previous bid of 2 7s. The current bid is 3 3s, which is higher in quantity but lower in digit. Since I don't have any 3s in my hand, it's risky to challenge. A safer move would be to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, based on the 7s I have.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I need to make a higher bid. I can see that I have one 7 in my hand (46700983). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have two 9s, bidding 3 9s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Requesting action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding higher in quantity with 9s is risky. I can bid 4 3s, as I have three 3s in my hand. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have two 4s, one 5, and one 7. Bidding 4 4s is plausible, but 4 5s or 4 7s is less likely to be beaten. Given the previous bids and the fact that 3 9s is already on the table, I will bid 4 3s as it's a reasonable increase based on my hand and the digit has already been bid on, indicating some presence in the game.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 4 3s, which means there would need to be at least three more 3s among the other two players' hands (since I only have one). Given that the bid history shows a steady increase in bids, but not an excessive amount, it's plausible that the other players might have a few 3s. However, with only one 3 in my hand, I'm not confident enough to challenge. I'll make a conservative bid of 4 7s, increasing the digit from 3 to 7 while keeping the quantity the same, based on the two 7s in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand contains two 7s (46700983), so I know there are at least 2 7s. The total count of 7s across all players must be at least 2 (mine) plus some from the other two players. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since my hand has a 9, and the previous bid was 3 9s by me, it's likely there's at least one more 9. Bidding 4 9s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and digit from the previous relevant bid (3 9s).

--- Turn: Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Given the bid history, Player 1 seems confident in 9s. However, the previous bids show a pattern of increasing the digit or quantity. Since I have no 9s, bidding 5 9s would be a blatant lie, and 4 9s already feels high. I have two 3s, two 4s, and one 7. Bidding 5 3s is possible but doesn't significantly increase the bid. Bidding 5 4s is also possible. However, given the previous bids and the fact that the current bid is 4 9s, it's likely that there are not 4 9s in total. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
