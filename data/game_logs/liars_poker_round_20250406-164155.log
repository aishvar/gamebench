Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 26531442, I have two 4s, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 6, and no 0s, 1s, 7s, 8s, or 9s. Since this is the opening bid and I have two 4s in my hand, starting with a bid of '3 4s' is reasonable - it only requires one more 4 in the opponent's hand, which is fairly likely given they have 8 digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 4s in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s, which seems high given that I have none. However, the other player might have up to 3 4s, making the bid possible. Since I don't have strong evidence to challenge, I'll make a conservative higher bid with a digit I have in my hand.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand, and the opponent raised to 3 7s. I can see that I have no 7s in my hand, which means the opponent would need to have all 3 claimed 7s in their hand for their bid to be true. While possible, this seems unlikely. Additionally, since they raised my '3 4s' bid (which I knew was safe due to my two 4s), they may be bluffing. The probability of them having exactly 3 7s when I have none is relatively low.
