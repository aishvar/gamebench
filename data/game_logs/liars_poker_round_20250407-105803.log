Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 1s, two 3s, one 6, one 7, one 8, and one 9. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on the most frequent digits in my hand is strategic. I will start with '2 0s' since I hold two zeros myself, making it very likely to be true and putting mild pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one '1'. Since the current bid is 2 1s, that would require at least one more '1' in Player 1's hand, which is plausible. Rather than challenging this low bid, it's better to incrementally increase the bid. I also have two '0's in my hand, so bidding 3 0s is reasonable as it only requires one '0' in Player 1's hand, which is quite likely.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (08396170), I have two 0s and zero 1s. The current bid is 3 1s. Since I have no 1s, the opponent would need at least all 3 1s in their hand to make the bid valid. Given that 3 out of 8 digits being 1s is already somewhat unlikely, and combined with my zero 1s, the total count being 3 or more is doubtful. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 1's (Naive 50/50) bid of 3 1s.
