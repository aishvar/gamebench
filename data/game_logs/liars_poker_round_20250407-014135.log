Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game, and I need to make a strategic opening. Looking at my hand (31594076), I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 9. Since I don't have any digit that appears multiple times, I should bid conservatively based on what I know exists. I'll bid '2 7s' - I know I have one 7, and there's a reasonable chance the opponent has at least one 7 as well. This is a moderate opening bid that doesn't reveal too much about my hand while still being potentially valid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand (72183138). The opponent bid '2 7s', which means they're claiming there are at least 2 sevens total between both hands. Since I can see one 7 in my hand, their bid of '2 7s' is quite reasonable and likely true. I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. Looking at my hand, I have three 3s, which gives me confidence to bid '3 3s'. While this is a lower digit than 7, the higher quantity makes it a valid higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (31594076), I have zero 3s. The current bid is '3 3s', which means my opponent is claiming there are at least 3 threes in total between our hands. Since I have none, all 3 would need to be in my opponent's hand. This is possible but not guaranteed. My opponent could be bluffing or telling the truth. I could challenge, but it's still early in the game, and 3 is a modest quantity. Instead, I'll make a higher bid based on what I know for certain. I have one 5 in my hand, so I'll bid '3 5s', increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity. This is a reasonable bid that forces my opponent to either increase the quantity or digit further, or challenge me.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 72183138, I have two 3s but no 5s. The opponent bid '3 5s', claiming there are at least 3 fives total. Since I have zero 5s in my hand, the opponent would need to have all 3 fives in their hand for their bid to be true. While possible, I can make a safer bid of '3 7s' since I already see one 7 in my hand and it's a higher digit than 5, keeping the same quantity.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (31594076), I have one 7. The current bid is 3 7s, meaning Player 1 is claiming there are at least 3 sevens total between our hands. Since I have 1 seven, that would mean Player 1 needs to have at least 2 sevens in their hand for this bid to be valid. This is certainly possible but not guaranteed. Given that I've already shown willingness to bid on 5s (I have one 5 in my hand), I could raise to 3 9s (I have one 9). However, I could also bid 4 0s (I have one 0) or 4 1s (I have one 1) to increase the quantity. Since we're early in the game and the quantities are still low, I'll bid 4 0s to increase the quantity while using a digit I have in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 72183138, I have zero 0s. The opponent bid '4 0s', claiming there are at least 4 zeros total. Since I have none, this means they would need to have at least 4 zeros in their hand of 8 digits, which is possible but seems unlikely given the bidding history. They started with 2 7s (I have one 7), then went to 3 5s (I have none), and now 4 0s. The sudden jump to 4 0s when I have none makes this bid suspicious.
