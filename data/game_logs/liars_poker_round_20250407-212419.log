Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. The digit '5' appears twice in my hand. Assuming the other player also has a similar distribution, a bid of '5 Q' (5 fives) is a reasonable starting point. This bid is likely to be true, and it sets a baseline for future bidding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. The digit '5' appears twice in my hand. Assuming my opponent has a similar distribution, a bid of 'Q D' (which means 4) is a reasonable starting point. This bid is low enough to be safe but high enough to start the game.

Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable bid. I have two 3s in my hand. Assuming the opponent has a similar distribution, a bid of 3 Queens (Q) seems safe. This bid is low enough to be likely true but high enough to start the game.
