Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand (65988481), I have two 8's, which is a good starting point. Since there are 16 total digits in the game (8 from each player), I can expect that the other player might have some 8's as well. However, I don't want to bid too high initially. A conservative first bid would be to claim there are three 8's in total, which means I'm suggesting my opponent has at least one 8 in their hand. This is a reasonable assumption and gives me room to maneuver in future rounds.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. My hand contains no 8s, so the total number of 8s is exactly the opponent's count. The probability of the opponent having 3 or more 8s in their 8-digit hand is ~3.7%, calculated using binomial distribution (C(8,k)*(0.1)^k*(0.9)^(8-k)). Challenging has a ~96% chance of success, making it the optimal play.
