Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 25540634. I have two 5s and two 4s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. The expected number of any digit across all 16 cards is 1.6. Having two 5s means a bid of '2 5s' is guaranteed safe. A bid of '3 5s' requires the opponent to have at least one 5, which is statistically likely (roughly a 57% chance they have at least one). Starting with '3 5s' is a reasonably strong opening based on my hand, putting some pressure on the opponent without being overly risky.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I only hold one 5 in my hand and the current bid is 3 5s. This means that for the bid to be true, the opponent's hand of 8 digits would need to contain at least 2 additional 5s. Given that each digit has roughly a 10% chance of being a 5, the probability of the opponent having two or more 5s is quite low. Therefore, it's statistically favorable to challenge the bid.
