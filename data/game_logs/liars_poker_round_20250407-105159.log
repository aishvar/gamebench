Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, two 2s, one 4, one 6, one 8, and one 8. The digit 8 appears twice, making it a strong candidate. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid of 2 8s reflects my hand strength and puts early pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8 and zero 9s. The current bid is 2 9s, which would require there to be two or more 9s across both hands. Since I have no 9s, Player 1 would need to have both 9s, which is unlikely. Therefore, I believe challenging is the best move.
