Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative opening bid. I have two 1s in my hand, so I'll bid a small number of 1s. Bidding 2 1s seems like a safe starting point.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. The total count of 1s across both hands must be at least 2, so the bid is possible but not confirmed. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Since the quantity is low and there's a chance the other player has more 1s or other digits, I'll increase the bid by changing the digit to a higher one. I will bid 2 2s, maintaining the same quantity but increasing the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. It's possible there are at least two 2s in total. However, I can safely bid higher by increasing the quantity to 3 and choosing a digit that is not in my hand, like 7. This minimizes the risk of being challenged successfully.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I need to make a bid that is higher. My hand is 48332668, which contains no 7s. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have any 7s, I should bid on a higher digit or a higher quantity if I have a reasonable expectation. I have two 6s and two 8s. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. It's possible there are at least three 8s in total. I will increase the bid to 4 8s to play it safe.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have my hand: 48332668, which contains two 8s. To determine the likelihood of the bid being true, I need to consider the total count of 8s. I have 2 eights, so 2 are already accounted for. The bid claims there are at least 4 eights in total. This means there must be at least 2 eights in the other player's hand. Given that my hand has a decent distribution and I don't see any obvious pattern that would make the other player have exactly 2 or more 8s, it's a bit suspicious but not impossible. However, bidding higher seems reasonable. I can bid 4 9s, increasing the digit. Alternatively, I could challenge, but given the information I have, making a slightly higher bid is more strategic.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. The bid is relatively low, so it's possible there are at least four 9s in total. I could bid higher, but I'll play it safe and bid a slightly higher quantity with a lower digit that I have in my hand. I have two 1s, so I will bid 5 1s.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have one 1 (from 48332668) in my hand, so I know there are at least 6 digits in total between our hands. Bidding 6 1s is a safe and reasonable move as it directly increases the quantity while keeping the same digit. This is a conservative strategy, and I can always reassess the situation on my next turn.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. I could bid higher on 1s, or I could bid on a different number. Since the bid is already at 6, going significantly higher might be risky. I'll bid 7 1s, a small increase.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 7 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand is 48332668, which contains two 1s. The total count of 1s across both hands must be at least 7 for the current bid to be valid. I have two 1s, so the other player must have at least 5. It's possible but I should consider the likelihood. Bidding 7 2s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit. However, considering the history, Player 0 has been aggressive. I should be cautious. I will challenge if I think the bid is likely to be true or make a slightly higher bid. Since I have no 2s, bidding 8 1s is a safer option as it increases the quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 8 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. It's possible there are at least eight 1s in total, but it's also possible the other player is bluffing. I will raise the bid to 9 1s, which is a small increase and puts the pressure back on the other player.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 9 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 1s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and we have 16 digits in total, bidding 10 0s is a reasonable move as it increases the quantity. However, I should first analyze my hand to see if there's a more informed decision. My hand is 48332668, which contains no 1s and two 6s and two 8s. Given that the bidding has been aggressive on 1s, it's possible that Player 0 has a strong hand in 1s. I will increase the quantity and bid 10 1s, as it's still a relatively safe bet given the history.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 10 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. It's possible there are at least 10 ones in total, but it's also possible that the opponent is bluffing. Since there are only 16 total digits, bidding much higher on 1s becomes risky. I will bid a slightly higher quantity on a different digit to try and probe the opponent. I will bid 11 2s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 11 2S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 11 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 11 2s. I have one 2 in my hand (48332668), so the total count of 2s across both hands must be at least 1 (mine) and at most 9 (if the other player has all 8 remaining 2s). The bid of 11 2s is highly unlikely because it exceeds the maximum possible count of 2s, which is 8 (the other player's hand) + 1 (my 2) = 9. Given this, challenging the bid is the most reasonable action.
