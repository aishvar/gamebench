--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 3s, one 4, one 5, one 6, and one 9. The most frequent digits are 8 and 3, each appearing twice. A conservative and reasonable opening bid is 2 8s, reflecting my strong holding in 8s and leaving room to maneuver in future rounds.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 (from 46392046) in my hand, so it's plausible that there's at least one more 8 in the other player's hand, making the bid somewhat reasonable. However, I can bid higher. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 2 9s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit. Alternatively, bidding 3 8s also seems feasible as it increases the quantity. Given my hand, I see two even digits (4, 6, 2, 4, 6), which include multiple low digits and a couple of higher digits. I can try to bid on a digit I have more of or a higher digit. Since I have two 4s and two 6s, I can consider bidding on 4s or 6s. However, 2 8s is a relatively low bid, so I'll choose to increase the digit. Bidding 2 9s seems like a safe and reasonable next step.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s and two 9s. The current bid is 2 9s, which I can easily support with my own two 9s alone. Since the bid must increase, the safest next bid is 3 9s, which is plausible given I have two 9s myself and only need one more from the opponent's hand to make it true. This is a reasonable and strategic incremental raise.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (from 46392046), so the total count of 9s is at least 1. The bid of 3 9s implies there are at least 3 nines in total. I need to either challenge this bid or make a higher bid. Since I have some information about my hand, I can analyze the likelihood. I have 8 digits, and there's a total of 16 digits between both players. My hand has one 9. The expected average count for any digit across 16 digits is 1.6. While having 3 nines is possible, it's on the higher side but not impossible. However, I can make a higher bid. I can bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Bidding 4 0s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity and changes the digit to the lowest possible, making it a relatively safe bid given the current information.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (86435893), I have no 0s at all. The current bid is 4 0s, which would require the opponent to hold all four or more 0s across their 8 digits. Since the expected count of any specific digit across 16 digits is about 1.6, having four 0s is quite unlikely, especially given I have none. Therefore, the probability that there are at least 4 zeros overall is low, making a challenge the best move.
