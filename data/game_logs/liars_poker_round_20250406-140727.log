Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can make the first bid. I have the digits 0, 5, 1, 7, 0, 6, 5, 1 in my hand. I notice that I have two 0s, two 1s, and two 5s. A reasonable starting bid could be related to one of these digits. Bidding 3 0s seems like a safe and reasonable starting point as it reflects a count slightly above what I have, considering there are 3 players.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have 8 digits in my hand: 18973840. Looking at my hand, I can see I have one 0. The current bid is '3 0s', meaning Player 0 claims there are at least 3 zeros among all players' hands. Since I have 1 zero, this means Player 0 and Player 2 would need to have at least 2 more zeros between them for this bid to be valid. This is quite reasonable - each player has 8 digits, and zeros are common. I could challenge, but it's too early in the game and the bid is modest. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I could increase the quantity to 4 0s, but I don't have strong evidence for that. Alternatively, I could keep the quantity at 3 but increase the digit. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 3, one 4, one 7, one 8, and one 9. I'll bid '3 1s' since I already have one 1 in my hand, and it's a reasonable assumption that there could be at least 2 more 1s among the other 16 digits held by other players.

Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. My hand contains the digits 3, 6, 5, 5, 8, 2, 9, and 9. I can see that bidding 3 or more of a higher digit than 1 could be reasonable. Since I have two 9s and two 5s, but no 1s, I should consider a bid that reflects a higher quantity or digit. I have two 5s and two 9s, but no 1s or 2s or 3s or 4s or 6s or 7s or 8s or 0s. A safe bet would be to bid on a digit I have, increasing the quantity.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. My hand is 05170651, which contains one 5 and one 6, among other digits. I can see that I have a 6, and it's possible others might have 6s as well. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same while increasing the digit. Alternatively, I could bid 5 0s or higher, but I don't have strong evidence for a quantity increase. Given my hand and the current bid, bidding 4 6s seems like a safe and strategic move.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (18973840), I have zero 6s. The current bid claims there are at least 4 sixes among all players. Since I have none, all 4 would need to be distributed between the other two players, which is certainly possible but not guaranteed. However, rather than challenging, I think making a higher bid is safer at this stage. The game is still early, and I can bid 5 0s. I have two 0s in my hand, so I'm claiming there are at least 3 more 0s between the other players, which seems reasonable. This increases the quantity from 4 to 5, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24, and there are 8 secret digits per player, I must assess the likelihood of there being at least 5 zeros in total. Since the previous bids have been relatively low, I should consider the possibility that there are indeed a significant number of 0s. However, I also need to evaluate if my hand can support a bid. I have one 0 in my hand, but I also have other digits that could potentially be part of a higher bid. Considering my hand (36558289), I don't have enough information to accurately guess the distribution of digits among other players, but I can see if my bid could be reasonable based on my own digits.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I need to bid higher than this. I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand is 05170651, which contains one 1 and one 6. I have information about my own hand but not the others. Since the current bid is 6 1s, and there are 8 digits per player * 3 players = 24 total digits, a bid of 6 1s implies that roughly a quarter of the digits are 1s. I can increase the quantity to 7 or more, or keep it at 6 and bid a higher digit. Bidding 7 1s seems plausible as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, bidding 6 2s or higher is also an option. However, given that the previous bids have been relatively conservative and escalating, I should consider a reasonable increase. Bidding 7 1s is a significant increase and may be challenging to make given that it's more than a quarter of the total digits. I will analyze my hand and the bid history to make a decision. Since I have one 1, it's possible that the total count of 1s is around 3 (one in my hand and potentially two in others), making 6 1s a bit high but not entirely impossible. However, I can try to bid on a higher digit with the same quantity or slightly increase the quantity. I will choose to bid 6 2s as it is a higher digit and keeps the quantity the same.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to assess the likelihood of there being 6 2s in total. In my hand, I have only one 2. For the bid of '6 2s' to be valid, there would need to be 5 more 2s between the other two players' hands. Each player has 8 digits, so there are 24 total digits in play. The distribution of digits should be roughly even in the long run, meaning about 2-3 of each digit (24 digits รท 10 possible values). While 6 2s is possible, it's somewhat high. Looking at the bidding history, we've seen steady increases, with Player 0 just raising the digit from Player 2's '6 1s' to '6 2s'. I could bid '6 3s', '6 4s', etc., or increase the quantity to 7. Since I have one 3, one 4, and one 7 in my hand, I'll bid '6 3s' as a safer option than increasing the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid can be beaten. My hand contains 2 3s, 1 5, and 1 6, and other digits that could potentially add up. Given that the previous bids have been relatively conservative, I should consider if there's a possibility to make a higher bid without overestimating. The bid needs to be higher in quantity or digit. Since I have two 3s and the bid is 6 3s, I should think about challenging or making a slightly higher bid considering the digits I have.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 3s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand is 05170651, which contains two 3s and other digits. The count of 3s across all hands being at least 7 is plausible, but I should assess if I can make a higher bid based on my hand and the bid history. I see that increasing the digit to 4 or higher is a viable option. Since I have a 6 and a 7 in my hand, bidding 7 6s or 7 7s could be reasonable. However, I should be cautious not to overbid. Given that the current quantity is 7, I can bid 7 4s or higher digit. I'll choose to bid 7 7s as it's a higher digit and I have one 7 in my hand, making it somewhat plausible.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. In my hand, I have one 7 (18973840). The current bid is 7 7s, meaning Player 0 claims there are at least 7 sevens among all players. With 24 total digits in play and only 1 seven in my hand, there would need to be 6 more sevens between the other two players to make this bid valid. That's quite high but not impossible. Looking at the bid history, there's been steady escalation, but 7 7s is a significant jump from the previous 7 3s bid. Given that I have only 1 seven in my hand, and 7s would need to make up 29% of the remaining 16 digits between the other players, I think this bid is unlikely to be true. I'll challenge.
