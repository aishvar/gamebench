Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 19446711, which contains two 1s, one 4, two 6s, and one 7, and two other digits. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I see. I have two 1s and two 6s, so bidding on either is reasonable. I'll start with a bid of 3 1s as it's a relatively safe starting point, showing interest in the digit without being too aggressive.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid due to the higher digit. I have two 9s in my hand, so there's a possibility of at least one more 9 in other players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding higher in quantity with 9s is risky. I can bid 4 0s, which is a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 3 of a higher number than 9, such as 3 10s, but 10 is not a valid digit. Bidding 4 0s is the safest option as it doesn't rely on other players having 0s, and I have one 0 in my hand. I'm not confident enough to challenge 3 9s as other players could easily have 9s.

Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand of 8 digits, I have two 0s. The current bid is 4 0s, which would require at least two more zeros among the remaining 24 digits. Statistically, this is plausible, as the expected number of zeros per player is around 0.8 (8 digits Ã— 1/10 per player), totaling roughly 3.2 zeros overall. Since the bid of 4 zeros is reasonable, I should not challenge yet. Instead, I will increase the bid conservatively. I don't have many 1s or 9s, but I do have two 6s, so I can bid 4 6s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit).

Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (19446711), so I know there are at least 2 sixes. The total number of sixes across all players must be at least 2 (mine) plus some unknown number from other players. The bid of 4 6s is plausible because it is less than the total number of players times the number of cards per player (4 players * 8 cards = 32 total cards). I need to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. Since I have two 6s and the bid is 4 6s, it's possible that the total count of 6s is indeed 4 or more. However, I can bid higher by increasing the digit. I will bid 4 7s, as it's a valid higher bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. To raise, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same but choose a higher digit. My hand has two 9s, which is a higher digit than 7. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid with a better chance of being accurate given my holdings. Challenging is risky since the bid could be exactly met with my 1 7 and others having 3 more. Raising to 4 9s shifts the focus to a digit I hold more of.

Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. The previous bids were relatively low, and the increase to 4 9s is significant. It's quite possible Player 1 is bluffing. While I could bid higher, challenging seems like the more strategic play given my hand and the potentially inflated bid. Bidding higher would require me to assume others have 9s, which is unlikely given my hand.
