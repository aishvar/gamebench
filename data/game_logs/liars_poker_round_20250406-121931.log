Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 5s in my hand. Given that there are 32 digits in total and 8 digits per player, starting with a low bid seems reasonable.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Bidding higher than 2 5s is a reasonable strategy. I have two 4s, so bidding 3 4s would be a valid and plausible bid, potentially bluffing. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have, like 1 7s or 1 8s. However, bidding 3 4s seems more strategic as it's a reasonable quantity and I have some of that digit. Bidding 3 6s or higher is risky as I don't have those digits.

Requesting action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have two 4s in my hand (45420001). This means only one more 4 is needed among the other 24 digits held by the other 3 players for the bid to be accurate. The expected number of 4s among the remaining 24 digits is 2.4 (24 * 0.1). Therefore, finding at least one more 4 is highly likely, making a challenge risky. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains three 0s, which is a strong holding. Bidding 4 0s is a credible increase in quantity. It only requires one more 0 among the other 24 digits, which is statistically probable (expected 2.4). This seems like the strongest and safest bid based on my hand.

Requesting action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll base my decision on my hand and the current bid. I can see that there's at least one 0 in my hand, and it's possible others have 0s as well. However, increasing the quantity to 5 seems a bit high without knowing others' hands. I can bid on a higher digit, so bidding 4 1s is a reasonable next step as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have two 1s in my hand (51499538). Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 4 players with 8 digits each, I should consider the likelihood of there being at least 4 1s in total. Since I don't have enough information about other players' hands, I will make a conservative bid that is higher than the current bid. I will bid 5 2s, as it seems reasonable and higher than the current bid of 4 1s.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free) bids: 5 2s

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have a 2 in my hand. Bidding 6 2s is a reasonable increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have one 3, two 4s, one 5, one 7, one 8 and one 0. Bidding 6 2s seems like the most logical play as it leverages the 2 I have and increases the bid in a straightforward manner. Bidding on other digits would require more speculation about other players' hands.

Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) bids: 6 2s

--- Turn: Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. I hold one 2 in my hand (45420001). There are 32 digits total across 4 players. The expected number of any digit is 3.2 (32/10). A bid of 6 is significantly higher than the expected value. For the bid to be true, there must be at least 5 more 2s among the other 24 digits held by the other 3 players. The expected number of 2s in those 24 digits is only 2.4 (24/10). While Player 0 previously bid 5 2s and Player 1 raised to 6 2s, suggesting they might hold some 2s, a total count of 6 seems statistically unlikely. Making a higher bid, such as 6 3s (I have none), 6 4s (I have two, needing 4 more from others), or 7 of any digit, feels even riskier. Therefore, challenging the current high bid is the most prudent action.
