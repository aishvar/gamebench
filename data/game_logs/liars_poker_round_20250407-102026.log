Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, two 9s, one 0, one 5, one 7, and one 3. A safe and strong opening bid is to choose a digit I have multiple copies of, such as 6 or 9. I will start with a conservative bid of 2 6s, reflecting my hand and leaving room for escalation.
