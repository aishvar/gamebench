--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, meaning the total must be at least three. If Player 1 has two 6s, the bid is valid. However, if they have fewer, the bid is invalid. Given the uncertainty and the risk of making a higher bid, challenging is a safer option to potentially expose a bluff.
