Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s seems like a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 6.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which seems plausible given there are 16 total digits in play. To stay in the game and increase the bid, I can bid 4 6s, as it is a valid higher bid and aligns with the possibility of there being additional 6s in Player 0's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Since the previous bid was 3 6s, it's likely that the other player has at least one 6. Bidding 5 6s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on the likelihood that the other player has at least one 6.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 5 6s, which means there must be at least five 6s across both players' hands. Since I only have one, Player 0 would need to have at least four 6s for the bid to be valid. This seems plausible but not guaranteed. However, instead of challenging, I can make a higher bid to maintain control of the game. I will bid 5 7s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have two 6s in my hand, which means there are at least two 6s in play. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can bid 6 6s, increasing the quantity while keeping the same digit. This seems like a reasonable and safe bid given my hand and the bid history.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, and the current bid is 6 6s. Based on the bid history, Player 0 seems confident in 6s, and I only see one in my hand. It is plausible that the bid could be valid, but increasing the bid to 7 6s would push the quantity closer to the maximum without a strong basis from my hand. Instead, I will bid 6 7s, maintaining the quantity but increasing the digit, as I have two 7s in my hand, which makes this a reasonable progression.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have two 6s in my hand. Since the opponent has increased the digit to 7, I should consider challenging if I believe the bid is unlikely. However, since I have no 7s, I should bid cautiously. Bidding 7 6s is a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s, and I have only one 6 in my hand. This means there must be at least six more 6s in Player 0's hand to meet the bid, which seems plausible but not guaranteed. However, I can make a higher bid to maintain pressure. Since I have two 0s in my hand, I can bid 7 0s, which is a valid move because it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit. This also shifts the focus away from 6s, which I suspect Player 0 may not have enough of to support their bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have only one 6 in my hand, and the current bid is 7 6s. This means there would need to be at least six more 6s in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. Given that there are a total of 16 digits in play, it seems unlikely that Player 0 has six or more 6s. Challenging the bid is the best option.
