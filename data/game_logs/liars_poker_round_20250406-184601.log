Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits 5, 4, 3, 9, 8, 9, 8, 2. Counting the digits, I have two 8s and two 9s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. A safe opening bid would be 2 8s or 2 9s, but to be slightly more aggressive, I will bid 3 of a digit I have multiple of. Given that, bidding 3 8s is a reasonable opening bid, assuming the opponent might have at least one 8 in their hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, meaning the total must be at least 3. I only have one, so the opponent must have at least two. Given the uncertainty and the risk, challenging seems like a reasonable move.
