Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid and there is no current bid to exceed, I can start with any valid bid. My hand contains two 4s, so I can confidently bid on the digit 4 with a quantity of 2, knowing that the maximum possible 4s in the game is 4 (if the other player also has two 4s).

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (31795259), I have 0 fours. The current bid is '2 4s', meaning the opponent claims there are at least 2 fours in total between both our hands. Since I have 0 fours, that means all claimed fours would have to be in the opponent's hand. With 8 digits in their hand, it's certainly possible they have 2 or more fours. Since this is the first bid and it's relatively conservative (only claiming 2 fours out of a possible 16 digits), I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. I can bid either a higher quantity of 4s or any quantity of a higher digit (5-9). Looking at my hand, I have one 5, one 9, one 7, and no 6s or 8s. I'll bid '2 5s' since I already have one 5 in my hand, making it a safer bid than claiming digits I don't have.

Player 1 bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. My hand contains no 5s, and the maximum possible 5s across both hands is 2 (if Player 1 has 2). Bidding higher is impossible, and challenging is the only logical move since the current bid is already at the maximum possible quantity for 5s.
