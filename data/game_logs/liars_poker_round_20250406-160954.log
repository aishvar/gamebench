Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, two 0s, two 8s, one 2, one 3, one 5, and one 7. The most frequent digits are 0, 4, and 8 with two occurrences each. Opening with a conservative bid of 2 4s seems reasonable given my hand, as it is supported by my own cards and leaves room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. My hand is 19807061. I have zero 4s. For the current bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least two 4s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, challenging seems reasonable as they need both 4s. However, it's early in the game. I have two 0s and two 1s in my hand. Bidding based on my own strong digits is a good strategy. Bidding '3 0s' requires only one 0 from the opponent's hand (out of 8 digits), which is statistically likely (expected value is 0.8). This bid is higher than '2 4s' (higher quantity), leverages my hand's strength, and puts pressure back on the opponent without taking the immediate risk of a challenge.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0 (the fifth digit). The current bid is 3 zeros, so I need to consider whether 3 zeros in total is plausible. Since I have 1 zero, the opponent would need to have at least 2 zeros among their 8 digits. That is plausible, so challenging is risky. To outbid, I can either bid 3 1s or 4 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s (digits 4 and 8), two 0s (only one), two 3s (only one), two 2s (only one), two 5s (only one), two 7s (only one), and two 8s (two of them). Since I have two 8s, bidding 3 8s is reasonable, but that doesn't outbid 3 0s since digit 8 > 0 at same quantity is a valid raise. So, I will bid 3 8s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (19807061). For the bid to be true, the opponent needs at least two 8s in their 8-digit hand, which is plausible. Challenging seems risky. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 3 9s or 4 of any digit. I have two 0s and previously bid 3 0s. Bidding 4 0s is a reasonable escalation based on my hand (requiring the opponent to have two 0s) and reinforces my previous bid, potentially making my opponent believe I hold three 0s.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 3, 2, 7, 5, 4, 0, 8, 4. I only have one 0. The current bid is 4 0s, which would require at least three zeros in the opponent's hand. Since the average number of any specific digit across 16 digits is about 1.6, having four zeros total is somewhat unlikely, especially since I only have one. Given this, the bid seems risky for the bidder, so challenging is the best move.
