Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s, two 0s, and one each of 1, 7, and 8. Since this is the first bid and I need to establish a baseline, I should bid based on what I know for certain. Two 6s is a conservative but strategic opening bid, as it's based on what I actually have while leaving room for higher bids later.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 42029912, I have no 6s. Since the current bid is only 2 6s, it's quite plausible that the opponent has two or more 6s, so challenging now is risky. A safe higher bid would be to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have two 2s, so bidding 2 9s (since I also have two 9s) is a valid strictly higher bid with some support from my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I don't have any 9s in my hand. The opponent bid '2 9s', which means they're claiming there are at least 2 nines total. Since I have no 9s, they would need to have at least 2 nines in their hand for this to be true. While possible, it's somewhat risky for them to bid this early on a digit they might not have many of. I could bid higher, but since I don't have any 9s myself and they're claiming multiple 9s, challenging here seems like a good strategic move.
