Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 1s, which is a relatively high count for a single digit in my hand. Given that there are 16 digits in total and I have 8 of them, bidding on a low quantity of a high digit seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 2 1s. Bidding 2 4s is a higher bid because 4 is greater than 1, and I can confirm at least two 4s exist in my hand alone.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s made by Player 1. My hand contains the digits 7, 6, 1, 1, 2, 8, 9, 3. I have two 1s, which I previously bid as 2 1s. Since the bid of 2 4s is low, and I don't have any 4s in my hand, I should consider increasing the bid. I can see that bidding a higher quantity or digit could be strategic. Given that I have two 1s and the current bid is 2 4s, I could bid higher with a digit I have. I will bid 3 1s as I have two 1s and it seems like a reasonable increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 3 1s. Bidding 3 4s is a higher digit with the same quantity, which is a valid move. It's reasonable to assume the total could be at least three since I have two and the opponent might have one.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s made by Player 1. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. My hand contains the digits 7, 6, 1, 1, 2, 8, 9, 3. I have two 1s, which I can use to make a reasonable bid. Since the current bid is 3 4s, I can increase either the quantity or the digit. Bidding 4 1s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and I have two 1s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '1' in my hand, so Player 0 must have three '1's for the bid to be valid. Considering the bid history and the possibility that Player 0 might be bluffing, challenging seems like a reasonable move.
