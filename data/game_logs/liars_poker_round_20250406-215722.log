Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, and I know the other player has at most one 0 in their hand. Therefore, the bid of 1 0s is valid. However, I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 3 3s is a reasonable next step, increasing both the quantity and the digit.
