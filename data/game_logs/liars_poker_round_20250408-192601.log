Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: No bid has been made yet and it's my opening turn. In my hand '41860954', I have two 4s and one of each of the other digits. Bidding '2 4s' is safe since I'm certain I already hold the two 4s, which guarantees the bid is valid regardless of the opponentâ€™s digits.
