Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have one 6, so bidding 1 6s is a safe starting point that doesn't risk overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (76728248). The opponent bid '1 6s', which is a very conservative opening bid. Given that I have one 6 myself, there are very likely to be at least 2 6s total between our hands. Making a bid of '2 6s' would be a safe play that builds on the confirmed information while keeping the quantity manageable.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s, which is plausible since there are 16 total digits in play. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit to 7s seems safer as I have one 7 in my hand, making the bid 2 7s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand (position 0). The opponent bid '2 7s', and I can directly verify this is accurate since I have one 7. Given that this is a valid bid and I know there are at least 2 sevens total, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, which allows me to confidently bid '2 8s' - keeping the same quantity but using a higher digit.

Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s. Given that there are 16 digits in total (8 per player), it's possible the other player has at least one more 8, making the bid valid. However, since I only have one, I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding 3 8s seems risky without knowing the opponent's hand, but challenging now might be premature. A safer move would be to bid a higher digit where I have more cards, like 3 6s (I have two 6s in my hand).

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 76728248, I have zero 6s. The opponent has bid '3 6s', claiming there are at least 3 sixes total. Given that I have zero 6s in my hand, this means all 3 claimed sixes would need to be in the opponent's hand. While possible, this seems unlikely as it would mean over 1/3 of their hand is sixes. Additionally, looking at the bid history, the opponent started with '1 6s', then went to '2 7s' when challenged, and has now returned to claiming '3 6s' - this pattern suggests potential bluffing. Given these factors, challenging seems like the best option.
