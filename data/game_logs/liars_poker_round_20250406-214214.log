Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 3, one 4, two 5s, one 7, one 2, one 8, and one 9. The strongest starting bid would be based on the digit I have the most of, which is two 5s. Since there are 16 digits in total, a conservative and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '2 5s' by Player 0, I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Looking at my hand, 69413127, I notice I don't have any 5s, which makes challenging the current bid of '2 5s' less risky since I have no contribution to the count of 5s. However, without knowing Player 0's hand, it's difficult to assess the likelihood of the bid being true. Considering the game has just started and the bid is relatively low, it might be beneficial to bid higher to put pressure on Player 0 and gain more information. Since I have two 1s and other digits, bidding on a digit I have could be strategic, but given the low current bid, I should aim to increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding on a digit I have in higher quantity or a higher digit seems like a good strategy. However, since I don't have a clear advantage with any digit to confidently bid higher without risking too much, and considering the current bid is not extremely high, challenging might be a safer option to test Player 0's confidence and hand strength early in the game.
