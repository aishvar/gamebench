Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I need to make the first bid. I have one 1, one 3, two 4s, one 7, one 9, and one 0 in my hand. A conservative bid would be 1 0s, but I want to make a slightly more aggressive bid to gain information. I'll bid 2 1s, as I have one 1 in my hand and it's a reasonable starting point.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s, which is a low quantity and digit. Considering my hand, I have two 1s and other digits that could contribute to a higher count. I should bid a higher quantity and digit to increase my chances of winning.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. To make a valid bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 3s is possible, but might be risky. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 4 4s is a valid and reasonable option, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same as the current bid.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have two 6s and one 4 in my hand. Given the current bid is only 4 4s, I can safely bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Bidding 5 4s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 6 4s would be a reasonable increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have one 7, one 9, two 1s, and two 3s. Bidding 3 7s or 3 9s would be higher than 5 4s. Considering my hand, increasing the quantity of 4s seems most plausible. However, 6 4s might be too aggressive. I will bid 3 7s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 6 4s would be a reasonable increase, as it's a higher quantity of the same digit. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have one 7, so bidding 2 7s is a possibility, but less likely to succeed than increasing the 4s bid. Given the history, the other player seems willing to bid high on 4s, so I will continue that trend.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have 4 fours in my hand. The current bid is 6 4s, which seems likely. However, I have a chance to increase the quantity, so I'll bid 7 4s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 7 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 4s. I have two 4s in my hand. The previous bids show a clear escalation on the 4s, and Player 1 seems confident. Bidding 8 4s is a logical next step, as it increases the quantity. It's a risky bid, but given the history, it's likely to deter a challenge. Bidding a different digit would be less strategic, as the game has focused on 4s for several rounds.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 8 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 4s. I have 4 fours in my hand which is the highest digit in my hand. I can bid higher quantity or same quantity but higher digit. Since I have 4 fours, I can bid 4 5s, increasing the digit to 5. This seems like a reasonable move.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 4s. I have 4 in my hand. Bidding 9 4s is a reasonable increase in quantity, as I have one more 4 in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 4S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 9 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 4s. I have two 4s in my hand. It's unlikely there are 9 total 4s given the previous bids and my hand. While I could bid higher, challenging seems like the more strategic move. The opponent has been aggressively bidding 4s, and it's likely they are bluffing. A challenge will either reveal their bluff or confirm a surprisingly high number of 4s, allowing me to adjust my strategy accordingly.
