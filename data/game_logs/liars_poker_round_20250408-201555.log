Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible. Since it's early in the bidding and raising is low risk, I can safely increase the bid by either raising the digit or the quantity. I will raise the digit to 1 1s, which is the minimal legal higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 16739420, I have one 1, one 2, and one 0. The current bid is 1 2s, which is plausible. To increase the bid, I can either bid 1 3s or increase the quantity. Since I have one 3, bidding 1 3s is a safe minimal raise. Alternatively, I could bid 2 0s, as I have one 0 and it's likely there is at least one more between both hands. Bidding 2 0s increases the quantity, making it a strictly higher bid and reasonable based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 16739420, I have one '1'. The current bid is 2 1s, meaning there must be at least two '1's in total. Since I have one, the opponent likely has at least one, which is plausible. To raise, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Looking at my hand, I have two '0's, which supports a bid of 3 0s. This is a safe and natural progression, increasing the quantity while switching back to a digit I have good coverage on.
