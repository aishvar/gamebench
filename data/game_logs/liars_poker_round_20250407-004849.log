Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 50681667, I have two 6s. Since this is the opening bid and I have direct knowledge of two 6s, making a conservative bid of 3 6s is reasonable. This suggests there only needs to be one more 6 in the opponent's hand, which is fairly likely. The bid of 3 6s establishes a moderate starting position while being backed by my actual holdings.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 6s (digits are 3, 2, 1, 0, 5, 4, 8, 4). Since I hold zero 6s, the opponent would need to have all 3 or more 6s in their hand to make the bid valid, which is unlikely. The probability of one player holding three or more of a single digit out of 8 is low. Therefore, I believe the bid of 3 6s is unlikely to be true, so the optimal move is to challenge.
