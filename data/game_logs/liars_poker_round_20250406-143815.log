Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. As the first bidder, starting with 3 6s is a reasonable claim, giving myself a chance to be correct if the opponent has at least one 6. This bid balances aggression with plausibility.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '70012429', I have zero 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, so for that bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least 3 6s. Since the total digits are 16 and I hold none, it's unlikely the opponent has all 3 or more 6s. Statistically, an average hand would have roughly 1-2 occurrences of any digit, so 3 6s in one hand is possible but improbable. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
