--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand '20052947', I have two 0s, one 2, one 5, one 9, one 4, one 7, and one 3. The most common digit in my hand is 0, appearing twice. With 24 digits total among all players, it's statistically reasonable to expect at least three 0s overall. Therefore, I will start with a conservative opening bid of 3 0s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I need to determine if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is the best option. My hand contains the digits 8, 4, 0, 6, 3, 9, 3, and 7. I have two 0s and three 3s, but no other digits appear more than once. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24, and there are only 8 digits in my hand, I should consider the possibility of higher quantity bids or challenging if the bid seems unlikely. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should look for a digit that appears multiple times in my hand and consider bidding on that. I have two 0s, so bidding on 0s seems reasonable. However, I should also consider if there's a possibility that the other players have more 0s than I do, which could make my bid risky.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 4 0s. Since I have no 0s, challenging seems risky. Bidding 5 1s is a reasonable move, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity modest.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 1S'
Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (20052947), I have one '1'. The current bid is 5 1s, which means across all 24 digits, there must be at least five 1s. Given I have only one, it would require the other two players to collectively hold at least four 1s. Statistically, expecting 5 or more 1s total is plausible but somewhat risky, as the average count per digit across 24 digits is about 2.4. Since the bid jumped from 4 0s to 5 1s, and I only see one 1, it's reasonable to challenge this bid rather than risk making an unlikely higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 2's (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bid of 5 1s.
