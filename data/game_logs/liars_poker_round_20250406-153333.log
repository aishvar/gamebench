Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game, so I want to start with a conservative but plausible bid. In my hand, I have one 0, two 6s, one 2, two 8s, one 1, one 3, and one 5. The digit 6 appears twice, which is relatively strong. Since there are 16 digits in total, starting with a bid of 3 6s is reasonable, expecting the opponent to have at least one 6.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have a lot of 6s or higher digits, I'll increase the quantity. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move as it is strictly higher than the current bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 56280163, I have two 6s. The current bid is 4 6s, which means there must be at least two more 6s in Player 1's hand to make the bid valid. Given the distribution of digits, it's somewhat plausible but not certain. A total of four 6s is a moderately aggressive bid but not outrageous. Since I have two 6s myself, it's risky to challenge now. Instead, I will increase the bid conservatively by raising the digit while keeping the quantity, moving to 4 7s, which is the minimal legal raise.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I don't have information about the exact count of 7s or higher digits in the other player's hand, I'll analyze my hand to make an informed decision. I see that I have multiple lower digits, but not many higher ones. I can bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable move as it doesn't require me to have a high count of the digit, and it's a higher bid than 4 7s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (56280163), I have one 8. The current bid is 4 8s, implying there should be at least three 8s in my opponent's hand, which seems unlikely given typical distribution. Since 8s are relatively rare and I hold only one, the probability that the total reaches four is low. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
