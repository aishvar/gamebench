Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s, two 5s, one 9, one 1, one 6, and one 3 in my hand, but only one 0. The current bid is 1 0s, which is quite safe and likely true given I have one 0 myself. To increase the bid, I can either bid 1 1s (same quantity, higher digit) or increase quantity. Since I have one 1, bidding 1 1s is a safe minimal raise.
