Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a low bid. I have two 0s in my hand, so bidding 3 0s seems like a safe starting point.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s. For the current bid of 3 0s to be valid, the opponent would need at least one 0, which is quite plausible. Raising the bid slightly is safe given my two 0s, and bidding 3 1s (same quantity, higher digit) is a minimal legal raise. However, since I also have two 6s and two 9s, I can make a stronger bid based on those digits. A bid of 3 6s is safe as I already hold two 6s, and it's a strictly higher bid than 3 0s. This keeps me in the game without overcommitting.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I could bid 4 0s, 4 1s, 4 2s, 4 4s, or 4 8s. I could also bid 3 of 7, 8, 9. I will bid 4 0s, since I have one 0 in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '03196569', I have one 0 and two 6s. The current bid is 4 0s, which requires there to be at least four zeroes across both hands. Since I only have one 0, that would require my opponent to have at least three zeroes, which is quite unlikely given the distribution. It is safer to challenge this bid rather than making a higher, riskier bid.
