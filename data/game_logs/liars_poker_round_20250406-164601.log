--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 2, two 4s, one 3, one 5, one 6, and one 9. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 4s, as I already hold two 4s myself, making this bid certainly true and putting slight pressure on the opponent.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 2 4s. Bidding 3 4s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 54219463, I have one 4. The current bid is 3 4s, so for that bid to be valid, there must be at least two more 4s in Player 1's hand. This is plausible, as on average each digit appears roughly 1.6 times per player. Since I only have one 4, it's risky to challenge now. The minimal higher bid would be 3 5s, and I have one 5, so it's reasonable to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have a 5 in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. I can increase the quantity to 4 5s, making a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 5. The current bid is 4 5s, meaning there must be at least three 5s in the opponent's hand, which is quite unlikely given only 8 digits. Since I only have one 5, and 4 total seems improbable, I will challenge the bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 1's (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bid of 4 5s.
