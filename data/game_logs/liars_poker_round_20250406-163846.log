Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains the digits 1, 7, 4, 3, 9, 5, 7, and 4. I see that I have two 7s and two 4s and one 5. A reasonable starting bid could be 2 7s or 2 4s or 2 5s or 2 4s, as these are digits I have in my hand. However, I should start with a low quantity to test the waters. I will bid 2 4s as my starting bid because I have two 4s in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. My hand has no 4s, so the opponent must have at least two 4s in their 8 digits. The probability of them having two or more 4s is low (only ~15% chance with random distribution). Challenging is likely to win since it's unlikely they have two 4s.
