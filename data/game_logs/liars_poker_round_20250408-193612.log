Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I see three 0s (digits: 2,1,3,7,3,0,6,0). Since the current bid is only 1 0s, and I already hold three myself, it's very safe to increase the bid. The next valid bid can be 2 0s or higher, but given my strong holding, I can confidently bid 3 0s to pressure the opponent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 21373060, I have zero 1s. Since the current bid is 3 1s, all three would have to be in Player 0's hand, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. The expected number of 1s in their hand is roughly 0.8 (since each digit is equally likely). Therefore, the probability that there are 3 or more 1s overall is low, making this a good spot to challenge.
