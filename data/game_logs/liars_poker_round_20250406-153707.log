Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening bid and there are no prior bids, I want to start with a conservative yet reasonable bid. In my hand, I have one 3, one 0, one 6, one 7, one 9, one 4, one 5, and one 3. So, I have two 3s. Statistically, with 16 total digits, a starting bid of 3 of a common digit is typical. Given I have two 3s, it's reasonable to open with 3 3s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have the digits 66912017 in my hand, which contains one 3 and no higher frequency of any digit greater than 3. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I see two 6s and no other high-frequency digits besides that, bidding 3 6s seems like a reasonable move as it increases the digit and keeps the quantity the same.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6. The current bid is 3 6s, which implies there are at least two more 6s in the opponent's hand. This is plausible. To increase the bid, I can either bid 3 7s or raise the quantity. Since I have one 7 as well, bidding 3 7s is reasonable, as it only requires two more 7s in the opponent's hand, which is not unlikely at this stage.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have two 6s and no 8s or 9s, increasing the quantity to 4 with a digit less than 7 (but higher than 6) isn't feasible. However, I can bid 4 7s, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same, which is a valid higher bid. Alternatively, I can challenge if I think the bid is too high. Given that I have one 7, it's plausible that the total count could be 3 or more, so challenging might not be the best option unless the next bid seems too aggressive. Bidding 4 7s seems like a reasonable move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (63037945), I have one 7. The current bid is 4 7s, so for that bid to be valid, there must be at least 3 more 7s in Player 1's hand. Since each player only has 8 digits, it's unlikely Player 1 has 3 or more 7s, as that would mean nearly half of their hand consists of 7s. Given the distribution, it's improbable there are 4 or more 7s total. Therefore, challenging is the best move.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 1's (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bid of 4 7s.
