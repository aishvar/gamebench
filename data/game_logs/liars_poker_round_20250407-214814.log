Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, one 0, one 1, one 2, one 5, one 6, and one 8. The most frequent digit in my hand is 4, appearing twice. A good opening bid is usually a conservative estimate based on my hand, assuming the opponent has at least one or two of the same digit. Therefore, bidding 3 of 4s is a reasonable and safe opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Let me analyze this carefully: 1) I have zero 4s in my hand (28392716). 2) The opponent claims there are at least 3 fours total. 3) Since I have no 4s, all 3 claimed 4s would need to be in the opponent's hand. 4) The probability of the opponent having exactly 3 or more 4s in their 8 digits is relatively low. 5) This being the first bid, they may be bluffing to establish dominance. 6) Given I know for certain there are 0 fours in my hand, and they'd need 3 in theirs, I believe this is a good challenge opportunity.
