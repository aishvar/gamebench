Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand, making it the most frequent digit I hold. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable starting point as it's likely to be valid, especially if the opponent has at least one 5. This bid balances being high enough to be credible but not so high as to immediately provoke a challenge without cause.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 11060416, I have zero 5s. The opponent bid '3 5s', claiming there are at least 3 fives total. Since I have none, all 3 would need to be in their hand of 8 digits, which is possible but seems unlikely. However, with only one bid made so far and the quantity being relatively low (3), it's too early to challenge. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding '3 6s' is a safe play - it's a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) that I'm confident exists based on my hand alone.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 6s. Challenging is chosen because making a higher bid would require uncertain assumptions about Player 1's hand, while challenging directly tests the validity of the current bid.
