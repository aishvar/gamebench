Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 5s and two 6s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 2 5s is reasonable as it's based on my actual cards and leaves room for others to raise.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have a 5 in my hand, which means there is at least one 5 in the pool. Given that I don't have enough information about the other players' hands, I should bid slightly higher than the current bid to test the waters. My hand contains one 5, so bidding 3 5s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 43494321, which contains two 3s, two 4s, one 9, one 1, and one 2. There are no 5s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I don't have any 5s, I will bid on a higher digit. Bidding 3 6s is a valid move as it is a higher digit than 5. However, I should also consider the likelihood of 6s being present in other hands. Given that I have two 4s and the current bid is on 5s, it's plausible that there could be 6s as well. Thus, bidding 3 6s seems like a reasonable next step.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand (from 56506867). The current bid is 3 6s. To make a higher bid, I can increase the quantity to 4 6s or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit to 7s or higher. Since I already have three 6s, it's likely there are more in other players' hands, so bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. I should consider the likelihood of there being at least 4 6s in total. Given that I only have one 6, and without knowing the exact distribution of digits among other players, I need to assess if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I must evaluate the risk and potential. Bidding 5 7s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit, and it's possible that not all players have as many 6s or higher digits.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. My hand is 43494321, which contains two 7s (one in '7' and none, since there are no 7s, actually there's one '4' that is not a 7). I see that the bidding has escalated from 2 5s to 5 7s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. I have two relevant digits in my hand and the total count across all players must be considered. Bidding 6 7s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity. I will bid 6 7s.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free) bids: 6 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand (from 56506867). The current bid is 6 7s, which is quite high. Given that there are 24 digits in total, and assuming an even distribution, it's unlikely that there are 6 or more 7s across all players. However, since I have two, it's possible but risky. I could bid 6 8s, but I only have one 8 in my hand, making it even riskier. Therefore, the best move is to challenge the current bid.
