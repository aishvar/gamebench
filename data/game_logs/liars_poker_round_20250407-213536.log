Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: For my opening bid, I should analyze my hand and make a strategic first move. In my hand, I have one '4', one '0', one '9', one '5', one '7', one '6', and one '1'. A good opening strategy is to bid on a digit I have at least one of, but not too high to leave room for the game to develop. I see I have one '4', and bidding two '4's is reasonable since it only requires my opponent to have one more '4' to be valid, which is quite possible.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. Looking at my hand (80733036), I have zero 4s. Since I hold half the digits and none are 4s, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have all 2 or more 4s. While it's possible, it's unlikely given the distribution. Since the minimum to meet the bid is 2 4s and I have none, challenging is a reasonable strategic move rather than increasing the bid.
