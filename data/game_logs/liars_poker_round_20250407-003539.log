Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (28181976), I see multiple 1s and 8s. Bidding 4 1s seems reasonable as it's a safe starting point, considering the possibility of my opponent having at least one 1 in their hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 1s. Given the total of 16 digits in the game and that I hold zero, the opponent would need to have all 4 or more 1s alone to satisfy the current bid, which is unlikely. Since the probability of there being at least 4 ones without any in my hand is quite low, the best move is to challenge.
