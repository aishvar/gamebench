Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening bid and no bids have been made yet, I want to start with a conservative but strong bid based on my hand. My hand contains two 1s, two 8s, one 5, one 2, one 7, and one 0. The most frequent digits are '1' and '8', each appearing twice. A reasonable opening bid is 2 of either '1' or '8'. I'll choose '1' as my opening bid because it's a common digit and gives me a solid base to build upon or challenge later.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 1s'. I have no 1s in my hand. The maximum possible quantity of 1s is 8, as each player has 8 digits. Since the opponent has bid '2 1s', it is likely they have at least one 1 in their hand. However, it is unlikely that they have two 1s, as this would be a very specific and unlikely scenario. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
