Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains the digits 2, 9, 5, 3, 6, 9, 0, and 6. I see that I have two 6s and two 9s. The highest possible digit I have is 9. I will start with a conservative bid that could be valid given my hand.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s, and I have one 9 in my hand. Given that there are 16 digits in total, it is plausible that there is at least one more 9 in Player 0's hand, making the bid of 2 9s reasonable. To maintain the flow of the game, I will increase the bid to 3 9s, as it is a logical next step based on my hand and the likelihood of additional 9s existing.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I need to make a higher bid. I have a few 9s in my hand, but not enough to guarantee a win if challenged. However, I can try to make a reasonable bid based on my hand and the information available. Since my hand contains a 9 and I know there are at least 3 9s in total (from the current bid), I should consider bidding higher than 3 9s. I can see if I can increase the quantity or the digit. My hand has one 9, so I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. A reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity or the digit slightly, considering my hand and the risk of being challenged.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. Looking at my hand, I have one 0. Since there are 16 digits in total across both players, it is plausible that there could be 4 0s, but it is not guaranteed. However, I can safely increase the bid by focusing on a digit I have more of. I have two 4s in my hand, so bidding 4 4s seems like a reasonable move to increase the digit while maintaining the same quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 4S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that this bid can be beaten. My hand contains the digits 2, 9, 5, 3, 6, 9, 0, 6. I have two 6s and two 9s, and other digits appear once or not at all. The bid of 4 4s seems high but I have to consider if I can safely bid higher. Since I have two 9s and the last bid was 4 4s, I can try to bid higher with a digit I have in hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. In my hand, I have two 6s. This means there need to be at least 3 more 6s in Player 0's hand for the bid to hold true. While this is possible, it seems somewhat risky to challenge at this point because 5 is not an implausibly high quantity. To maintain the pressure and stay in the game, I will make a higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, bidding 5 8s, as I also have two 8s in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that this bid can be beaten. My hand contains the digits 2, 9, 5, 3, 6, 9, 0, 6. I have two 6s and two 9s, and other digits appear once or not at all. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and with 8 digits in my hand, I can only account for a maximum of 8 of my digits. The current bid of 5 8s seems high but I have to consider if it can be beaten with a higher quantity or digit. Since I have two 9s and the last bid was 5 8s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. A bid of 6 9s seems reasonable as I have two 9s in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s, which means there must be at least six 9s across both hands. In my hand, I have no 9s, which makes it very unlikely that Player 0 has all six or more. Since the maximum total is 16 digits, and I have zero 9s, Player 0 would need to have six or more 9s in their hand alone, which seems improbable. Therefore, I should challenge this bid.
