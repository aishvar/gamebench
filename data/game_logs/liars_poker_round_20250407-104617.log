Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s (digits '8 0 5 0 7 3 2 8'). Since the current bid is only 1 0s, I know there are at least two 0s in total. Therefore, a safe and natural higher bid is 2 0s, which is strictly higher and well-supported by my hand.
