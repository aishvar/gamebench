Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 20459690. I count 2 zeros, 1 two, 1 four, 1 five, 1 six, 1 nine. The most frequent digit in my hand is not significantly more than others, but I see two 0s. A reasonable starting bid could be the count of the most frequent digit I see, which is 2. I will bid on 2 0s as it's a relatively safe starting point and doesn't reveal too much about my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. I can safely bid 3 1s, increasing both the quantity and the digit, and it's unlikely to be challenged immediately.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand (20459690). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I see one 1, it's possible there are at least 3 1s in total. I will increase the quantity to 4 and bid on 1s again because I think it's likely there are more 1s. Alternatively, bidding 3 2s is also an option, but I choose to stick with the same digit and increase the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand (implied since it's not listed). I could bid 4 2s, which is a valid increase. However, since the bid is already at 4, I'll increase the quantity to 5 and bid 5 2s. This is a safe increase and avoids a potential challenge.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have one 2 in my hand (20459690). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have many 2s or higher digits in abundance, I'll consider increasing the digit. I see that I have multiple instances of higher digits like 5, 6, and 9. Bidding 5 5s seems reasonable as it keeps the quantity the same while increasing the digit, and I have two 5s in my hand, making it somewhat plausible.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. It's possible there are at least five 5s in total, but it's also possible Player 0 is bluffing. I could bid higher, but I'm not confident enough to bid a significantly higher quantity. Given the risk, I will challenge.
