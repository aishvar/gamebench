Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid and I have to make the first move, I should analyze my hand to make an informed bid. My hand is 06723446. I count the occurrences of each digit: 0(1), 1(0), 2(1), 3(1), 4(3), 5(0), 6(2), 7(1), 8(0), 9(0). I have a total of 3 fours and 2 sixes, which are relatively high counts. A reasonable starting bid could be on the digit with the highest count in my hand, which is 4. I have 3 fours, so bidding '4 4s' seems like a reasonable starting point as it slightly exceeds my count, accounting for the possibility that the other player might also have some fours.
