Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand (36645601), the digit '6' appears three times, which is the highest frequency of any digit in my hand. Opening with a bid on '6' leverages my knowledge and sets a reasonable starting point. An initial bid of 3 sixes is conservative yet strong, as it's likely there are at least a few additional '6's in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 sixes. I need to either bid higher or challenge. I don't have any sixes in my hand. The maximum possible number of sixes is 16. 3 sixes is a relatively low bid, so it's likely that there are at least 3 sixes between both hands. I should bid higher. I can bid 4 of any number. I will bid 4 0s since I have a 0 in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 sixes. I don't have any sixes in my hand. The maximum number of sixes that could exist is 16. I need to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. I will bid higher to test my opponent. I will bid 4 sixes.

Player 1 bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains three 6s (digits: 3, 6, 6, 4, 5, 6, 0, 1). The current bid is 4 sixes, which requires at least one more six in Player 1's hand to be valid. Since I hold 3, it's plausible Player 1 has at least one six, making the bid reasonable. To continue the game and avoid a risky challenge, I can safely increase the quantity of sixes to 5, which is still quite plausible given 16 total digits. Alternatively, I could increase the digit to a higher one with at least 4 quantity, but increasing quantity is simpler and safer here.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. To bid, I need to increase the quantity or the digit. I could bid 6 0s, as I have one 0. However, given that the bidding has already reached 5, it seems unlikely that there are only 5 sixes in total. It might be safer to challenge, hoping the other player is bluffing. There is a chance they have multiple sixes, but the risk of bidding higher and then facing a challenge myself seems greater.
