Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game, so I need to start with a reasonable bid. My hand contains two 7s, one 6, one 9, and other digits. A safe and logical opening bid would be 3 7s, as I already have two 7s in my hand, and it's likely the other player has at least one.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, and with only 8 unknown digits in the opponentâ€™s hand, the probability that there are three or more 7s in total is extremely low (around 3.8%). This makes the current bid of '3 7s' very unlikely to be true, so challenging is the sound move.
