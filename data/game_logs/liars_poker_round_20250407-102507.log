Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 5, one 6, one 7, one 8, and one 9â€”no duplicates. As the first bid, it's safe to start with a conservative but reasonable bid. I'll choose 2 8s, since I have one 8 and it's likely the opponent has at least one as well.
