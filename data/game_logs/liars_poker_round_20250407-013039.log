Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand 80763417, I have one 0, one 1, one 3, two 4s, one 6, one 7, and one 8. The most frequent digits in my hand are two 4s. Statistically, starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 4s, as I already hold two myself, making the bid safe and plausible.
