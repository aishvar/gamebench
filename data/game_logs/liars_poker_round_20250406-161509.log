Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 52857471, I notice I have two 7s and two 5s, which are the highest counts of any digit in my hand. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I'll start with 2 7s, as I hold exactly two 7s, and it's likely there is at least one more among the opponent's 8 digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 23464620, I have zero 7s. The opponent bid '2 7s', claiming there are at least two 7s total. Since I have none, this means all claimed 7s would have to be in their hand. While possible, I can make a strategic bid based on what I do have. I see I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding '2 8s' would be a safe higher bid that advances both the quantity and digit, while being reasonably likely given the early stage of the game.

Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 5, 2, 8, 5, 7, 4, 7, 1. I have one 8. Since the current bid is 2 8s, this means my opponent likely has at least one 8 or is bluffing. Given that there are 16 digits total and the bid is relatively low, it's reasonable to assume there could be at least 3 of some digit. I don't have enough information to confidently challenge such a conservative bid. I will increase the quantity by one and select a digit I have multiple of, such as 7, which I have two of. So, I will bid 3 7s, which is a reasonable escalation based on my hand.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I can see my entire hand (23464620) and it contains no 7s. The opponent bid '3 7s', claiming there are at least 3 sevens total. Since I have zero 7s in my hand, this would mean the opponent needs to have at least 3 sevens in their hand of 8 digits. While possible, this seems unlikely enough to warrant a challenge, especially given their previous hesitation at '2 7s' before raising to '3 7s'.
