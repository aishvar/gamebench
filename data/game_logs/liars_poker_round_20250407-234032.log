Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a reasonable bid. Bidding 4 4s is a good starting point as it's plausible that the total number of 4s across both hands is at least four.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 4s in my hand. The opponent bid 4 4s, which would require all four 4s to be in their 8-card hand. The probability of an opponent holding exactly four 4s is relatively low (approximately 5.6% chance for exactly four 4s in 8 cards). Given the statistical improbability and my complete lack of 4s, challenging is strategically favorable here.
