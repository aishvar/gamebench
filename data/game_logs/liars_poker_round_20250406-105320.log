Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid. My hand is 74930141. I have two 1s and two 4s, which are my most frequent digits. The total number of digits in play is 16 (8 for me, 8 for the opponent). Statistically, the expected number of any digit across all 16 is 1.6. Since I have two 4s, the expected total number of 4s is 2 (my hand) + (8 * 0.1) = 2.8. Bidding '3 4s' is a reasonable opening bid based on my hand. It's slightly above the expected value but plausible, leverages my strongest digits, and starts the bidding at a decent level.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 2s, two 6s, two 8s, one 1, and one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s, and I don't have any 4s in my hand. Since the bid is already at 3, and I don't have any 4s, it's unlikely that there are 3 or more 4s in total (since the other player would need to have at least 3 4s in their hand). Therefore, challenging the bid seems like the best move.
