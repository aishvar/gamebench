Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. My hand is 36281277, which contains no 0s. I need to make a higher bid than 1 0s. The next possible bid can either be a higher quantity with the same digit or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I don't have any 0s, and there's a chance the other player might not have any either, bidding 1 1s seems reasonable as it increases the digit.
