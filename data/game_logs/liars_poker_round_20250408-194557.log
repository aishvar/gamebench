Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand, which guarantees at least two 2s in total. Since thereâ€™s no current bid, I can safely begin with a bid that I know is met by my own digits. This opening bid is modest and well-supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 2s in my hand (93670748). The opponent bid '2 2s', which means they're claiming there are at least 2 twos between both our hands. Since I have zero 2s, this means they would need to have at least 2 twos in their hand for their bid to be true. While possible, this seems unlikely as it would mean 25% of their hand is 2s. Given my hand has no 2s and the relatively low bid, I think challenging is the best move.
