--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand '39790748', I note the digit counts: two 9s, two 7s, one 3, one 0, one 4, and one 8. The most frequent digits in my hand are 7 and 9, each appearing twice. Opening with a conservative yet strong bid on a digit I have multiple of is strategic. Therefore, I will bid '2 9', indicating at least two 9s across both hands, which I already hold and is a safe opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 9s'. Since I do not have any 9s in my hand, I cannot be certain that the bid is invalid. However, the maximum possible number of 9s across both hands is 8 (if the other player has all 9s). Therefore, it is unlikely that there are 2 9s in total. Challenging the bid seems like a strategic move.
