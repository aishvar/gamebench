--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 8s. I have one 8 in my hand, and I know that Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free) made this bid. Given that I need to make a strictly higher bid, I should consider increasing either the quantity or the digit. Since I have an 8 in my hand and the bid is low, I can increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 2 8s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 8s. Since I can't make a higher bid without potentially lying, challenging is the safer option as it might reveal the bid as false if the total is less than 2.
