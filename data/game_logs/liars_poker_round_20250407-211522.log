Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 zero across both hands. Looking at my hand (79905843), I have zero zeros. Since Player 0 has bid 1 zero, there must be at least one zero in both hands combined for the bid to be valid. Given I have none, the entire count of zeros relies solely on Player 0's hand. The probability that Player 0 has at least one zero among their 8 digits is reasonably high (about 66%), so challenging now is risky. Instead, I should make a safe higher bid. Examining my hand, I have two '9's, so a safe bid is '2 9s'. This is a valid raise and forces Player 0 to respond.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 7, 9, 9, 0, 5, 8, 4, 3. This includes only 1 zero. The current bid is 3 zeros, which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 3 zeros total between both hands. Since I only have 1 zero, Player 0 must have at least 2 zeros for the bid to be valid. Given the naive 50/50 strategy and the typical distribution, having 2 or more zeros in Player 0's hand is plausible but not highly likely. The probability of Player 0 holding 2 or more zeros in 8 digits is roughly 33%, making the total of 3 zeros somewhat unlikely. Therefore, challenging is a reasonable move here rather than increasing the bid.
