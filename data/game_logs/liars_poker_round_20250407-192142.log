Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 zero. Looking at my hand (30646796), I have one zero myself. Since there are 16 digits in total and I already hold one zero, it's very plausible there is at least one zero overall, making the current bid valid. Bidding '2 0s' is risky because I don't know if the opponent has another zero. Instead, a safe way to increase the bid is to bid on a digit I have multiple of. In my hand, I have two 6s. So, I can confidently raise to '2 6s', which is a valid higher bid and backed by my hand. This pressures the opponent without overcommitting.
