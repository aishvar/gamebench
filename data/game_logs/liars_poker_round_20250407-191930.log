Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I can start the bidding with a valid bid. Given my hand (30743651), I have two '3's, one '0', one '4', one '6', one '5', and one '1'. I can confidently bid on '3' as I have two of them. A bid of '2 3' is reasonable and reflects the count of '3's in my hand. This will also set a foundation for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s, meaning there are claimed to be at least two 3s among the total 16 digits. Looking at my hand (9, 4, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 0), I have zero 3s. Since I hold half the digits and have none, Player 0 would need to have both 3s in their hand to make the bid valid. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely given the distribution of digits. However, it's not improbable enough to confidently challenge yet. Instead, I can safely raise the bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a minimal and strategic increase. The next valid minimal bid would be 2 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (30743651), I do not have any 4s. The last bid was '2 4s', which means Player 1 is claiming that there are at least 2 fours among both players' hands. Since I have no 4s, the maximum I can contribute is 0. Given that I cannot support the claim of 2 4s, I believe it is unlikely that Player 1 has 2 or more 4s. Therefore, I will challenge the last bid.
