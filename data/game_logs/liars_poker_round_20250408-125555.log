Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 97079425, which contains two 9s. Since there are 16 digits in total and I already have two 9s, bidding conservatively on a digit I have multiple of makes sense. Starting with a safe bid of 3 9s seems reasonable, as it's likely at least one additional 9 exists in my opponent's hand.
