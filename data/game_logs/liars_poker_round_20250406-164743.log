--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 9s, and one 7, 1, 6, and 4 each. A safe opening bid is typically 2 or 3 of a digit I hold multiple of. I will open with 2 9s since I have two 9s myself, making it very likely there are at least two in total.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is only 2 9s. Bidding 3 9s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 19759564, I have two 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, so for that bid to be valid, there must be at least one 9 in Player 1's hand. Since I hold two out of the maximum sixteen digits, it's plausible Player 1 has at least one 9, making the bid reasonable. Challenging now has a high risk of losing. Therefore, I will raise the bid. I could either increase the quantity to 4 9s or bid 3 of a higher digit. Looking at my hand, I also have two 5s, but only one 7, one 6, and one 4, so sticking with 9s is safer. I will bid 4 9s, increasing the quantity, which is the minimal valid raise.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, and I have one 9 in my hand. Since I have a digit that matches the current bid, I should make a higher bid. I can increase the quantity to 5 9s, as it's a valid and slightly higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s. The current bid is 5 9s, which would require at least three 9s in my opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. Given only 16 digits total, having five or more 9s is statistically unlikely, especially since I already hold two. The probability that my opponent holds three or more 9s is low, so challenging is the best strategic move.
