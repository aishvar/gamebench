Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand, making it a safe choice to bid on 2s. Starting with a lower quantity gives a higher chance of the bid being correct.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the probability of the current bid '2 2s' and decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge. Looking at my hand (11184706), I don't have any 2s. The opponent has claimed there are at least 2 twos between our hands. Since I have zero 2s, that means the opponent must have at least 2 twos in their hand for their bid to be valid. While this is certainly possible, I have no way to verify it. However, since this is the first bid and it's quite conservative (only claiming 2 of a digit), it's more strategic to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I can either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity but increase the digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, so bidding '3 1s' would be risky as I'd need the opponent to have at least one 1. Instead, I'll bid '2 4s' since I have a 4 in my hand, meaning I only need the opponent to have one more 4 for this to be valid, which is the same dependency as the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 4s. Since I can't make a higher bid without potentially lying, challenging is the safer option to test if the total meets the bid.
