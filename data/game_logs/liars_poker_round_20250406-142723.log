--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s and two 8s, which are my strongest digits. Statistically, with 32 digits in play, the average count per digit is about 3.2. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will bid 3 6s based on my two 6s and the likelihood that at least one other 6 exists among the other players.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Given that there are 8 secret digits per player and 4 players, the total possible count for any digit is 32. The bid seems low but not impossible. I should consider if I can reasonably increase the bid or challenge it. Since I have one 6 and there are 3 6s already bid, if I bid higher, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 4 6s seems risky without more information but increasing the digit seems reasonable.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 7s. Given that there are 32 digits in total, and assuming a uniform distribution, it's unlikely that there are 4 7s across all players. Therefore, challenging the bid seems like the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
