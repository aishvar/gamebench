Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 25473605. The current bid is '1 0s' by Player 0. I need to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. I hold one '0' in my hand. This means the total count of '0's across both hands is at least one. Therefore, the current bid of '1 0s' is guaranteed to be true, and I cannot challenge it. I must make a higher bid. A higher bid must either increase the quantity for the current digit ('2 0s') or increase the digit while keeping the quantity ('1 1s', '1 2s', etc.). My strategy is described as 'floor', suggesting a conservative approach, likely making the minimum safe bid possible based on my hand. I hold one '2'. Bidding '1 2s' is higher than '1 0s' and is guaranteed to be true because I possess a '2'. This is the lowest possible bid I can make that is higher than the current bid and is verifiably true from my own hand.
