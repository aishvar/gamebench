Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid, I need to make the first bid. My hand is 95374302. I see two 3s and one 9, but I'll start with a relatively conservative bid. I'll choose a digit that appears at least once and bid a quantity that's not too high. Bidding '2 3s' seems reasonable as it reflects the count of one of the digits in my hand and is a modest starting bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 3s', but I have no 3s in my hand. However, I do hold two 4s, so bidding '2 4s' is a safe minimal raise since it increases the bid by digit while being strongly supported by my hand. This bid is valid as it is strictly higher than '2 3s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 95374302, which contains two 3s and no 4s. The current bid is 2 4s. I need to make a higher bid than 2 4s. I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have two 3s, I know there are at least two 3s in total. Bidding 2 5s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit from 4 to 5 while keeping the quantity the same, and it's plausible given the distribution.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have only one 5 in my hand, so challenging would be risky. However, I hold two 8s, which makes bidding on 8s a safe play. By bidding 2 8s, I both overbid the current bid (since 8 is higher than 5) and leverage my strong holding, forcing my opponent to make a tougher decision.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 95374302, which contains one 8. So, in total, there are at least 2 8s (one from my hand and at least one from the other player's hand). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since 8 is the highest digit, I can only increase the quantity. Thus, the next possible bid is 3 8s. I will bid 3 8s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I hold two 8s, which means the current bid of 3 8s requires my opponent to have at least one 8. Given 8 unknown digits on the opponent’s side, the chance they have no 8 is about (0.9)^8 ≈ 43%, making the current bid only slightly more likely than not. Any bid I make would force a higher claim (for example, bidding 3 9s or 4 8s) that would rely entirely on my opponent having even more of that digit – a far less likely scenario given the probabilities. With my evidence strongly favoring a challenge (since I already have most of the claimed 8s and the increase in bid would be even riskier), I conclude that challenging is the best option.
