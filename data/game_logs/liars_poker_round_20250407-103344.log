Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, it's very likely there is at least one more zero in Player 0's hand, or at minimum, the current bid is valid. Therefore, challenging now is unwise. The minimal higher bid is 1 1s, but I also have one 7, one 6, one 3, one 8, one 5, and one 4, so I can safely increase the digit to 1 8s to raise the stakes modestly without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 7, 0, 7, 6, 3, 8, 5, 4. I do not have any 9s, so the current bid of 1 9s relies entirely on Player 0's hand. Since it's quite plausible they have at least one 9, challenging now is risky. To safely increase the bid, I can consider digits I have multiple of. I have two 7s and one 0 and one 8. Since I have two 7s, a reasonable next bid is 2 7s, which is strictly higher than 1 9s (higher quantity). This bid leverages my hand's strength and pressures the opponent.
