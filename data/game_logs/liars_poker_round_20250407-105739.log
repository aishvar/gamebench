Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 2, two 4s, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 9. A safe and standard opening bid is 2 of a common mid-value digit. I have two 4s, so bidding 2 4s is reasonable and conservative.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 41592769, I have one 5 and one 4. The current bid is 2 5s, which seems plausible given I hold one 5 and the opponent might have one or more. Since the bid is low and safe, challenging now is premature. A natural next bid is to increase the quantity to 3 on a digit I have some presence in. I have two 9s, making a bid of 3 9s reasonable as I personally hold two and only need one more across both hands to satisfy the bid.
