Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, and I can confidently say that there are at least 3 8s total because I have one and I suspect Player 0 might have at least one as well. Therefore, I will bid 3 8s to make a valid higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 4 8s is a safe increase. I don't have enough information to confidently challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand (from the digits 15403912). The current bid is 4 8s, and since I have sufficient digits to support a higher bid, I can confidently bid 5 8s, which is a valid higher bid based on the current quantity and digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 6 8s is a safe increase, and it's likely to be valid given the bidding history. The previous bids have been incrementally increasing the quantity of 8s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 8S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s, two 3s, and one 0 in my hand, but no 8s. The current bid is 6 8s, which seems very high given that I have no 8s and there are only 16 digits total. It's unlikely that there are 6 8s in both hands combined. Therefore, I should challenge the last bid.
