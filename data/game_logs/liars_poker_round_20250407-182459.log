Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there hasn't been any bid yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 4s, two 8s, one 2, one 6, and one 0. A good opening bid is typically on a digit I hold multiple times, to increase the likelihood the total count is higher. I have two 4s, so bidding 2 4s is safe and reasonable as an opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. It's possible there are two more 4s in the other player's hand, making the bid valid. However, it's also possible they are bluffing. To play it safe and increase the bid, I will bid 3 4s. This is a slightly aggressive move, but it puts pressure on the other player.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. Looking at my hand (54258460), I have two 4s. To reach 3 total 4s, the opponent would need at least one 4, which is quite likely given their 8 digits. So 3 4s is a plausible bid and not worth challenging. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity to 4 4s, which would require the opponent to have at least two 4s (since I only have two), or I can bid 3 5s. I have two 5s in my hand, so a bid of 3 5s would require the opponent to have at least one 5, which is reasonable. Since 3 5s is a valid next bid and safer than jumping to 4 4s, I will bid 3 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have zero 5s in my hand. The previous bids were 2 4s and 3 4s. It's possible that Player 0 is bluffing. To make a valid bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. I could bid 3 6s, 3 7s, 3 8s, 3 9s, 4 0s, 4 1s, 4 2s, 4 3s, 4 4s, 4 5s, etc. I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding 3 8s is a safer option than bidding 3 6s or 3 7s. However, I think there's a reasonable chance that the current bid of 3 5s is a bluff, so I will challenge.
