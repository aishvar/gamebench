Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Starting with the highest digit I hold (8) to establish a strong bid early. Bidding 2 of 8 allows for a plausible lie (I have 1, opponent might have 0 or 1), making it challenging to call immediately. The high digit (8) also gives later bids room to escalate in quantity while maintaining strategic advantage.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. Looking at my hand (26915523), I have zero 8s. Since I don't hold any 8s, the entire count of 8s depends solely on Player 0's hand. For the bid of 2 8s to be valid, Player 0 must have at least two 8s, which is somewhat unlikely given typical digit distributions. Therefore, challenging is a reasonable strategy here as the bid seems risky.
