Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game, and I need to establish a starting point. My hand (49038989) contains three 9s and three 8s, which are the most frequent digits. It's generally advantageous to start bidding on a digit I hold many of. Between 8s and 9s, bidding on the higher digit (9s) is slightly more strategic as it forces the opponent to increase the quantity if they want to bid on a lower digit. I hold three 9s. Bidding '4 9s' is a reasonable opening bid, as it leverages my strong hand in 9s and posits the existence of at least one more 9 in the opponent's hand (which is statistically likely with 8 unknown digits). This bid is informative but not overly aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 nines. Since I have the digits 5, 1, 3, 7, 0, 0, 3, and 2, I do not have any nines in my hand. Considering that there are only 16 total digits across both players' hands, it is unlikely that there are four nines in total. Therefore, I believe the bid made by Player 0 is too high and I will challenge it.
