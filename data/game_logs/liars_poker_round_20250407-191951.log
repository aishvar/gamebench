Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player, I need to make an initial bid. My hand contains two 0s, three 2s, and one each of 1, 3, 4, and 5. Bidding on a digit with a higher count in my hand increases the likelihood of a valid bid. I choose to bid on the digit 2 with a quantity of 4, as it balances the risk of challenging and provides room for future bids.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 twos. Looking at my hand (51473566), I have zero 2s. Since I hold no 2s, for the bid of 4 twos to be valid, the opponent must have all 4 or more 2s in their hand of 8 digits. This is unlikely, as having 4 or more of a single digit in 8 is rare. Therefore, I suspect the opponent is bluffing or overestimating. Given the unlikelihood of 4 or more total 2s, the best move is to challenge.
