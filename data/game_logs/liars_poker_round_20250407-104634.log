Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s relies entirely on Player 0 having at least one 0, which is plausible. Since the minimum bid is very low and I cannot challenge such a conservative bid effectively, I should raise. My hand contains two 5s, so bidding 2 5s is a safe and natural higher bid, increasing both the quantity and switching to a digit I hold multiple times.
