--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 07204212, the digit '2' appears three times, and '0' appears twice. A safe initial bid is to pick a digit for which I have a strong count. '2' seems best with 3 in my hand, so a conservative but solid opening bid is 3 twos, which is likely to be true or even conservative given the total of 16 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. The maximum possible number of 2s across both hands is 8, which is less than the current bid. Therefore, it is likely that the opponent is bluffing.
