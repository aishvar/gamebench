Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 5s, one 1, one 8, one 4, and one 1. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will choose 2 5s, reflecting that I have two 5s myself, and it's likely there could be at least two overall.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 6s, so the current bid of 2 6s implies both are likely in the opponent's hand, which is plausible. To continue safely, I can increase the bid to 2 7s, which is the minimal valid higher bid and keeps pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. The current bid is 2 8s, so for that bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least one 8. This is plausible. Bidding 2 9s would be a minimal raise but risky without any 9s in my hand. Alternatively, I have two 5s, so a confident and safe raise is to bid 3 5s, increasing the quantity and reverting to a digit I hold strongly. This bid is likely valid given my hand, and it pressures the opponent.
