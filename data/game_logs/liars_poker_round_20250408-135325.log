Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I should start conservatively. I have two 8s in my hand, which gives me confidence that there might be at least one more 8 in my opponent's hand. A safe opening bid is thus '3 8s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '26295304', I have zero 8s. Since there are 16 digits total, and given I have none, the opponent would need to have all 3 or more 8s in their hand for the bid of 3 8s to be valid. The probability of the opponent having 3 or more 8s is quite low. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
