--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I don't have any 4s in my hand. The maximum number of 4s possible is 16. Bidding higher seems risky without knowing the opponent's hand or the distribution of digits. I will challenge the bid.
