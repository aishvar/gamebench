Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 5s, and one each of 1, 2, 3, and 9. Opening with a conservative yet reasonable bid based on my duplicates makes sense. I'll start with '2 5s' as I hold two 5s, which is a safe opening bid.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have one 5 in my hand (81918853), so the total count of 5s is at least 1. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have an 8, which is higher than 5, and there's a possibility that the other player might not have a high count of 8s, I can consider bidding on 8s. However, I should start with a conservative bid. Bidding 2 8s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '25903105', I have zero 8s. Given that, for Player 1's bid of 2 8s to be valid, they must have at least two 8s themselves, which is possible but not guaranteed. Since 2 is a conservative bid and zero 8s on my side does not make the bid implausible, challenging now is risky. Instead, I will raise conservatively to 3 of a digit I have multiple of. I have two 0s and two 5s. Bidding 3 5s is a safe incremental raise, increasing the quantity while leveraging my own hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have information about the other player's hand, I'll consider my hand and the bid history. I have one 8, which is higher than 5, and the previous bid was 2 8s. It's possible that there's at least one more 8. I can bid 3 8s, maintaining the same quantity but increasing the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 25903105, I have zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, so for it to be valid, my opponent would need at least 3 8s in their hand. Given there are only 8 digits per player, it's unlikely they have 3 or more 8s alone, especially since I have none. Statistically, 3 of a particular digit across 16 total digits is possible but not very likely when I hold none. Since I can't confidently raise the bid on 8s or another digit, the best move is to challenge.
