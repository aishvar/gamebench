Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to start the bidding. I have two 7s in my hand, so I will bid 2 7s. This is a reasonable starting point that reflects my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, which makes it less likely that there are at least two 7s across both hands. However, it is still plausible, given the total of 16 digits in play. To avoid challenging too early and potentially losing, I will make a higher bid. I have two 4s in my hand, so bidding 3 4s seems like a reasonable step up from the current bid of 2 7s.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 4s. Since I have a strong hand with higher digits, I can bid 4 7s, which is a valid higher bid both in quantity and digit compared to the current bid.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s, and I have only one 7 in my hand. This means there need to be at least three more 7s in Player 0's hand to meet the bid. While this is possible, it is not guaranteed. However, to avoid risking an early challenge, I can make a higher bid. I have two 4s in my hand, so bidding 4 4s is a reasonable strategic move. It keeps the quantity the same but shifts the focus to a digit I have more of, allowing me to maintain control of the game.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7. The current bid is 4 7s, which would require at least three more 7s in Player 0's hand to meet the bid. This seems plausible but not guaranteed. To avoid challenging prematurely and since I can make a higher bid, I will bid 4 8s, increasing the digit while maintaining the same quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 7s and one 2, but no 8s in my hand. Since the maximum possible total count of 8s is uncertain, I should increase the bid quantity or change the digit. I can bid 5 8s, which is a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s, and I have only one 8 in my hand. This means there would need to be at least four more 8s in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution of numbers and the fact that 8 is a specific digit, it seems unlikely that Player 0 has four 8s. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
