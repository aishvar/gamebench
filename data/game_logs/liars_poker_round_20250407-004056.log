Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains two 7s and two 6s, among other digits. A reasonable starting bid could be 2 7s or 2 6s, given that I have multiple instances of these digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 7s. Since I only have one 7, I cannot confidently bid higher without risking a challenge. However, I can try to increase the quantity to 3 7s, assuming there might be another 7 in the opponent's hand. This is a reasonable increment, as it increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 7s in my hand, and I know that Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bid 3 7s. Given that I have two 7s and the opponent has at least 3 7s, I should consider the possibility that they have more than 3 7s in total. However, I also have to consider that my bid must be strictly higher than the current bid. Since I have two 7s and the current bid is 3 7s, I could increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity seems risky without knowing the opponent's hand, but I could try to increase the digit. I have a 8 and a 9 in my hand, so bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and matches the quantity.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 8s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and I only have one 8, it's unlikely there are three 8s in total. Challenging seems like the best move.
