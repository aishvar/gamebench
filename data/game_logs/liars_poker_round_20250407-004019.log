Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 4s, and two 8s. Bidding 2 8s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit and I have a pair, making it a safe starting bid.

Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my hand is 17285876, I have a total of 3 eights and one other 8. Given that there are only two players and 16 digits in total, bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as I have one 8 in my hand and the other player may have at most two 8s, making my bid possible but not certain. However, bidding a higher digit with a reasonable quantity seems strategic. I have a 9 in my hand, so bidding 2 9s seems like a good strategy as it's higher than 8 and I only need to ensure the quantity is believable.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which means there must be at least one more 8 in the other player's hand. Given the current bid and my hand, bidding 4 8s is not possible without risking a challenge. However, I can increase the quantity and digit by bidding 4 9s, as I have one 9 in my hand, making it a reasonable and higher bid.

Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more likely to succeed. My hand contains the digits 1, 7, 2, 8, 5, 8, 7, 6. I have two 8s and two 7s, but no 9s. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and with 8 secret digits in my hand and 8 in Player 0's, there are 16 digits in total. The current bid of 4 9s seems high but I have no 9s. I should bid higher than 4 if possible or challenge if I think it's unlikely. Since I have two 8s and the last bid was 4 9s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I have no 9s, so bidding higher on 9s isn't wise. However, I can try to bid on a digit I have. My bid of 5 8s seems reasonable as I have two 8s and it's higher than 4 9s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand, and the maximum possible 8s in play is 2 (from my hand) + 2 (from the opponent's hand) = 4. Since the current bid of 5 8s exceeds the maximum possible, it's highly unlikely to be true. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
