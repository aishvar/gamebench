Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid and there is no prior bid to challenge, I need to make an opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 6s, one 0, one 5, one 8, and one 9. The most common digits in my hand are 1 and 6 with two occurrences each. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 6s, as I already hold two myself, making it likely that there could be more across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 96085116, I have no 7s, so the current bid of 2 7s relies entirely on my opponent having at least two 7s, which is unlikely with only 8 digits. However, since 2 7s is a modest bid, challenging now is risky. I have two 1s and two 6s, so I can safely increase the bid on either of those digits. The best move is to increase the quantity to 3, leveraging my count of 1s, bidding 3 1s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (96085116), I have two 1s, one 2, and one 6. The current bid is 3 2s, and since I only have one 2, the opponent would need to have at least two 2s to make the bid valid. This is somewhat unlikely but possible. However, I have two 1s, so bidding 3 6s or 3 7s wouldn't be stronger, but increasing the quantity to 4 with a digit I have good representation of is safer. I can bid 4 1s based on my two 1s, expecting the opponent might have at least two more 1s, which is plausible.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (96085116), I have zero 2s, so all four 2s would have to be in the opponent's hand. Given that the opponent has only 8 digits, it's statistically unlikely they have 4 of a single digit, especially since I have none. The probability of 4 or more 2s in their hand is quite low, making the current bid of 4 2s improbable. Therefore, the optimal move is to challenge.
