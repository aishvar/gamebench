Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 69242300, I have zero 1s. The opponent bid '3 1s', claiming there are at least 3 ones total. Since I have none, this means all 3 ones would need to be in their hand. While possible, this seems unlikely as it would mean over 1/3 of their digits are 1s. Given I have no 1s to support their claim, I should challenge.
