Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 1 and no 0s in my hand (42561715). The total count of 0s across both hands must be at least 1 (the one potentially held by Player 0). Bidding 1 1s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, making it a valid and potentially strategic move.
