Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 31447691, I have zero 8s. Since I hold half of all digits and none are 8s, the entire bid relies on my opponent having at least 3 of the 8s in their hand of 8 digits. The probability of that is quite low, as the expected number of 8s per player is around 1.6 (16 digits / 10 digits). Given this low likelihood, challenging the bid is the most strategic move.
