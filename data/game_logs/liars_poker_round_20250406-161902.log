--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 1s, one 3, two 6s, and one 4 and 8. Bidding on the digit with the highest count in my hand (1 or 6) seems reasonable. I'll start with 2 1s, as it's a safe initial bid.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 0, 4, 5, 9, 7, 2, 8, 2. I don't have any 1s, so the current bid of 2 1s relies entirely on my opponent having at least two 1s, which is plausible. Since I cannot confidently challenge yet, the safe move is to increase the bid. I have two 2s, so bidding 3 2s is a reasonable and safe next bid, as it is likely there is at least one more 2 in my opponent's hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 2S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one '2' in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s, which means there needs to be at least two more '2's in the opponent's hand (since I only have one). The probability of the opponent having exactly two '2's is not extremely high, but it's possible. To play it safe, I will make a higher bid based on the digits in my hand. I have three '1's and three '6's. Bidding 4 1s is a reasonable increase from the current bid of 3 2s, leveraging the strength of my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 0, 4, 5, 9, 7, 2, 8, 2. I have zero 1s, so the current bid of 4 1s relies entirely on Player 0 holding at least 4 1s, which is unlikely given the distribution. Since there are only 16 digits total, and I have none, it's improbable that there are 4 or more 1s in total. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
