Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand, so I am certain that there are at least three 3s in total. Since there is no current bid, I can start with a bid that is safely backed by my own hand. Thus, bidding '3 3s' is a solid opening move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I don't have any 3s in my hand. I can raise the bid to 4 0s. This is a safe raise, and I don't have enough information to confidently challenge.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I only have one 0 in my hand (from 31038439), so for the bid of 4 0s to be valid the opponent would need to have at least three 0s among their 8 digitsâ€”a statistically very unlikely scenario. Rather than risk a bid based on weak evidence, I will challenge the current bid.
