Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make a valid higher bid. Since the current bid is None, I can start by bidding on any digit I have in my hand. I have two 6s in my hand, but since the current bid is None, I should bid on a digit that is likely to be high, considering the random nature of the other player's hand. I will bid on the digit 6, as it is present in my hand and has a good chance of being high.
