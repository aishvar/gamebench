Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 8s, one 2, one 5, one 7, and one 0. The most frequent digits in my hand are 3s and 8s, each appearing twice. Starting with a conservative bid based on my own hand, I will bid 2 8s, as I already have two, making it a safe opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have the digits 42192609, and I can see that I have one 8 (from the digit 9 and 8 are not present but there's no 8, so count is 0) and no 8s in my hand. The total count of 8s across both hands must be at least the count in Player 0's hand. It's possible Player 0 has two 8s. Bidding higher than 2 8s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. I can bid 2 9s, which is a valid higher bid because 9 is higher than 8. Alternatively, I can bid 3 0s or any other 3 [digit]s. Given my hand, I see I have a 2 and a 9, so bidding 3 9s seems plausible if I consider that Player 0 might have at least one 9. However, a more conservative and safer bid is to increase the digit. Thus, bidding 2 9s is a reasonable action.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 32388570, I have two 8s and no 9s. Since the current bid is 2 9s, and I hold zero 9s, for that bid to be correct, the opponent must have at least two 9s in their hand of eight digits. The probability of that is relatively low. Additionally, since I have two 8s, I can safely increase the bid to 3 8s, which is a strictly higher bid (higher quantity, lower digit). This puts pressure on my opponent and leverages my strong count of 8s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have the digits 42192609, and I can see that I have one 9 and no 8s. The bid history shows that Player 0 initially bid 2 8s and then increased it to 3 8s after my bid of 2 9s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have one 9, I can confidently bid on a higher digit or increase the quantity. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable move as it keeps the same quantity but increases the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 3, 2, 3, 8, 8, 5, 7, 0. I have zero 9s. Since I possess no 9s, the opponent would need at least 3 9s alone to make their bid valid, which is unlikely with only 8 digits. Given typical distribution and no 9s on my side, it's improbable that there are 3 or more 9s in total. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
