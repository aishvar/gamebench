Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two 5s in my hand, I can start with a conservative bid to test the waters. Bidding 2 5s is based on my hand and leaves room for the opponent to respond.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 5s. Bidding 2 6s is a valid higher bid since 6 is a higher digit than 5. This move leverages my hand strength while maintaining a plausible bid.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s. Since I only have one, it's possible the other player has at least one more 6, making the bid valid. However, bidding higher would require increasing the quantity or digit. Given my hand has digits up to 8, I can bid 2 7s to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 7S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 7s in my hand, so the current bid of 2 7s must come entirely from Player 0. Given the bid history and the low quantity, challenging is a reasonable move as it's uncertain if Player 0 actually holds two 7s.
