--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 98024611, I have two 1s, one 0, one 2, one 4, one 6, one 8, and one 9. A safe opening is to bid on a digit I have multiple of, which is '2 1s'. This is a conservative but reasonable opening bid that reflects my hand and leaves room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 2 1s and looking at my hand, 38777529, I notice I don't have any 1s. However, I have multiple 7s. Since my goal is to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current one, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Bidding on the same digit with a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit are my options. Considering I have three 7s, which is a higher digit than 1, I can make a reasonable bid based on my hand without necessarily needing to challenge the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 98024611, I have two 1s and no 7s. Since I have zero 7s, for the total count of 7s to be at least 3, the opponent would need to have all three or more, which is statistically unlikely. Given there are only 16 digits total and I hold none of the target digit, challenging is the best move.
