Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 5, one 4, one 3, two 0s, one 2, and one 1. Since there's no current bid, I can make any opening bid. Starting with a moderate bid based on what I know I have is a good strategy. I have two 0s in my hand, so bidding '3 0s' is reasonable as there's a good chance the opponent has at least one more 0 in their hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze what I know and make a strategic decision. In my hand (31594606), I have one 0, which means there are at least that many in the game. The opponent has bid '3 0s', claiming there are at least 3 zeros total between both our hands. Since I only have 1 zero, this means they must have at least 2 zeros in their hand for their bid to be true. This is certainly possible, but not guaranteed. I could challenge, but it's a relatively low and reasonable opening bid, so the risk is high. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, which gives me confidence to bid on 6s. I'll bid '3 6s', keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value, which constitutes a valid higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 30542031, I have no 6s. The opponent bid '3 6s' after my '3 0s' bid. Given I have no 6s, for their bid to be true, they would need at least 3 6s in their hand of 8 digits. While possible, having 3 or more of the same digit in 8 random digits is relatively unlikely. Since I have zero 6s, and they would need all 3 claimed 6s in their hand, challenging seems like the better option than raising to a higher bid.
