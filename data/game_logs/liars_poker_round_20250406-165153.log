--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have one of each digit from 1 to 8. A conservative and safe opening bid is '2 1s' because it's likely that among both hands there are at least two 1s, and it sets a low starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 2 1s. Bidding 2 7s is a valid higher bid because 7 is a higher digit than 1 at the same quantity. This move leverages my strong hand in 7s and maintains safety since even if the opponent has no 7s, the total count would still be exactly 2 (from my hand), meeting the bid requirement.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 16457238, I have one 7. The current bid is 2 7s, which is plausible since I have one and it's reasonable to assume the opponent might have at least one 7 as well. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since I don't have any 8s or 9s, increasing the digit would be riskier. Instead, bidding 3 7s is a safe incremental increase, as it's quite likely that across 16 digits there are at least 3 sevens.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s and two 1s in my hand. The opponent initially bid 2 1s, suggesting they likely hold at least two 1s. Combined with my two 1s, the total would be at least four, making a bid of 4 1s valid. This bid safely increases the quantity while leveraging the opponent's initial 1s bid, reducing the risk of being challenged successfully.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (1 6 4 5 7 2 3 8), I have only one '1'. The current bid is 4 1s, which requires there to be at least 3 more '1's in Player 1's hand. Since each player has 8 digits, it's unlikely Player 1 has 3 or more '1's, as that would mean nearly half of their hand consists of '1's. Given this improbability, challenging the bid is the best strategic move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 1's (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bid of 4 1s.
