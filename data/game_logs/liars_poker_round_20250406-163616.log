Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 65412981, I have one of each digit except 3 and 7. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 of a digit I possess. I have two 1s, so bidding 2 1s is a solid opening bid based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 1s in my hand, so I cannot directly support the current bid of 2 1s. However, given that there are 16 digits in total, it is plausible that Player 0 has at least 2 1s. To stay in the game, I need to make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, which is a strong basis for bidding on 6s. A bid of 3 6s increases the quantity while shifting to a digit I can support, making it a reasonable choice.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 65412981, I have one 6. The current bid is 3 6s. Since I only have one 6, for the bid to be valid, my opponent must have at least two 6s, which is possible but not guaranteed. The total number of 6s across both hands being three is plausible, so challenging now may be premature. To make a higher bid, I can increase the digit while keeping quantity the same, such as 3 7s, or increase quantity to 4 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, which suggests a bid of 4 1s could be reasonable, as I already hold half of that count, making it more likely overall.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand, and the current bid is 4 1s. Given that there are 16 total digits in play, it is plausible that Player 0 has multiple 1s in their hand. However, bidding higher is a safer move at this stage. I also have two 6s in my hand, making a bid of 4 6s a reasonable option since it increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 65412981, I have two 6s. The current bid is 4 6s, which requires there to be at least four 6s across both hands. Since I hold two, the opponent would need at least two more 6s. That is plausible, but any higher bid on 6s becomes increasingly unlikely. Instead of raising the quantity, I could bid 4 7s, 4 8s, or 4 9s to increase the digit while maintaining the quantity. I have one 8, so bidding 4 8s seems slightly safer than 4 7s or 4 9s, as it leverages my known digit. Therefore, I will raise to 4 8s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. In my hand, I have one 8. This means there need to be at least three more 8s in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. While it is possible, it is not guaranteed. However, I can make a safer bid by increasing the digit to 9, as I have two 9s in my hand, making it more likely that a higher count of 9s exists across both hands. Therefore, I will bid 4 9s to keep the game going and avoid challenging prematurely.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 65412981, I have one 9. The current bid is 4 9s, which means there would need to be at least three 9s in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. This is quite unlikely given that the average number of any digit across 16 digits is about 1.6, and having 4 or more of a specific digit is relatively rare. Since I only have one 9, the probability that there are at least 4 total is low. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
