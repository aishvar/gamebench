Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I hold three 9s in my hand, guaranteeing that there are at least three 9s in play. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, raising to 3 9s is a strictly higher bid that leverages my strong holding and minimizes risk.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, so for the total count of 0s to be at least 4, the opponent would need to have at least 3 zeros. Given that each digit is random, there's only about a 3.8% chance of the opponent having 3 or more zeros in their 8 cards. This makes the current bid of '4 0s' highly unlikely to be true, so challenging is the best move.
