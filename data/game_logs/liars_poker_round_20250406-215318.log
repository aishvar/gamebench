Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make a valid starting bid. I have a total of 8 digits, including 4 unique digits. A reasonable opening bid could be 2 1s, as I have one '1' in my hand. This bid is low enough to be plausible while still being a valid move.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand, which means there are at least 4 1s in total when considering my hand and the possibility of Player 1 having more. The current bid is 3 1s, so I can make a higher bid. I will bid 4 1s, which is a valid move since it increases the quantity.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. I could raise the bid to 5 1s, or bid 4 of a higher number. Given that I have two 8s, bidding 4 8s seems like a reasonable move.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 8s. Given that there are only 16 total digits, it seems unlikely that there are 4 8s. I should challenge the last bid.
