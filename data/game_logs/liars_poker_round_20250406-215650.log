Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to make a valid first bid. I have two 4s in my hand, which suggests that I can confidently bid at least 2 4s. However, to make a more compelling bid, I can bid 3 4s, which is a reasonable increase in quantity while still being based on my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. I could bid 3 5s, matching the quantity but increasing the digit. However, I have two 5s in my hand. Therefore, bidding 4 5s seems like a slightly better option, increasing both quantity and matching a digit I have.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s and one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s, which seems quite high given that I only have a couple of 4s. I can bid 5 4s to increase the quantity while staying within a reasonable digit based on my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s and two 0s in my hand. Since the current bid is 6 5s, I can bid 7 4s, which is a valid higher bid by increasing the quantity while using a digit I have in my hand. This seems reasonable given my hand.
