Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. I have 8 digits: 1, 8, 6, 2, 6, 2, 7, 8. Counting the frequency of each digit, I have one 1, two 2s, two 6s, one 7, and two 8s. The digits 2, 6, and 8 appear most frequently (twice each). A safe opening bid is usually based on the digits you hold. Bidding '2 8s' is a reasonable start, as I possess two 8s myself, and it's statistically plausible there are at least two 8s in total across both hands (16 digits total). Choosing 8s, a high digit, forces the opponent to either bid a higher quantity or bid 2 9s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, and the current bid is already 2 8s. Given there are only 16 digits total, it seems unlikely that there are 2 8s in play. I will challenge the bid.
