Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s, two 8s, and one 9 in my hand. Since there are no previous bids, I can start the bidding. I will bid 2 7s, as I have enough to support this bid and it sets a reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand and increasing the total count to 3 is a legal and potentially safer bid because I need only one additional 6 from the opponentâ€™s 8-digit hand. With the current bid at 2 7s, bidding '3 6s' raises the quantity while relying on my own strong hold on 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s and one 9, which means I have a total of three digits that are higher than the current bid of 3 6s. Since I can bid higher, I'll bid 4 7s, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Player 0 bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I only have one 7 in my hand and the current bid of 4 7s requires the opponent to have at least 3 additional 7s among their 8 digits. Statistically, the chance of the opponent having 3 or more 7s is extremely low (around 4%), making the bid very unlikely to be true. Thus, I should challenge the bid.
