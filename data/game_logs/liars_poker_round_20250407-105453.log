Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without fear of being challenged. I see I have two 0s, which is a good starting point. The bid should be higher than 0, and having two 0s, I can start with a low but valid bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have two 0s in my hand, so I can confidently increase the quantity to 3 0s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. Given that the bid is only 3, and I have two 0s, it's reasonable to increase the quantity since I have a direct interest in 0s and it seems likely that Player 1 might not have many 0s. I will bid 4 0s to increase the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. Given my hand contains 2 3s, I can safely bid on the digit 3. Bidding 4 3s seems reasonable, considering the current bid is on the digit 0.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains 3 sixes, 2 fives, 1 zero, 1 three, 1 nine. I should consider bidding on a digit that I have in my hand and increasing the quantity. Since I have three 6s and the current bid is 4 3s, I can increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 5 6s seems reasonable as it's higher than 4 3s and I have multiple 6s in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have 2 6s in my hand. Given the current bid's quantity, I should aim to bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. I notice that the digit 6 is already bid, but I can try to increase the quantity. I also have a 3 in my hand, which could be a potential higher digit. However, I don't want to bid 3 6s, as it would be the same digit as the current bid, so I'll bid a higher quantity with a different digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 3S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. Given that I have two 3s and two 6s in my hand, and considering the bid history, I should assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since the bid is 6 3s, I need to consider if I can reasonably make a higher bid. I have a 6 and several other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. However, bidding 7 or more seems risky without knowing the exact distribution of digits among the players. I will increase the quantity and keep the digit high but not the highest, considering my hand and the previous bids.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s, but I have two 6s in my hand. I should increase both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 8 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, and the bid history shows increasing quantities but not necessarily digits. Given that the last bid was 8 6s and I have two 6s, I should consider if I can reasonably make a higher bid or challenge. Since I have two 6s and the bid is already at 8 6s, I should think about if there's a possibility that there are more than 8 6s in total or if I can make a valid higher bid. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and there are 16 digits in total between both players. I also have a 6 in my hand, which makes 3 6s in total if I include my own. A bid of 9 6s seems unlikely but possible if the other player has many 6s. However, I can also consider bidding on a different digit or challenging. Given my hand (95501106), I have 3 0s, which could be a safer bet since 8 0s seems more plausible than 9 6s given the distribution.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 9 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 0s. I have no 0s in my hand, but I have several high digits. I should bid a higher quantity or digit to increase my chances of winning.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 5S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 10 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 5s. I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or challenge. My hand contains 3 5s and other digits, but no 5s are in my hand. I have a total of 8 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. Given that the current bid is 10 5s and I do not have any 5s, I should consider if there's a high digit in my hand that could make a reasonable bid or if challenging is the best option.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 11 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 11 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 11 6s. I have 2 6s in my hand. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 11 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Considering the bid history, which has seen a steady increase in the quantity of digits, I should slightly exceed the current bid to assert my presence in the game.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 12 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 12 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 12 6s. Given that I have two 6s in my hand and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I need to assess if this bid is likely or not. Since there are 16 digits in total and the opponent has already bid higher quantities for other digits, I should consider if my hand can support a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent.
