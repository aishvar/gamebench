Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 8s. Since I can validate that at least 2 8s could exist with my hand, I can raise the bid. I will bid 3 8s, which is a valid higher bid than the current one.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3

Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 8s in my hand, which means there are at least 6 8s across both hands if I include my own. To make a valid higher bid, I can bid 5 8s. This is a reasonable move since I already have two 8s and it increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. It's possible there are at least five 8s in total, but it's also possible my opponent is bluffing. Since the bid history shows a steady increase in 8s, and I only have two, I will bid slightly higher to test my opponent. I will bid 6 8s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 8S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s, and I have two 8s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I could bid 7 8s, but that would require at least one more 8 from my opponent. Since I know I have 2 8s and the total possible is 16, I can bid 7 9s, which increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a reasonable bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 9S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 7 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. It's possible there are at least 7 nines in total, but it's also possible Player 1 is bluffing. Since the bid is already quite high, and I only have one 9, I will challenge.
