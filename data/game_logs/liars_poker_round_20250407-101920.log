Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) making initial bid: 1 0s

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, but I do have two 5s and two 8s. The current bid is only 1 0s, which is very low. Statistically, there are likely multiple copies of common digits like 5 or 8 across both hands. An easy and safe higher bid is 1 1s, but I can confidently increase the bid to 2 5s since I already hold two 5s myself, making it very likely to be true.

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 2 6s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which already accounts for the entire current bid of 2 6s. Since it's likely there could be at least one more 6 in Player 0's hand, a conservative but valid next bid would be 3 6s, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 7s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 6, 5, 6, 8, 9, 4, 5, 8. Counting 7s, I have zero. The current bid is 3 7s, implying there are at least three 7s across both hands. Since I have none, all three (or more) would have to be in Player 0's hand. The probability of Player 0 having three or more 7s in their eight digits is quite low. Statistically, the expected number of 7s in their hand is less than one. Therefore, it's unlikely their bid is valid, and challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (Naive 50/50) bid of 3 7s.
