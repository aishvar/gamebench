Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I need to start the bidding. In my hand, I have two 0s, two 4s, and one of each of the other digits. I will bid 3 4s because I have two 4s in my hand, and it's reasonable to assume at least one more 4 exists in the other player's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 5, 1, 9, 2, 8, 8, 3, 3. I have two 8s and two 3s, and one 5, one 9, one 1, and one 2, and one 6 is not present but a higher digit than 4 could be considered. Since I have two 8s and two 3s, and no 4s or 6s or 7s or higher quantity of lower digits, I should bid something that seems reasonable given my hand and the goal to make a higher bid. I see that bidding 4 5s could be reasonable given that I have one 5 and it's higher than 4 and also higher than 3.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, which makes it less likely that there are at least 4 5s across all 16 digits. The current bid of 4 5s seems risky to me, as it assumes a significant presence of 5s in my opponent's hand. I will challenge this bid to test its validity.
