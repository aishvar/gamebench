Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand (78293760), I observe the digit counts: 7(2), 8(1), 2(1), 9(2), 3(1), 6(1), 0(1). The most frequent digit in my hand is 7 and 9, each appearing twice. Statistically, starting with a conservative but solid bid on one of these digits is reasonable. I'll choose 2 sevens as my opening bid, which is supported by my hand alone and puts early pressure on my opponent.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. It's plausible that there are at least two 7s in total across both hands. I could bid higher, but I don't want to overcommit. I will challenge because it's early in the game and the bid seems a bit aggressive.
