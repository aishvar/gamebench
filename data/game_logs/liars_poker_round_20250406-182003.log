Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. The probability of having at least one 0 is relatively low since there are 8 digits and 10 possible values (0-9). It's reasonable to bid higher. I can bid 2 0s, increasing the quantity. This is a conservative move, as it is still a low quantity.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I can see my own hand, which is 47317845. This hand contains one 1. So, the total count of 1s across both hands is at least one (mine) plus some unknown number from the other player's hand. The current bid of 2 1s is possible but not certain. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 7s and no other high digits, bidding 3 7s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases both the quantity and the digit.
