--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 3 different digits in my hand (1, 2, 9) but no repeated digits. The current bid is None, so I should make a bid with a quantity of 1 and a digit that is likely to be in my hand. I'll choose the digit 1, which has a relatively high probability of occurrence.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 1 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand, and the current bid is 1 1s. To make a valid higher bid, I can increase the quantity to 2 1s, as this is a reasonable assumption based on my hand and the possibility of the other player having at least one 1.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. Given that I have a 1 in my hand and Player 1 made the previous bid, it's likely they have more 1s. I'll increase the quantity and digit to 3 2s, which is a reasonable higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 2S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s and one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s. I have no 2s in my hand, so the total count of 2s is likely to be low. Bidding 4 4s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand, as it's unlikely there are 3 or more 2s in play.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 4S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 4 in my hand. The current bid is 4 4s. I can make a higher bid by keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit. Since I have a 4, I'm fairly confident in bidding 4 5s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s, which means there must be at least 4 fives in total. Since I only have one 5, there would need to be at least 3 more fives in Player 0's hand. Given the bid history and the fact that Player 0 has already bid 4 5s, it's plausible they have multiple 5s. However, I can increase the bid by either raising the quantity or the digit. I have two 8s, so bidding 5 8s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have a 5 in my hand. I can bid 6 5s, which is a higher quantity than the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 5S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 6 5s. I can see only one 5 in my hand, making the total possible 5s in play (including my opponent's hand) unlikely to exceed 6. Instead of bidding higher on 5s, I can bid on 8s, which I have more confidence in. Bidding 7 8s is a reasonable move, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 8S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 7 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 8s. I have a 5 in my hand and a 8. Bidding 8 8s seems reasonable, as it's a higher quantity of the same digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 8S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 8 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 8s. I have two 8s in my hand, and the maximum possible 8s in play is 16. Given the aggressive bidding history, it's unlikely there are more than 8 8s. I can either bid higher or challenge. Since I can't increase the quantity to 9 (as I only have 2 8s), I'll challenge the bid as it seems unlikely to be valid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) challenges Player 0's (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bid of 8 8s.
