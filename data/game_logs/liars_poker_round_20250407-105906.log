Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have three 6s. I will bid 3 6s to start.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one digit '6' is not present in my hand (84403301), but I have some other digits. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have any 6s, and my highest digit is 8, I can bid 3 8s, keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Since I don't know the other player's hand, I'll make a slightly higher bid to stay in the game. I'll bid 4 2s. This is a valid bid as it's higher than 3 8s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 2S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have one 2 in my hand (84403301), so it's possible there are 4 or more 2s in total. However, the previous bid was 3 8s, and I don't have any 8s, making it less likely that there are 4 or more 8s. The bid of 4 2s is relatively conservative. I will increase the bid by bidding 4 3s, as it is a higher digit and I have one 3 in my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 4 3s. I could bid 4 4s, but I don't have any 4s. I could bid 5 0s, which is a safe increase. I will bid 5 0s to increase the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, so the total count of 0s must be at least 1 and at most 9 (if the other player has 8 zeros, which is highly unlikely). I need to either make a higher bid or challenge. Given that I have one 0, bidding more than 5 0s seems risky unless I have a good reason to believe the other player has many 0s. However, I can bid a higher digit with the same quantity. Bidding 5 1s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I don't have any 1s in my hand. I could challenge, but it might be correct. I can raise the bid to 6 0s, which is a safe bet as the quantity increases and any digit is valid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have the hand 84403301, which contains one 0. The total count of 0s across both hands must be at least 6 for the current bid to be valid. Given that I have one 0, the other player must have at least 5 0s. While possible, it's a relatively high count. However, the bid is not extremely high since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. I should consider bidding higher. I can see that I have no 1s, so bidding 6 1s is not reasonable. However, I can bid higher on a different digit. Bidding 7 9s would be a valid higher bid, but it seems too aggressive. A more reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity or digit slightly. Bidding 6 2s or 7 0s are options. Since I have two 3s, bidding 6 3s seems plausible as it increases the digit. Alternatively, bidding 7 0s is also a valid option, but it requires the other player to have a high count of 0s. I'll choose to bid 7 0s, as it's a straightforward increase in quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 7 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. It's possible there are at least seven 0s between the two players, but it seems somewhat high given the previous bids. I could bid 8 0s, but I'll instead bid a slightly higher quantity with a digit I have in my hand. I have three 6s, so I can bid 8 6s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 6S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 8 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand is 84403301, which contains one 6. The total count of 6s across both hands must be at least 1 (mine) and at most 9 (if the other player has 8). Since 8 is within this range, the bid of 8 6s is plausible. However, bidding 8 7s or higher is possible and keeps the quantity the same while increasing the digit. I will bid 8 7s as it is a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 8 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 7s. I don't have any 7s in my hand. The bid is already quite high. I think it's unlikely that there are at least eight 7s in total. I will challenge.
