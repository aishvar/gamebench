Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits 8, 3, 8, 2, 7, 0, 1, 9. Counting the digits, I have two 8s, one 3, one 2, one 7, one 0, one 1, and one 9. The most frequent digit in my hand is 8 (appearing twice). A common opening strategy is to bid on your most frequent digit, as you already hold a solid base for that count. Given that, the safest and most strategic opening bid is 2 eights.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 8s'. I have one '8' in my hand (78026324). For the current bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) needs to have at least one '8'. This is statistically quite likely (8 digits for the opponent). Challenging feels too risky this early, as '2 8s' is a low and plausible bid. I need to make a higher bid. I have two '2's in my hand. Bidding '3 2s' is a valid higher bid (quantity increases from 2 to 3). This bid leverages my hand strength, as I already possess two of the required three '2's. It only requires the opponent to have one '2', which is statistically plausible. Other bids like '2 9s' (requiring two '9's from the opponent) or '3 8s' (requiring two '8's from the opponent) seem riskier.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits: 8, 3, 8, 2, 7, 0, 1, 9. I have exactly one '2' in my hand. The current bid is 3 '2's, which means the opponent is suggesting there are at least two more '2's in their hand. Since each player has 8 digits, the total is 16 digits. Statistically, the expected count of any digit is around 1.6, so 3 '2's overall is plausible but a bit above average. Given that I have 2 '8's, a safer and valid higher bid would be 3 '8's, which is equal in quantity but higher in digit, thus exceeding the current bid. This is a reasonable strategic move and avoids an early challenge when the bid is still plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 78026324. The current bid is '3 8s' made by Player 0. I have one '8' in my hand. For the bid '3 8s' to be true, Player 0 must have at least two '8's in their 8-digit hand. Player 0 initially bid '2 8s' and then raised to '3 8s' after my bid of '3 2s'. This escalation on their own digit could indicate they hold at least two '8's, making a challenge risky. Alternatively, it could be a strong bluff. I have two '2's in my hand. Bidding '4 2s' is a valid higher bid. This bid requires Player 0 to have at least two '2's. Given that I hold two '2's, claiming a total of four '2's across 16 digits is statistically plausible and leverages my hand's strength. It puts the pressure back on Player 0 without taking the immediate risk of a challenge.

Player 1 bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains one '2' (the digit '2' appears once). The current bid is 4 2s, meaning there must be at least four '2's across both hands. Since I only have one, my opponent would need to have at least three '2's for the bid to be valid. Given that each player has 8 digits, the probability of one player holding three or more '2's is relatively low. The prior bids show Player 1 increasing the count on 2s from 3 to 4, which may be a bluff to pressure me. Based on my hand and the statistical unlikelihood, I believe the bid is likely invalid.
