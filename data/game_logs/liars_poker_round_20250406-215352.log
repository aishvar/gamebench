Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to start the bidding. I have a diverse hand with digits ranging from 1 to 9. A safe initial bid would be 1 of a higher digit, such as 1 1s, which is reasonable given that I have the digit 1 in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 1 and one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 1 2s, which is quite low. Since I can see that I have at least one 2, I can confidently increase the bid. I will bid 2 2s, which is a higher quantity while keeping the same digit.
