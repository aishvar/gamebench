Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have three 7s and two 0s. Starting with a conservative yet strong opening based on my hand, I can confidently bid 3 7s, leveraging the fact I already possess that many.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s and zero 8s. Since the total number of digits is 16, for the bid of 3 8s to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least 3 8s, which is unlikely given I have none. The probability of the opponent having 3 or more 8s out of 8 digits is low. Therefore, challenging is the best strategic move.
