Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 7, and two 8s. Starting conservatively, a reasonable opening bid is 2 8s, as I already hold two 8s myself, making it likely or certain the total is at least two.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. Given that the current bid is quite low, I should think about my hand and see if I can make a reasonable bid. My hand contains the digits 9, 8, 1, 3, 7, 3, 0, 9. I have two 8s and two 3s and one 1, one 7, one 9, and one 0. I can see if I can make a higher bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. A bid of 3 8s seems reasonable as I have two 8s and can reasonably assume Player 0 might have one 8, making it 3 8s in total.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 50438027, I have two 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, so I only need my opponent to have at least one 8 for the bid to be valid. This is quite plausible, so challenging now is risky. To increase the bid, a safe incremental move is to bid 3 9s, which is higher in digit but keeps the quantity the same, and is a reasonable bluff since 9s are less likely to be numerous. Alternatively, bidding 4 of any digit would increase quantity, but without strong evidence, it's safer to increment the digit first.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and there are 8 digits in each player's hand, I should consider the possibility of there being more 9s. However, since I only have one 9, I will increase the quantity slightly and choose a higher digit to make a valid bid. The bid '4 0s' seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (50438027), I have two 0s. The current bid is 4 0s, meaning the opponent must have at least two 0s for the bid to be valid. This is plausible but somewhat risky. Bidding 4 1s or 4 2s would not be safer since I only have one 2 and no 1s. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to 5 of any digit, but I don't have enough of any digit to confidently do that. Given the relatively low probability that there are four or more 0s in total, challenging seems like the best move.
