Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand (digits: 31093202). Since the current bid is only 1 0s, it is very likely there are more 0s in total, and I can confidently increase the bid to 3 0s based solely on my own hand. This is a safe and strategic higher bid.

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 1s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 3, 1, 0, 9, 3, 2, 0, 2. Counting the number of 1s, I only have one. The current bid is 3 1s, which requires at least two additional 1s in Player 0's hand. Given the naive nature of Player 0 and typical distribution, it's unlikely they have two or more 1s, making the total at least 3. Therefore, challenging is a strong move here.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
