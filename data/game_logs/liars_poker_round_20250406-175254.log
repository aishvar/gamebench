Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 4s, one 1, one 3, one 6, and one 9. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be 2 0s or 2 4s, reflecting my actual count and not overcommitting early. I'll choose 2 0s as my opening bid.
