--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. As the first bidder, starting with a moderate bid on a high digit is strategic. Bidding 3 7s leverages my existing count while allowing room for the opponent to respond. With 16 total digits in play, the opponent likely has at least one 7, making this bid plausible yet challenging to counter.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 4, 8, 6, 2, 6, 1, 9, 2. I do not have any 7s, so the three 7s bid depends entirely on my opponent's hand. Three 7s is a plausible bid since the average count for any digit across 16 digits is around 1.6, so three is reasonable. To continue, I can either challenge or raise. Since I have two 6s, a safe higher bid is 3 8s, as I have one 8, and it's plausible my opponent has at least two. This increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a legal and strategic bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand. With 16 total digits (8 per player), Player 1's 3 8s bid requires them to hold all three. The probability of a player having â‰¥3 of a specific digit in 8 random digits is low (~3.8%). Given the low likelihood and strategic advantage in challenging improbable bids, challenging is the optimal move.
