Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, making it a strong candidate for bidding. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid of 2 6s, which is safe given my hand and allows for potential higher bids later.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (32732820), I don't have any 6s. The current bid is 2 6s, which means the opponent is claiming there are at least 2 sixes between both our hands. Since I have zero 6s, this means all the claimed 6s would have to be in the opponent's hand. This is certainly possible - they could have 2 or more 6s. Since this is just the first bid and it's a relatively low claim (2 of a digit), challenging would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid based on what I know about my hand. I have two 2s, two 3s, one 7, and one 8. I could bid 3 2s, which would be a higher quantity than the current bid, and I know I already have 2 of them in my hand, so I only need 1 more from my opponent's hand for this to be true.

Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 2s in my hand, making it uncertain if the opponent has at least 3. Challenging is a safer move as it could reveal a bluff.
