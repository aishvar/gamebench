Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits 9, 7, 6, 2, 0, 1, 1, 3. I have two 1s, which is the highest count of any digit in my hand. Statistically, starting with a bid of 3 1s is reasonable because with 16 digits in total, there's a good chance the opponent has at least one 1 as well.
