Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I can start the bidding with a reasonable estimate of the quantity of a specific digit in both players' hands. My hand contains the digits 5, 3, 8, and 2, with 5 appearing twice. I will bid on the digit '5' with a quantity of 2, as it is a plausible number given my hand, and it sets a foundation for the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 fives. Looking at my hand (97064168), I have zero 5s. Since I hold none, the entire count of fives relies on Player 0's hand. For the bid of 2 fives to be true, Player 0 must have exactly two or more 5s in their eight digits, which is somewhat unlikelyâ€”on average, each digit appears roughly 1.6 times across two hands (16 digits / 10 digits). Given that I have zero, the probability that Player 0 has both fives is low. Therefore, challenging is strategically sound.
