Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. It's likely the opponent has at least one 4 in their 8 digits, making 3 4s a reasonable opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 46527089, which contains one 4. The current bid is 3 4s. I need to make a higher bid than 3 4s. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 4, it's plausible that there are at least 3 4s in total. I will increase the digit to make a higher bid. Bidding 3 5s is a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, so the bidder would need to have at least three 5s out of eight digits, which is quite unlikely. It's safer to challenge than to bid higher.
