Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 74292857, which contains two 7s and two 8s, but no other digits more than twice. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and consider the total number of digits (32 across all players). Since I have two 7s and it's a relatively high digit, bidding 5 7s seems like a good starting point as it reflects a moderate increase based on the total number of players and digits.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. I can see that bidding 5 or more 7s or any quantity of a digit higher than 7 could be a valid move. However, considering my hand (55134376), I have a few 7s and other digits. I will increase the quantity to 6 and stick with a digit that I know exists in the pool of hands, which seems reasonable given the current bid and my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 7s

--- Turn: Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 7s in my hand. The current bid is 6 7s, which seems high given that the maximum possible is 32 digits across all players. Since I have no 7s, it's unlikely that there are 6 or more 7s in total. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
