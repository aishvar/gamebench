Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is None and I have two 5s in my hand, I can start with a conservative bid to open the game. Bidding 2 5s is a safe initial move based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s. Bidding 2 8s is a higher digit and matches the quantity I have, making it a safe and strategic move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 8S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, which means there must be at least one more 8 in the opponent's hand. Since the bid is still low and I have one 8, I can safely increase the bid to 3 8s, which is a higher quantity and still plausible given the game state.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 8s. If I challenge, the total number of 8s must be at least 3 for the bid to be valid. Since I have two, Player 0 likely has at least one, making the total 3 or more. Challenging would probably result in losing. Instead, I will bid 4 8s, as it's a higher quantity and I believe the total could be 4 or more with Player 0's contribution.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which means the opponent must have at least three 8s to make this bid valid. Given that the total number of 8s in the game is likely low, it's improbable that the opponent has three 8s. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
