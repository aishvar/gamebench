Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 3s, two 5s, one 9, and one 6. A conservative and reasonable opening bid would be 2 8s, reflecting my own hand and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (41960845), so the total count of 8s is at least 1. The bid of 2 8s is plausible because it's possible that Player 0 has at least one 8. However, I can bid higher. I can see that I have a 4 and a 5 and other digits, but no other 8s. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 2 9s is a reasonable move as it keeps the same quantity but increases the digit. It's a safe and strategic move.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 98186533, I have one 9 and two 8s. The current bid is 2 9s, and since I only have one 9, the opponent must have at least one 9 to make the bid truthful. That is plausible, so challenging now is risky. To make a safe higher bid, I can increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s is reasonable, as it only requires one more 8 from the opponent, which is quite likely given the distribution.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I see one 8, it's plausible there are more. However, bidding more than 4 8s seems risky. I can bid 3 9s, which is a valid higher bid because it has the same quantity but a higher digit. This is a reasonable move given the current state.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 3 9s, so for that bid to be valid, the opponent must hold at least two 9s. With 8 digits per player, this is plausible but not guaranteed. Since I only have one 9, and given the opponent's previous incremental bidding pattern, it's risky to assume they have two or more 9s. The probability favors that there are fewer than 3 total 9s. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
