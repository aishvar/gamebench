Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have one 0, two 1s, one 5, one 4, one 9, one 6. A safe starting bid would be to bid on a digit I have. I will bid 1 0s, as it's a low quantity and a low digit, minimizing risk. It's a valid first bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s, which is very low. Given my hand, I have 9 0s, which is the highest count of any digit. I should make a bid to increase the quantity of the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 9 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 10 0s is a logical next step, increasing the quantity. While it's a high number, it's within the realm of possibility and doesn't immediately scream 'bluff' to encourage a challenge back at me. A higher digit would require me to bluff completely, which is riskier at this stage.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 10 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 0s. I have 4 0s in my hand. Given the bid history, it seems likely that Player 0 has a significant number of 0s. Bidding 12 0s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 12 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 12 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 12 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. It's unlikely there are 12 0s in total, given only 16 digits exist across both hands. While I could attempt to bid higher, challenging seems more strategically sound. Bidding higher would require me to believe the bid is plausible, and I don't. A challenge has a reasonable chance of success.
