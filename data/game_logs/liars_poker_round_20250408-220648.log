Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (87459093), I have one 8, one 7, one 4, one 5, one 9, one 0, one 9, and one 3. I have two 9s, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. Since I have two 9s, and there are 8 more digits in the opponent's hand, I can reasonably expect there to be at least one more 9 in their hand. Making a conservative first bid of '3 9s' seems strategic - it's based on what I know I have, plus a reasonable assumption about the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, so the other player would need all 3 or more 9s. That seems unlikely with only 8 unknown digits. I'll challenge the bid.
