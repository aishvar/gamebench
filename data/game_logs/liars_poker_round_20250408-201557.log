Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 3s, two 0s, one 5, and one 7. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be 2 2s or 2 3s, reflecting my hand. I'll choose 2 3s as an opening bid, as 3s tend to be less suspicious and I hold two of them.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 7, 2, 7, 3, 5, 0, 3, 2. There are no 4s present, meaning all 4s must be in Player 1's hand to satisfy the current bid of 2 4s. While it's possible Player 1 has two or more 4s, it's unlikely given random distribution. However, since 2 4s is a low bid and not unreasonable, it's safer to increase the bid slightly rather than challenge now. I can bid 2 5s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit), and I have one 5 in hand, making this plausible.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits: 7, 2, 7, 3, 5, 0, 3, 2. There are zero 6s in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s, which means the opponent claims there are at least two 6s across both hands. Since I have none, the entire count depends on the opponent's hand. It is somewhat unlikely they have exactly two or more 6s out of their eight digits, but not impossible. Given the low bid, it is risky to challenge now, so a safer strategy is to increment the bid minimally. I will increase the digit to 2 7s, as I have two 7s, making that bid very safe.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 7, 2, 7, 3, 5, 0, 3, 2. There are no 8s in my hand. Since there are 16 digits in total and I hold half of them with zero 8s, all 8s, if any, must be in the opponent's hand. For the bid of 2 8s to be true, the opponent would need to have at least two 8s, which is plausible but not guaranteed. Given the opponent's naive bidding pattern and the fact that I have zero 8s, it's reasonable to challenge here rather than risk escalating on a potentially weak bid.
