Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 23162576, I have two 2s, two 6s, two 5s, one 3, one 1, and one 7. A safe opening bid would be 2 of a digit I have multiple of. I will start with '2 6s' since I have two 6s, making it a solid initial bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are more than 3 6s in total, considering the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 8 digits per player. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
