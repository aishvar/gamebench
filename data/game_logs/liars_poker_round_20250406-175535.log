Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a low bid based on my hand. I have two 9s, so I'll bid 2 9s to start.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I don't have any 0s in my hand. I could bid 3 1s, but that seems weak. I could also bid 4 0s. Since the previous bid was 2 9s, I could also bid 3 9s, since I have two 9s in my hand. However, bidding 4 0s seems like a better option as it increases the quantity.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Since the other player is Naive 50/50, I don't have a good read. I can bid higher, but I'm not confident about the number of 1s. I'll play it safe and bid 5 2s, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. Bidding 6 3s is a safe increase. Since the other player is a naive 50/50 player, they might challenge even if it's a reasonable bid, so I'll avoid making a riskier bid on a different number.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. Bidding 7 4s seems like a reasonable increase, and not too risky.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. The maximum number of 5s possible is 16. 7 is less than half of 16, so it's not an unreasonable bid. I could bid 8 0s, 8 1s, 8 2s, 8 3s, 8 4s, 8 5s, or 7 of 6, 7, 8, or 9. Since I have two 9s, bidding 7 9s seems like a reasonable and safe move. I'll bid 8 0s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Since the opponent is a naive 50/50 player, they might be bluffing. However, 8 is already a high quantity. I can increase the quantity to 9. Given my single 1, and the fact that 8 1s have already been bid, it is risky to bid higher on 1s. I will bid 9 2s, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. Bidding 10 3s is a safe increase. Given the bid history, it is unlikely that there are more than 9 3s, but challenging now is too risky.
