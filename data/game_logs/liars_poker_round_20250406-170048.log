Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make a valid higher bid. Since the current bid is 'None', I can bid any quantity and digit I like. I have a 5 in my hand and no other information about the players' hands. Bidding 1 5s seems like a safe starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding 2 5s is a valid option, but it doesn't significantly increase the risk for the opponent. I also have two 7s. Bidding 2 7s is also possible. However, given that the previous bid was only 1 5s, it's likely they don't have many 5s. Challenging seems like a reasonable move to test their claim, as it's unlikely there are even two 5s in total.
