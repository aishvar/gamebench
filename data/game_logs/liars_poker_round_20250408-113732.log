Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 2 and a 8 in my hand. With no bids yet, I should start with a conservative bid, focusing on a digit that is likely to be present in multiple hands. 3 2s seems like a reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given my hand is 69734689, I have one 2, but I also notice I have multiple occurrences of higher digits. The current bid is 3 2s, which seems plausible but not extremely high. Considering I have digits like 6 and 9, which are higher than 2, and given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, bidding a higher quantity of a lower digit or the same quantity of a higher digit could be strategic. However, since I only have one 2 and no information about the other player's hand, challenging the current bid might not be the best move unless I have a strong reason to believe it's false. Given my hand and the goal to make a strictly higher bid, I could consider bidding on a digit I have multiple of, but since the bid needs to be strictly higher, I must either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Bidding on a digit I have, like 6 or 9, with a quantity of 3 or more could be risky without knowing the other player's hand. Thus, a safer approach might be to slightly increase the quantity of a digit that is not too high, considering the balance between risking a challenge and making a believable bid. However, given the rules and my hand, a straightforward strategy would be to bid on a digit that I think could plausibly occur more than the current bid, taking into account the total possible occurrences across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 2 in my hand, which supports the current bid. However, I don't have any other 2s, and the current bid quantity is 4. I can try to bid a higher quantity for a different digit, but since the current bid is for 2s, I'll choose a different digit. I have a 7 in my hand and no other digits are over 8, so I'll bid a higher quantity for a digit that's not 2.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 4 2s. Bidding 2 2s seems a reasonable move, matching the digit and quantity but with my own perspective.
