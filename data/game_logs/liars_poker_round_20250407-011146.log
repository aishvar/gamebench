Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 26913292. I have three 2s, one 1, one 3, one 6, and two 9s. The digit 2 appears most frequently (3 times). With 16 total digits in play (8 in my hand, 8 in the opponent's), the expected number of any digit is 1.6. Having three 2s is significantly above average. It's statistically likely (around 57% probability, expected value 0.8) that the opponent has at least one 2. Therefore, bidding '4 2s' (my 3 + at least 1 from opponent) is a reasonably strong and plausible opening bid based on my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s and two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 2s, which seems plausible since there are 16 digits total. However, I can increase the bid by leveraging my hand. I can bid 4 8s, which is a valid move as it maintains the same quantity but increases the digit significantly.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand (26913292). For the bid to be accurate, my opponent must have at least four 8s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of having four or more of a specific digit out of eight is very low (approximately 0.5%). Given these odds, it is highly likely the opponent does not have four 8s, making a challenge the most strategic move.
