Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 2 7s is plausible since there's a reasonable chance the opponent has a 7. Choosing a higher digit (7) sets a strategic starting point, forcing the next player to either increase the quantity or bid an even higher digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable move because it increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same, and it's a valid higher bid. I do not have any 7s in my hand, so challenging is not a good option.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I can raise by choosing a higher digit at the same quantity. I have one 6 in my hand, so bidding 3 6s increases the digit to 6 while keeping the quantity the same. This shifts the focus to a digit I hold, making it potentially more credible unless the opponent has multiple 6s.

Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s and two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand and the fact that the other player has already bid 3 5s, indicating they might have some 5s or 6s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand has only one 6. For the bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least three 6s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of them having three or more 6s is low (~3.8%), making challenging a favorable option.
