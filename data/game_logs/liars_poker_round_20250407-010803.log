Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. My hand is 10534916. I have two 1s, which is the highest frequency of any digit in my hand. The expected average count for any digit across all 16 digits (2 players * 8 digits) is 1.6. Since I hold two 1s, bidding '2 1s' is a reasonable and informative opening bid based directly on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 1s in my hand, which makes the current bid of 2 1s somewhat plausible but not guaranteed. However, I have two 2s in my hand, which makes bidding 3 2s a safe and reasonable choice. This increases the quantity and changes the digit, adhering to the rules for a valid bid.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have zero 2s in my hand (10534916). For the bid to be accurate, the opponent (Player 1) must have at least three 2s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively low (approx. 3.8% for exactly 3, slightly higher for 3+). Since I hold none of the required digit, the burden falls entirely on the opponent. While I could make a bid like '4 1s' based on my two 1s, challenging the '3 2s' bid seems statistically favorable as it requires the opponent to hold a significant concentration of 2s.
