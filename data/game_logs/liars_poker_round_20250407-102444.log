Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 5s, two 8s, one 1, one 3, and one 6. A safe conservative opening bid would be 2 of any of my more frequent digits. Choosing '2 5s' as my opening bid leverages a digit I have two of, making it likely that at least two 5s exist across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s (digits: 5,1,3,2,8,2,5,6). The current bid is 2 6s, which matches exactly what I hold. Since I know I have two 6s, it is quite plausible there might be one more 6 in the opponent's hand, so a bid of 3 6s is reasonable and safe. This is a minimal raise that is strictly higher, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same.
