Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 2 6s is a safe and reasonable move, as it's a higher digit and I have the necessary count to support it.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '6' in my hand. The current bid is '2 6s', which means there must be at least two '6's in total. Since I only have one, it's possible the other player has at least one more '6'. However, the bid is still relatively low, so I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Given that I have a '7' and an '8' in my hand, which are higher digits, I can make a bid that increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 7s. Since I only have one, it's uncertain if Player 1 has another. Challenging is a calculated risk as it could reveal whether the total meets the bid.
