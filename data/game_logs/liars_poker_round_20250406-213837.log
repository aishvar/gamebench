Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 29520483, I notice that I have two 2s. Since the goal is to make a bid that is reasonable yet strategic, bidding on a digit I have in abundance is a good starting point. Bidding on the digit 2 seems like a safe start because it's a low digit, and having at least one 2 in each player's hand is plausible. Thus, bidding 2 2s seems like a conservative yet reasonable opening move.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 2 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 1, 8, 5, 8, 0, 3, 6, 6. I have zero 2s, so the current bid of 2 2s means Player 0 is claiming there are at least two 2s across both hands. Since I have none, all 2s would have to be in Player 0's hand, which is possible but not guaranteed. However, bidding just 3 of any digit seems safer than challenging this early, especially since I hold two 8s and two 6s, which are strong bases to increase the bid. I'll raise to 3 8s, leveraging my two 8s plus a reasonable chance Player 0 has at least one 8.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which is possible but not guaranteed since I don't have information about Player 1's hand. Considering the bid history, Player 1 raised the bid from 2 2s to 3 8s, indicating they might have a strong hand or are trying to bluff. Given that I only have one 8, bidding a higher quantity of 8s would be risky without more information. However, I can try to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, as this is considered a higher bid. The next higher digit after 8 is 9, but since I don't have any 9s in my hand, this could also be risky. Another option is to challenge the bid if I think it's unlikely, but without knowing Player 1's hand, this is also a gamble. Given my hand and the current bid, a safer approach might be to bid on a digit I have more information about or challenge if the bid seems too high. Since the current bid is 3 8s and I only have one 8, I should consider if having at least three 8s in total is plausible. If I had two or more 8s, I might consider bidding higher on 8s, but with only one, the risk is high. Challenging seems like a viable option because if Player 1 is bluffing or doesn't have enough 8s to meet the bid, I could win. However, this decision heavily depends on the likelihood of Player 1's bid being true, which is hard to assess without more information. Given the uncertainty and my hand, a more strategic move would be to challenge the current bid, hoping that Player 1 doesn't have enough 8s to fulfill it.
