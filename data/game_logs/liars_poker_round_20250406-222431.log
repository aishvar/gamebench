Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a low bid. I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding one 5 is a safe starting point.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 1 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I don't have any 5s to support the current bid, and while challenging 1 5s carries roughly a 57% risk that the opponent has a 5, I can make a safe bid using my own cards. I hold two 0s, which guarantees at least 2 zeros in play. Bidding '2 0s' is a strictly higher bid than '1 5s' since the quantity increases, and it puts pressure on the opponent with a bid I know is true.

Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) bids: 2 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity to 3 and keeping the digit at 0, or I can increase the digit. I'll bid 3 0s. This is a small increase, but it's safer than challenging immediately.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 0s
