Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have a hand with digits 7, 1, 0, 0, 4, 6, 8, 5, I should start with a modest bid that reflects the distribution in my hand. I have two 0s, which is a good starting point. Bidding '2 0s' is a safe initial bid based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 98233773, which contains no 0s. Since I have zero 0s, and the current bid is only 2 0s, it's quite plausible that among the remaining 24 digits, there are at least 2 zeros. Therefore, challenging now would be risky. The minimal safe move is to increase the bid by either raising the quantity or the digit. Since 2 0s is the current bid, a straightforward higher bid is 2 1s, which is a minimal raise and keeps me in the game without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I can see my hand which is 29208069. I have one 1 in my hand. Considering there are 4 players and each has 8 digits, the total count of 1s could be higher than 2. However, bidding higher quantity might be risky. I can try to increase the digit. Since I have a 2 and a 9, I can bid on 2s or 9s. Bidding 2 2s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit than 1s and still a relatively low quantity.

--- Turn: Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have a 2 in my hand, and given that there are 8 secret digits per player and 4 players, the total possible count for any digit is 32. The bid of 2 2s seems low but not impossible. However, without knowing the exact distribution of digits in other players' hands, I must make an educated guess. Since I have one 2, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 3 2s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and I have a 2 in my hand.

Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one '2' in my hand. The current bid is 3 '2's, which means there needs to be at least two more '2's among the other three players' hands (24 digits total). Given that the bid has only increased by one from the previous bid (2 '2's), it's plausible that there are at least three '2's in total. However, since I only have one, I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Considering the risk of challenging and the relatively low bid, I'll increase the bid to 3 '4's, as I have one '4' in my hand and this moves the bid to a higher digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 4S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 98233773, I have no 4s. The current bid is 3 4s, which requires at least three 4s across all players. Since I have zero 4s, the remaining three players would need to collectively hold at least three 4s, which is plausible but not certain. However, I have three 3s in my hand, so a safe and natural higher bid is 3 5s, 3 6s, 3 7s, 3 8s, or 3 9s (raising the digit but keeping the quantity), or increasing the quantity to 4 of any digit. Given my three 3s, a conservative but solid move is bidding 4 3s, leveraging my strong holding in 3s and increasing the quantity, which is a strictly higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have the hand 29208069, which contains one 3. To determine the likelihood of the bid being true, I need to consider the total count of 3s across all players. With 8 players having 8 digits each, there are 32 digits in total. My hand has one 3. The bid of 4 3s implies that there are at least four 3s in total. This is possible but I need to assess if it's likely. Since I have one 3, there are 24 digits left in other players' hands. If the remaining three 3s are distributed among the other players, it's plausible. However, I can bid higher to try and push the challenge further down the line or potentially get a more favorable outcome. I can bid 4 4s or 5 0s, for example. Bidding 4 4s seems reasonable as it increases the digit, and I have a 9 and other digits but no 4s, so it's a relatively safe increase. Bidding 5 0s would be a significant increase in quantity. Given my hand, I see two 0s and two 9s (which are not relevant to the bid directly), so bidding on 0s might not be a bad idea since I have some information about it. However, increasing the quantity significantly without a strong hand for the digit might not be wise. Thus, bidding 4 4s is a balanced move.

--- Turn: Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is the better option. My hand contains the digits 0, 1, 1, 5, 5, 8, 9, 9. I have a total of 2 fours, but no information about other players' hands. Given that the bid is 4 4s, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 5s and two 9s, but no 4s or 6s, 7s, or 8s, I should consider bidding on a digit that I have. The highest quantity I can confidently bid on a digit I have is 2 9s, but I should check if there's a possibility to bid higher on a digit that might be less common. However, I only have two digits that could potentially be high: 5s and 9s. I can try to bid on 5s or 9s. I have two 5s and two 9s, so bidding 3 5s or 3 9s seems reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand (from 71004685). The current bid is 5 9s, which seems high given that there are only 32 digits in total and the bidding has escalated quickly. The probability that there are at least 5 9s across all players is low, especially since the bid history shows a rapid increase. Challenging seems like the best move.
