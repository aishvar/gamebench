--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 63930250. I see that I have one 0, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 6, and two 9s. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. Since I have two 9s, bidding '2 9s' seems like a safe and reasonable start, as it reflects the count of a digit I have in my hand.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, which slightly decreases the likelihood of there being at least two 9s across all hands. However, with 32 digits in play, it's still quite plausible that there are two or even more 9s among the other players. Since the current bid is relatively low and safe, challenging now would be premature. A natural way to increase the bid is to keep the quantity at 2 but pick a higher digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, the only valid higher bid must increase the quantity. I can bid 3 of a lower digit where I have some knowledge. I have two 7s, so bidding 3 7s leverages my hand strength and is a reasonable incremental raise.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. Given that there are 4 players with 8 digits each, the maximum possible 7s is 32, but realistically, having 3 or more 7s across all hands is plausible. Since I have one, it's possible others have at least two more. To stay in the game, I can make a conservative higher bid by increasing the digit to 8, which I also have one of in my hand. Bidding 3 8s is a safe next move.

Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more likely to succeed. My hand contains the digits 8, 5, 6, 3, 2, and 4, but no 8s or 9s or 7s or higher quantity of any digit that could immediately threaten the current bid of 3 8s. However, I do have a few digits that could potentially be part of a higher bid. Given that I have one 8 and no information about other players' hands, I should consider if I can reasonably make a bid that is higher than 3 8s. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should look for a digit that I have multiple instances of and bid higher than 3 if possible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (63930250), so the total count of 8s must be at least 1 (mine) plus whatever others have. Given that there are 3 other players and assuming they might have at least one 8 between them, the total count could be higher. However, bidding higher than 4 8s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. I can increase the digit to 9s, so bidding 4 9s is a valid move. I also have one 9 in my hand, which supports the possibility that there could be more 9s. Thus, bidding 4 9s is a reasonable next step.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (23077506), I have zero 9s. The current bid is 4 9s, which would require at least four 9s across all 32 digits. Since I hold none, the probability that the other three players collectively have four or more 9s is low, especially given that no one previously bid on 9s until Player 0 did. This late jump to 4 9s without incremental bidding on 9s seems suspicious. Therefore, I believe challenging is the optimal move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bid of 4 9s.
