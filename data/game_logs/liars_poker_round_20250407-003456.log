Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current state, I should start by examining my own hand for potential high-value digits. I have a 9 in my hand, which gives me a good starting point. Since the current bid is None, I can make any bid I want. I'll aim to create a plausible-sounding bid to establish a baseline.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 9s. Since there are only 16 digits in total and I have none, it's unlikely there are 2 or more 9s in play. I should challenge the bid rather than making a higher bid that I cannot confidently support.
