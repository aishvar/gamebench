Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Since it's the first bid, I can start with a lower quantity but choose a higher digit for strategic flexibility. Bidding 2 6s is a safe and reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s, which means there could be at least two 6s in total. Since I don't have any 6s, the only way this bid could be true is if Player 0 has both 6s. However, I can safely increase the bid by choosing a higher quantity or a higher digit. Given my hand, I have two 2s, so bidding 3 2s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit based on my hand.

Player 0 response was not valid JSON: 'To determine the best move, I analyzed my hand and the current bid. My hand contains two 6s, which provides a foundation to bid on 6s. The current bid is 3 2s, and I can make a higher bid by choosing a higher digit. Bidding 3 6s is a strategic move as it increases the digit from 2 to 6, making it a valid higher bid. This action puts pressure on the opponent and is based on the presence of 6s in my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 3 3s is a higher bid than 3 2s because 3s are higher than 2s. This bid is plausible if Player 1 has at least one 3, making the total count 3 or more.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 3s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have two 3s, increasing the quantity to 4 3s is not possible without risking a challenge. However, I can bid 3 4s, as I have one 4 in my hand, which increases the digit while keeping the same quantity. This seems like a safe and reasonable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 4s. Bidding 3 6s is a higher bid since 6 is greater than 4, and I have two 6s, making it plausible that the total could be three if the opponent has one.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which is already higher than what I can confidently claim with my hand. Given the bid history, increasing the quantity or digit further seems risky without more 6s. Challenging might be the safer option, but I should consider if the opponent could have multiple 6s. Since I only have one 6, challenging is the best move to avoid an overbid.
