Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. I'll start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 1s, two 5s, and one 9. The highest digit I have multiple of is 1 and 5. I can start with a bid of 2 1s or 2 5s or 2 5s. I'll choose to bid 2 1s as it's a good starting point.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. My hand is 26007736, which contains no 1s. Given that there are 3 players and 8 digits each, there are 24 digits in total. The bid of 2 1s is relatively low, and it's possible that the other players have some 1s. I have two options: either challenge the bid or make a higher bid. Since my hand doesn't contain any 1s, challenging seems risky as there are 16 digits out of my sight, and it's plausible they have at least 2 1s among them. I'll choose to make a higher bid. The next possible bid can either be 2 2s or 3 0s. Bidding 3 0s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity, and I can see I have two 0s in my hand, making it somewhat plausible that there are at least 3 0s in total.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s, which means there need to be at least 2 more 0s among the other players' hands. This is certainly possible. Looking at the bid history, Player 0 started with 2 1s, which Player 1 raised to 3 0s rather than challenging. This suggests Player 1 might have at least one 0. I can either raise the bid or challenge. Since I have one 0, and it's reasonable that there could be two more among the other players, challenging seems risky. I'll make a higher bid. I have two 5s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 5s. I'll bid 3 5s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value.

Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid can be beaten. My hand contains the digits 9, 1, 4, 9, 6, 1, 5, 7. I have two 1s and two 9s. The bid of 3 5s seems low but I need to ensure my bid is higher and valid. I can see if I increase the quantity or the digit, I can make a valid bid. Since I have two 1s and two 9s, bidding 4 1s seems reasonable as it's a higher quantity than 3 and a higher digit than 0, also considering I only have one 5 and one 6 which makes 4 6s or 4 5s less likely to win if challenged.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I need to bid higher, either by increasing the quantity or bidding the same quantity with a higher digit. My hand is 26007736, which contains no 1s. I have two 0s and other digits distributed. Since the current bid is 4 1s, I can either bid 5 or more of any digit, or bid 4 of a digit higher than 1. Given my hand and the fact that there are 24 total digits, bidding 4 2s seems reasonable as it meets the criteria of being higher than 1 and is a relatively safe bet considering the distribution of digits.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (01030528), I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 5, one 2, and one 8. The current bid is '4 2s', meaning there are supposedly at least 4 twos across all players' hands. I only have one 2 in my hand, so there would need to be at least 3 more twos between the other two players. This is possible but not guaranteed. I could challenge, but it's a moderate risk. Alternatively, I could make a higher bid. Since I have one 5 in my hand, and I previously bid '3 5s' (which wasn't challenged), I could reasonably bid '4 5s' which would be higher than '4 2s' because 5 > 2. I also have one 3 in my hand, so I could bid '4 3s'. I think bidding '4 5s' is safer than challenging at this point, as it's still early in the game and the current bid of '4 2s' is plausible.

Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have two 6s in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and there are 8 secret digits per player, I should consider the likelihood of there being at least 4 fives in total. Since I do not have any 5s in my hand, I will assume the other players have a maximum of 2 fives each. With 3 players, if I bid higher than 4, I risk being wrong. However, bidding a higher digit with a reasonable quantity seems like a good strategy. I will bid 5 6s, increasing both the quantity and digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. My hand is 26007736, which contains one 6. I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. The total count of 6s across all hands must be at least 1 (from my hand) plus the count from the other two players' hands. Since I have one 6, I need at least 4 more 6s from the other two players for the bid to be valid. While possible, it's a bit high. However, I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 5 7s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and is based on my hand having two 7s. This makes my bid more credible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. In my hand, I have 01030528, which contains: one 0, one 1, two 3s, one 5, one 8, and no 7s. The current bid is '5 7s'. Since I have zero 7s in my hand, there would need to be at least 5 7s between the other two players' hands. Each player has 8 digits, so there are 24 total digits in play. The probability of having 5 or more 7s when I have none is not extremely low, but it's getting less likely as the bid increases. Looking at the bid history, Player 1 has been consistently raising, moving from 3 0s to 4 2s to 5 7s, which could indicate they have some 7s. However, I think I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. Since I have one 5 and one 8, I could reasonably bid '5 8s' (same quantity but higher digit) or increase the quantity to '6' with a lower digit that I have in my hand, like '6 0s', '6 1s', '6 3s', or '6 5s'. Given that I have two 3s in my hand, bidding '6 3s' seems most reasonable.

Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 6 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 9, 1, 4, 9, 6, 1, 5, and 7. I have a total of 2 sixes and other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. However, I should assess the likelihood of the current bid being valid and consider my own digits. Since I have two 6s and the bid is 6 3s, I should think about if there's a possibility that there are indeed 6 or more 3s in total. Given that I have no 3s in my hand, it's less likely that I can accurately challenge. I should consider making a bid that seems reasonable and higher than the current bid of 6 3s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 4S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 4s. My hand is 26007736, which contains two 7s and no 4s. I need to make a bid that is higher than 7 4s. I can either bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I see a 7 in my hand and the previous bid was 5 7s, I can infer that there are at least a few 7s out there. Bidding 7 5s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit. However, considering the quantity, 7 is not very high given the maximum possible is 24. I should think about bidding a higher quantity or a digit that is more likely to be abundant. Given my hand, I see two 6s and the previous bid was 5 6s, indicating there are likely more than 5 6s. Thus, bidding 8 6s seems like a reasonable and safe move as it increases the quantity and is based on a digit that appears in my hand and has been bid upon previously.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 8 6s

--- Turn: Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (01030528), I have zero 6s. The current bid is 8 6s, which means Player 1 is claiming there are at least 8 sixes across all players' hands. Since I have none, all 8 would need to be between the other two players, who have 16 digits total. That's certainly possible but seems somewhat unlikely. Looking at the bid history, Player 0 previously bid 5 6s, suggesting they might have some 6s in their hand. Player 1 then jumped to 8 6s, which is a significant increase. This could be a bluff. Given that I have no 6s myself, and the bid is getting quite high for a single digit, I think challenging is the best move here rather than making a higher bid that would be even more difficult to sustain.
