Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s and two 9s in my hand. With no existing bid, starting with two 9s is strategic since 9 is the highest digit, forcing the next player to either increase the quantity or challenge. Even if the opponent has no 9s, the total (2) meets the bid, making it safe.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s. Since there are 16 digits total and I hold 8 of them, the opponent's hand contains the other 8. For the bid of 2 9s to be valid, the opponent must have at least 2 9s, given that I have none. The probability of 2 or more 9s in 8 unknown digits is moderate but not guaranteed. However, with only a low bid of 2 9s, it's quite plausible they have two or even one 9, so challenging now is risky. Instead, I will raise the bid to 2 9s' next highest valid bid, which is 2 9s -> 2 9s (invalid, same bid), or 2 9s -> 3 0s (quantity increase), or 2 9s -> 2 0s (lower digit, invalid), or 2 9s -> 2 9s (same, invalid), or 2 9s -> 2 9s (same, invalid), or 2 9s -> 2 9s (same, invalid), or 2 9s -> 3 1s (quantity increase). Looking at my hand, I have three 1s. So bidding 3 1s is a strong choice, as I know I hold 3 myself, making that bid certainly true.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 1s in my hand. The current bid is 3 1s, meaning Player 1 must have all three 1s in their own hand. The probability of holding three 1s in an 8-digit hand is relatively low (~3.3%), making this bid statistically unlikely. Since my hand eliminates any contribution to the 1s count, challenging is a calculated risk.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) challenges Player 1's (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bid of 3 1s.
