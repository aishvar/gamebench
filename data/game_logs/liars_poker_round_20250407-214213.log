Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, the digit '2' appears twice, and '9' appears twice as well. Both are strong candidates for an opening bid. Typically, starting with a conservative bid of 2 of a digit I hold multiple of is strategic. I will choose '2' because it appears twice and tends to be less obvious than 9, which might encourage a quick raise or challenge. Therefore, a safe and reasonable opening bid is '2 2'.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. My hand has no 2s (0 in my digits), so the opponent must have at least 2 2s for the bid to be valid. However, I have three 7s, which allows me to bid a higher quantity (3) of a digit (7). This bid exceeds the current bid in quantity (3 > 2) and is safer given my hand. Challenging the bid risks losing if the opponent has 2 2s, so raising is preferable.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (82963492), there are no 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, which means there should be at least 3 sevens across both hands. Since I have zero 7s, the entire count depends on Player 1's hand. For the bid to be valid, Player 1 must hold at least 3 sevens among their 8 digits, which is quite unlikely statistically. The probability of a player having 3 or more of the same digit in 8 cards is relatively low (~10%), especially since I have none. Therefore, it is reasonable to challenge this bid rather than risk making an unlikely higher bid.
