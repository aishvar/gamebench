Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I need to start the bidding, I should base my bid on the digits in my hand. I have one 4, two 6s, one 7, and one 0. A reasonable opening bid would be 2 6s, as I already have two 6s in my hand, making it a safe and logical starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have a 6 in my hand, which means there are at least 3 sixes in total (1 from my hand and 2 from the bid). I should bid higher than 2 6s. Since my hand contains one 6, bidding 3 6s seems reasonable and increases the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 6s. This means there need to be at least one more 6 in Player 1's hand to make the bid valid. Since it is plausible that Player 1 has at least one 6, I will increase the bid to 4 6s, as it is a logical step forward given my hand and the game state.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. I have one 6 in my hand, and the total count of 6s could be higher given the bidding history. However, bidding higher than 4 6s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have many high digits, I should consider what I can reasonably bid. I have a 6 in my hand, so bidding 5 6s seems possible but risky without knowing the opponent's hand. A safer bet would be to increase the digit but not the quantity, like bidding 4 7s, or increase both.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. In my hand, I have one 7. To meet the bid, there would need to be at least three 7s in Player 1's hand, which is plausible but not guaranteed. However, I can reasonably increase the bid based on my hand. I have two 6s and one 4, making 6s a strong candidate for a higher bid. Bidding 5 6s increases the quantity while staying within a plausible range based on the total of 16 digits in play.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. I have a few 6s in my hand, but not enough to guarantee a win if challenged. However, I do have a high number of 1s and 2s which aren't being utilized yet. Since my hand contains 2 1s, 1 2, 1 6, and other digits, I can try to bid higher on a digit that is likely to exist given the hands. The digit '6' has already been bid high, so I should consider bidding on a different digit or challenging. Given that I have two 2s and no information about other digits, bidding on 7s or higher digits seems reasonable if I can make a strong case for quantity. However, I only have one 6 and the other player seems focused on 6s. I should consider increasing the quantity or digit strategically.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s, meaning there must be at least six 2s across both hands. In my hand (94347605), I have no 2s, which makes it very unlikely that Player 1 has six or more 2s in their hand of eight digits. Given the bid history, Player 1 has been gradually increasing bids, but this particular bid seems improbable based on my hand. I should challenge the bid rather than risk making an unlikely higher bid.
