Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a starting bid. I have two 2s and two 5s. Bidding a small quantity of one of these seems reasonable. I will bid 2 2s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 2s, so all 2s would need to be in Player 0's hand to satisfy the current bid of 2 2s, which is plausible. Since the bid is quite low, challenging now is risky. To maintain pressure and avoid a premature challenge, I'll make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, choosing 2 3s since I have one 3 in my hand, making it quite plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. Bidding 3 0s is a safe increase, and I have a 0 in my hand.

Player 0 bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 61673947, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 3 0s relies entirely on my opponent having at least 3 zeros, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. Since zeros are generally less frequent and I hold none, the total zeros across both hands are likely less than 3. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
