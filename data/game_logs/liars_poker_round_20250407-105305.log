Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s, two 7s, two 0s, one 1, one 5, and one 8. Since the current bid is only 1 0s and I hold two 0s myself, I know the actual count of 0s is at least 2, making the current bid very safe. The minimal valid raise is either increasing the digit with the same quantity or increasing the quantity. Given that, a straightforward and safe higher bid is 2 0s, which is guaranteed true based on my hand alone.
