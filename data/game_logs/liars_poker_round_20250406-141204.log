Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid. I will start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s, so bidding 2 6s seems reasonable.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the situation carefully. The current bid is '2 6s', which is a fairly low bid. Looking at my hand (34315705), I don't have any 6s. This means all 6s must be in the other players' hands. With 2 other players having 8 digits each, there could be up to 16 sixes total. The probability of having at least 2 sixes among 16 random digits is quite high, so challenging would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity but increase the digit. Looking at my own hand, I have one 7 and one 5, so I could confidently bid '2 7s' (keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit). Alternatively, I could bid '3' of a digit I have in my hand, like '3 3s' since I have one 3. I'll go with '2 7s' as it's a safer incremental raise.

Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (97643760). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I see one 7, it's possible there are more 7s. Increasing the quantity to 3 7s seems reasonable. However, I can also consider bidding with a higher digit. I have a 9, which is the highest digit. Bidding 2 9s would be a higher bid than 2 7s. Given that I have one 9, it's plausible that there are at least two 9s in total among all players.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have two 6s in my hand, and the bid history shows increasing digits but not quantities. Given that my hand contains two 6s, I can confidently bid higher. The current bid is 2 9s, so I need to bid higher than 2 or bid the same quantity with a higher digit, or bid a higher quantity with the same or higher digit. Since I have two 6s, I can safely bid a higher quantity with a higher digit. The bid '3 6s' seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and digit compared to previous bids.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '3 6s'. Looking at my hand (34315705), I don't have any 6s. The previous player bid '3 6s', which means they believe there are at least 3 sixes among all players. Since I have no 6s, all 3 would need to come from the other two players. Each player has 8 digits, so it's certainly possible that the other two players combined have 3 or more 6s. Given that Player 0 started with a bid of '2 6s' and then raised to '3 6s', they likely have at least 1-2 sixes themselves. I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. I could bid '3 7s' (same quantity, higher digit) or '4' of something. I have one 7 and one 5 in my hand, so bidding based on these digits gives me some confidence. I'll go with '3 7s' since it's the minimal valid raise and I have one 7 in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (97643760). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I see one 7, it's possible there are at least three 7s in total. However, bidding more than 3 7s with just this information is tricky. I can bid 3 8s, which is a higher bid. I have one 8 (though it's not actually there, I see no 8s), but it's still a possible bid as I'm not sure what others have. Bidding 4 7s or higher quantity seems risky without more information. Thus, bidding 3 8s is a reasonable next step.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 6, 0, 1, 9, 2, 1, 8, 1. I have a total of 2 8s in my hand, making the current bid of 3 8s plausible but I need to verify if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is the best option. Since I have two 6s and the last bid was 3 8s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I see that bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it's higher than 3 and I have two 6s in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of '4 6s'. Looking at my hand (34315705), I don't have any 6s. The bid history shows Player 0 has been consistently bidding on 6s, increasing from 2 to 3 to 4, which suggests they likely have multiple 6s in their hand. However, without any 6s in my own hand, and with Player 0 claiming there are at least 4 across all hands, I need to consider if this is reasonable. If Player 0 has 3-4 sixes and Player 2 has 0-1, then the bid could be valid. Since I don't have strong evidence to challenge yet, and the bid of 4 is still relatively low (out of a possible 24 digits), I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have a 7, so I'll bid on 7s with a higher quantity: 5 7s.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have the digits 97643760 in my hand, which contains one 7. This means there are 7 other digits in the other players' hands. The total count of 7s across all hands must be at least 2 (my 7 and the one I can infer from the bid history). To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Bidding 6 7s seems plausible because it increases the quantity, and it's possible that the other players have more 7s. However, bidding 5 8s is also an option as it keeps the same quantity but bids on a higher digit. Given that the previous bid was 3 8s by Player 2 (me), and then Player 0 bid 4 6s, it's likely that there are some 8s or higher digits around. I'll choose to bid 5 8s as it maintains the quantity and bids on a higher digit, making it a relatively safe and strategic move.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains 2 sixes, and I see that the previous bids have been relatively conservative. Given that I have two 6s and the last bid was 5 8s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24, and with 8 secret digits per player, there could be many 8s in play. However, I also see that there are limited 6s and 7s in my hand compared to 8s and 9s which have been bid. I will increase the quantity and bid 6 6s as my next move.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (34315705), I don't have any 6s. The current bid is 6 6s. From the bidding history, Player 0 has bid on 6s multiple times (2 6s, 3 6s, 4 6s, and now 6 6s), which suggests they likely have several 6s in their hand. However, for there to be 6 6s total, Player 2 would need to have some as well. Given that Player 2 has been bidding on 8s and 9s, they might not have many 6s either. I have a 7 in my hand, and I've previously bid on 7s, so I could bid 6 7s, which would be higher than 6 6s. This seems like a reasonable bid based on my knowledge of my hand and the bidding patterns.

Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand is 97643760, which contains one 7. I can count the total number of 7s I have seen so far in the bid history: 2 7s, 3 7s, 5 7s, 6 7s. It's likely that there are at least 6 sevens in total because multiple players have bid on 7s. I have one 7, so the total count of 7s is at least 1 (mine) + some from other players. To make a higher bid, I can either bid 7 0s (increasing quantity) or 6 8s (same quantity, higher digit). Since my hand contains an 8 and an even higher digit (9), and considering the previous bids, bidding 6 8s seems reasonable as it matches the quantity and increases the digit. However, I should also consider the likelihood of the total count of 8s. In the bid history, we had bids on 8s and 9s, indicating some players might have these digits. My hand has one 7 and one 8 (and a 9), supporting a potential higher count for 8s or 9s. Bidding 6 8s is a safe increase in digit without overly inflating the quantity.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. Given that I have two 6s and one 8, and considering the bid history, I should assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains two 6s, and I see that the previous bids have been relatively conservative. I also note that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24, and with 8 secret digits per player, there are 24 digits in total. The current bid of 6 8s seems high but not impossible. However, I don't have enough information to confidently challenge. I will make a bid that seems reasonable and higher than the current bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have 8 digits in my hand: 34315705. Looking at my hand, I don't have any 6s. The current bid is 7 6s, which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 7 sixes across all players' hands. Since I have 0 sixes, all 7 would need to come from the other two players who have 16 digits between them. While possible, this seems unlikely, especially given that Player 0 has consistently bid on 6s throughout the game, gradually increasing from 2 to 7. This suggests they may have several 6s in their hand and are trying to leverage their strong holding. However, 7 out of 16 remaining digits (43.75%) being 6s is quite high. I think this bid is risky enough to challenge.
