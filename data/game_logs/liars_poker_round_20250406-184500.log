Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 5s, one 7, one 4, one 9, and one 8. A common conservative opening is to bid on a digit I have at least two of, which gives some confidence and leaves room for escalation. I will start with '3 5s' because I hold two 5s, and it's reasonable to expect at least one more 5 in the opponent's hand.
