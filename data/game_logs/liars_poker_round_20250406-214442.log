Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there has been no bid yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 50561314, I have two 1s, two 0s, two 5s, one 3, one 4, and one 6. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, since I have two 5s myself, making it likely there are at least two total. This is a conservative but solid opening bid.
