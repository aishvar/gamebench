Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (10634865), I have one '0'. The current bid is 1 0s, which is supported by just my hand alone, so it's very likely valid. To increase the bid, the minimal strictly higher bid would be 1 1s. Since I have one '1' in my hand, this is a safe incremental bid that doesn't overcommit and keeps pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have the digits 1, 0, 6, 3, 4, 8, 6, 5. The current bid is 1 2s, meaning at least one '2' in total. I have zero 2s, so the bid is plausible but minimal. Since it's very likely that the opponent has at least one 2 in their 8 digits, challenging now is risky. A safe and strategic move is to increment to the next digit at the same quantity, which is 1 3s, leveraging the fact that I hold one '3' myself. This is a minimal but valid raise.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have the digits 1, 0, 6, 3, 4, 8, 6, 5 in my hand. The current bid is 1 4s. I can see exactly one 4 in my hand, so the bid of 1 4s is plausible. Since the minimum raise is to either 1 5s or 2 4s, and I hold one 5 and no additional 4s, bidding 1 5s is a safe incremental raise that increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This keeps the pressure on my opponent without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digit 6 appears twice. Since the current bid is only 1 6s, and I already hold two, it's very likely there are at least two 6s in total. The minimum higher bid is either 2 0s or 1 7s, but given my strong count of 6s, the safest and most strategic bid is to increase the quantity on 6s to 2. This puts pressure on the opponent while relying on known information.
