Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, and I know I have one myself, it's very likely that at least one 0 exists in total, so challenging now would be unwise. To make a minimal but valid higher bid, I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. The next higher digit would be 1, resulting in a bid of 1 1s.
