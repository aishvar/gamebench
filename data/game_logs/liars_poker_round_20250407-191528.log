Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given it's my turn and the current bid is None, I need to make the first bid. Since I have a 7 in my hand, I can bid on the digit 7. I'll also try to make a relatively high bid to set a strong foundation for future turns. I'll bid Q (quantity 16) on the digit 7.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 'None', I can start by bidding on a digit that is likely to be high in the players' hands. Considering my own hand, I notice I have a '7' and a '5', which are relatively high digits. I will start by bidding on the digit '5', as it is a good starting point and I have a higher chance of winning.
