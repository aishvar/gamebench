Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without risking a challenge. I see I have two 7s and one 9 in my hand. A bid of 2 7s seems reasonable as a starting point, given that I have two 7s and no information about the other player's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have two 6s and four 3s in my hand, but no sevens. Since the quantity is low and I have no sevens, I should aim to increase both the quantity and the digit. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable move, as it's higher than the current bid and takes into account my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more likely to succeed. My hand contains the digits 9, 9, 5, 1, 4, 0, 0, 7. I have no 8s, so I cannot increase the count of 8s. However, I can try to bid higher with a digit I have. The highest digit I can bid on is 9. I have two 9s, and the current bid is 3 8s. I can try to bid 4 9s, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. Given my hand (19368540), I have two 9s. A bid higher than 4 9s must increase either the quantity or the digit. Since 9 is already the highest digit, I must increase the quantity. With two 9s, bidding 5 9s seems reasonable, as it's a small increase from the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have two 9s in my hand, and I know there are 8 secret digits in total for each player. Given that the bid history shows increasing confidence in higher digits, I should consider if I can make a valid higher bid. Since my hand contains two 9s and I know the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. The current bid is 5 9s, so I should either increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 9s, so increasing the quantity seems feasible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I have a 9 in my hand. Given the increasing bid pattern, it's reasonable to assume the previous player's bid was likely based on having a high count of 9s. Since I have a 9, I should increase the quantity or digit to make a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 7 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. I have two 9s in my hand, and I know there are 8 digits in total (4 from each player). Given that the previous bids have already established a high count of 9s, I should consider if I can reasonably challenge or make a higher bid. Since I have two 9s and the bid history shows increasing confidence in 9s, I should assess if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 8 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 9s. I have a 9 in my hand. I can make a reasonable bid by increasing the quantity to 9 9s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 9 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 9s, made by Player 1. Given that I have two 9s in my hand (from the digits 99514007), I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. Since the current bid is 9 9s, I must consider if I can reasonably make a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent. I have two 9s, and if Player 1 has at least 7 more 9s (which is highly unlikely given the limit of 16 digits per player and 8 per hand), then their bid could be valid. However, given that I have no information suggesting they have more than 7 nines, and my hand does not have enough 9s to make 10, I should consider a challenge or a bid that seems more feasible.
