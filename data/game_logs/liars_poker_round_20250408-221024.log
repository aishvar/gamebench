Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 6.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 6s, so challenging 3 6s is risky. However, I do hold one 8, making 3 8s a plausible next bid if the other player has at least two 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 6s in my hand, which makes a bid of 4 6s reasonable. This bid increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid, making it a valid and strategic move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 6s in my hand, so the other player would need all four (or more) 6s in their eight digits. That seems too unlikely, making a challenge the best move.
