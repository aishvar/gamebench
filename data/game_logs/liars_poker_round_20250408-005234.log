Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have one 5 and other digits that could potentially add up if both players have them. A bid of '2 5s' seems reasonable as a starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 5. Since the current bid is 2 5s, there must be at least one more 5 in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. This is quite plausible, so challenging now is risky. To make a safe higher bid, I can look for digits where I have multiple instances to increase the bid confidently. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 3 6s increases the quantity and digit, and is a reasonable, safe next move.

Player 1 bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, and I know there are 16 digits in total. If Player 1 has at least three 6s, my goal is to make a higher bid. Since my hand contains two 6s, bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Player 0 bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (02065963), I have three 6s. The current bid is 4 6s, which implies there is at least one 6 in the opponent's hand. Given that I hold three 6s, it's plausible there is at least one more in their eight digits, making the bid reasonable. Challenging now would be risky. A safe next move is to increase the bid slightly, perhaps to 4 7s, which is a minimal raise and puts pressure back on the opponent.

Player 1 bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 1, 7, 6, 8, 0, 5, 2, 9. I have one 7, so the total count of 7s could be at most 2 (if the other player also has one 7). I should bid higher than 4, or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I have two 6s, bidding 5 6s seems reasonable and increases the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 0 bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 6s (digits: 02065963). The current bid is 5 6s, which would require at least two additional 6s in the opponent's hand. Since the opponent previously bid 4 6s and then raised to 5 6s, it is plausible they have two or more 6s, but it's also quite aggressive. The probability of there being 5 or more 6s across both hands is moderate, but bidding higher would be risky without strong evidence. Challenging now is a reasonable strategy given my 3 known 6s and the opponent's aggressive bidding.
