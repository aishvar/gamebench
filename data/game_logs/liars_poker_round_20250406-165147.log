Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I can make a conservative opening bid. I have two 0s in my hand, so bidding 3 0s seems like a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 48756941, I have zero 0s. Since there are 16 digits total, and I hold none, the probability that the opponent has at least 3 zeros is low but plausible. Rather than challenge now, a safe strategic move is to raise the bid slightly, picking a digit I have some of to maintain flexibility. I have two 4s, so bidding 3 4s (same quantity, higher digit) is a minimal raise and keeps options open.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. I could challenge, but it's early in the game, and 3 is a relatively low quantity. I will raise the bid to 4 0s, since I have two 0s in my hand and the previous bid was 3 0s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 48756941, I have no 0s at all. The opponent's bid is 4 0s, meaning they believe there are at least four zeros across both hands. Since I have zero zeros, that would require the opponent to have all 4 or more zeros in their hand, which is statistically unlikely given only 8 digits. The probability of one player having 4 or more zeros in 8 digits is quite low. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
