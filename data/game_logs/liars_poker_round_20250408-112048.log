Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and it's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 73624834. I have two 3s and two 4s, which are my most frequent digits. The expected number of any digit across all 16 is 1.6. Having two 4s is slightly above average. A reasonable opening bid would be to claim slightly more than I have. Bidding '3 4s' signals some strength in 4s (as I have two) and requires the opponent to have at least one 4, which is statistically plausible (probability is roughly 1 - (0.9)^8 â‰ˆ 57%). It's a better opening bid than '3 3s' because the digit is higher, and safer than bidding 4 of a kind immediately.
