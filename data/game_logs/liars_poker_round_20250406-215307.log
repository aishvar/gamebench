Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s, three 3s, and one 4 in my hand. Since the current bid is 'None', I can make a valid bid. Bidding 2 8s is reasonable given that I have two in my hand and it's a strong starting point. I want to claim my digit while ensuring I have a solid base for future rounds.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I don't have any 8s in my hand. Since the quantity is low, I will increase the quantity and bid a different digit. I have two 5s, so I'll bid 3 5s.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s and three 3s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s, which I believe can be surpassed. I can bid 4 3s, increasing the quantity while using a digit that I have in my hand, making it a reasonable bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. I could bid 5 3s, or I could increase the digit. I'll bid 5 0s. It's a safe increase and doesn't rely on my holding of 3s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, which means there are at least 2 0s. The current bid is 5 0s, which is higher than what I can confirm. However, I can bid 6 0s, which is a valid higher bid that leverages my hand while still being conservative.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 7 0s is a safe increase. Alternatively, I could bid 6 of a higher number. I have two 5s, so I could bid 6 5s. I'll go with the 6 5s since it leverages my hand slightly better.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s, two 3s, and one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 6 5s, which seems high considering I don't have any 5s. I can increase the bid with a higher quantity of a digit I have. I will bid 7 8s, as I know I have two and it's possible others may have more, making it a reasonable bid.
