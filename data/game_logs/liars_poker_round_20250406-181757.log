Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 0 (from the digit 85634624, there's no 0). The bid seems quite low given that there are 16 digits in total. A reasonable next bid should be higher in quantity or digit. Bidding 1 1s is a safe increase in digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 2s. I can see that my hand contains one 2. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have a total of 8 digits and can see one 2, it's possible the total count of 2s is more than 1. However, I should be cautious. Bidding 2 2s seems too aggressive as it doubles the quantity. Instead, I can bid 1 3s, which is a higher digit than 2s with the same quantity, making it a valid and relatively safe bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. The next possible bid should be higher than 1 4s. I can either bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I have a 6 in my hand, bidding 1 6s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit. Alternatively, I could bid 2 of any digit, but that would be a bigger jump. Given the conservative nature of the bids so far, a small increase seems more appropriate.
