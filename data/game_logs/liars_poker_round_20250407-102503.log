Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 49151439, I have no 0s, which makes the current bid of 1 0s plausible but minimal. Since the lowest valid raise is either increasing the digit at the same quantity or increasing the quantity, the next simplest bid is 1 1s. Given the distribution of digits, bidding 1 1s is safe and minimal, and keeps the game progressing without overcommitting.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 49151439, I have no 2s at all. Since the current bid is only 1 2s, it's quite plausible that my opponent has at least one 2, making a challenge risky. A safe and strategic move is to increase the bid slightly by moving to 1 3s, which is a minimal legal raise and keeps pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.
