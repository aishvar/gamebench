Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 6s, two 5s, one 0, and one 7. A conservative but reasonable opening bid would be 2 1s, as I already hold two 1s myself, making this bid safe and putting some pressure on the opponent.
