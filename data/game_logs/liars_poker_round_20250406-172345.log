Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '1 3s' made by Player 0. I need to bid higher or challenge. My hand is 42355762, which contains one '3'. Since there are 2 players and each has 8 digits, the total count of '3's across both hands is at least 1 (the one in my hand) and at most 9 (if the other player has 8 '3's, which is highly unlikely). The current bid '1 3s' is plausible but I should consider the probability of the other player having more '3's. However, given that the bid is very low and I have one '3', I'll consider raising the bid to a slightly higher value rather than challenging immediately.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 3/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '1 3s' made by Player 0. My hand is 42355762, which contains one '3' and other digits. Since there are 2 players and each has 8 digits, the total count of '3's across both hands could be 1 (the '3' in my hand) or more if Player 0 has '3's. To make a higher bid, I need to bid on a quantity higher than 1 or the same quantity with a higher digit. I will analyze the likelihood of '3's in both hands and consider a bid that is likely to be true or challenging to counter for Player 0.
