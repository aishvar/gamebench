Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. My hand contains the digits 7, 9, 2, 1, 5, 3, 6, and 0. I have one 1, so bidding 2 1s is a safe and reasonable starting point, as it increases both quantity and digit from the current bid of 'None'.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s and one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 1s. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable increase in both quantity and digit based on my hand. I could also bid 3 8s, but 3 5s is a safer bet since I have two 5s.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 5s. Since there are only 16 digits in total, it's unlikely there are 3 fives in play. However, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity to 4 for a lower digit that I have more of, such as 2s or 3s. I have two 3s, so bidding 4 3s seems reasonable.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have two 3s in my hand, which makes it unlikely that there are four 3s in total. Challenging seems like the best move, as it's risky for the opponent to have bid so high with only one 3 in their hand.
