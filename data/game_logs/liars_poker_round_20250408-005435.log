Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 1s, one 2, one 3, one 5, and one 6. A safe opening bid would be 2 of a digit I have multiple of, such as 2 7s or 2 1s. I'll choose 2 7s to start with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s and one 0 in my hand, but no 7s. The current bid is 2 7s, which I cannot support since I don't have any 7s. The total possible count of 7s is limited, as there are only 16 digits in play. Given that I have no 7s and the count needed is already 2, it seems unlikely that Player 0 has enough to support their bid. I will challenge the current bid.
