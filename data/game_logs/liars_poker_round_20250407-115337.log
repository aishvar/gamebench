Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s and two 0s, which makes these digits good candidates. An opening bid of 2 8s is both truthful based on my hand and conservative, leaving room for escalation.
