--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand '30678572', I have two 7s, two 3s, two 0s, one 5, one 6, and one 8. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening, I will bid 3 7s, leveraging the fact I already have two 7s myself, making it likely there are at least three in total across all hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 7, 7, 2, 5, 0, 3, 5, and 3. I have two 7s and two 5s, and one 3, and two 2s, and one 0. The maximum possible quantity for any digit across all players' hands is 24. Given that I have two 7s, it's possible that there are at least 3 sevens in total, but I need to consider if bidding higher makes sense or if challenging is more prudent.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. Since I do not have any 7s, I cannot make a bid that increases the digit. However, I can try to bluff and increase the quantity. Bidding 5 4s is a reasonable bluff, as it increases the quantity while using a digit I have in my hand. If challenged, I have a chance of winning if the other players have at least one 4.

Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '30678572', I have one 4. The current bid is 5 4s, meaning there must be at least five 4s across all 24 digits. Since I only have one, the other two players would need to collectively have at least four 4s, which is statistically unlikely. Typically, each digit appears about 2-3 times per player, so having 5 or more 4s total is on the higher end of probability. Given this, challenging is a reasonable move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 2's (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bid of 5 4s.
