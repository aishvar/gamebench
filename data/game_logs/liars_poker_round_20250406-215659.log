Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, and the other player is naive and likely to have a random distribution of digits. Bidding 2 0s is a reasonable increase, as it's likely there is at least one more 0 between both players' hands. If the other player challenges, I have a high chance of winning.
