Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s and two 8s, which are the most frequent digits. Starting with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I will bid 3 6s, assuming the opponent might have at least one 6 as well.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I could bid higher, but it might be a bluff. I don't have enough information to confidently raise the bid. Since the quantity is still relatively low, and I only have one 6, challenging seems risky. I will raise the bid slightly to 4 7s. This is a small increase and forces the other player to consider their hand and the possibility I have multiple 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '19586468', I have two 6s and two 8s but no 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, which means there must be at least four 7s across both hands. Since I have zero 7s, that would require my opponent to have all four or more 7s, which is unlikely given only eight digits. The probability of them having four or more 7s is low, so challenging is a strong move here.
