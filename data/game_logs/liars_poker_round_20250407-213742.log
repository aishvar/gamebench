Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid, so I can bid anything. I'll start with a relatively low bid to gauge the opponent's hand. Bidding 'Q D' (Quantity 1, Digit 0) seems reasonable as a starting point. It's not too aggressive, but it establishes a baseline.

Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid, so I can bid anything. I have two 9s, so bidding 9s seems reasonable. I'll start with a conservative bid of two 9s to test the waters.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s, which already meets the current bid of 2 9s. Since the total count across both hands is at least 2, the current bid is plausible. Raising to 3 9s would require at least one more 9 in Player 0's hand, which is possible but uncertain. A safer strategic move is to increase the bid by quantity or digit without overcommitting. I can bid 2 of a higher digit, such as 2 7s or 2 8s, but since I also have two 7s and one 8, bidding 3 7s is risky. Alternatively, I can bid 3 2s, since I have two 2s, and just one more 2 in their hand would satisfy that bid. This is a safer incremental bid. Therefore, the best move is to bid 3 2s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. My hand contains zero 2s. The opponent bid 3 2s after I bid 2 9s. It's highly unlikely they have three 2s given the previous bid. It is a good opportunity to challenge. If they are lying, I win. If they are telling the truth, I lose, but the risk is worth it given the information available.
