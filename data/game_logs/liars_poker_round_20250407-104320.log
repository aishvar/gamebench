Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: There is no current bid, so I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, which is a strong starting point. An opening bid of 2 8s is reasonable, reflecting my known cards and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9 and two 8s. The current bid is 2 9s, which is plausible since I alone have one 9 and it's likely the opponent has at least one. Making a minimal higher bid is strategically safe. I can increase the quantity to 3 and choose a digit I have good representation of, like 8, since I have two of them. So, bidding 3 8s is a reasonable next move, raising the quantity and reverting to a digit I have strength in.
