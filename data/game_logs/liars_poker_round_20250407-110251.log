Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 6s, one 1, one 8, one 9, and one 5. A conservative yet solid opening bid would be 2 of a digit I have multiple of, such as 2 3s or 2 6s. I will choose 2 6s as my opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable increase, as it maintains the digit and increases the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit, but given I have a 6, sticking with that digit seems sensible. Bidding 2 7s would also be valid, but 3 6s feels slightly safer given my hand.

Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand (digits: 6, 6, 6). The current bid is 3 6s, which matches exactly what I hold, so the opponent must have none or at most very few 6s. Bidding 4 6s would imply there is at least one more 6 in the opponent's hand, which is plausible but risky. Given I already hold three 6s, it's unlikely the total is four or more. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
