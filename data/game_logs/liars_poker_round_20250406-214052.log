Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 70064521, I notice that I have two 0s and other digits that could potentially be in the other player's hand. Since the goal is to make a bid that is reasonable and has a good chance of being true, I'll choose a digit and quantity that seems plausible based on my hand. Bidding on the digit 0 seems like a safe start because I already have two of them, and it's possible the other player could have a few as well.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 86371384, I have no 0s at all. The current bid is 4 0s, which would require the opponent to have at least 4 zeros, or both hands combined to have 4 or more zeros. Since I have zero zeros, the entire count depends solely on the opponent's hand. The probability that the opponent's 8 digits contain 4 or more zeros is quite low (roughly 4 or more zeros in 8 digits, which is unlikely). Therefore, it's a good time to challenge the bid.
