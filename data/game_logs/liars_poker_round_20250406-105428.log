Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. My hand is 45022739. I have eight digits, and the opponent also has eight, for a total of 16 digits. Analyzing my hand, I have one 0, two 2s, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 7, and one 9. The digit I have the most of is 2 (two occurrences). Statistically, across 16 digits, we expect about 1.6 of each digit (16/10). Since I already have two 2s, it's quite likely there is at least one more 2 among the opponent's 8 digits. Therefore, bidding '3 2s' is a reasonable and relatively safe opening bid based on my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 2s in my hand (51104789). The current bid is 3 2s, which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least three 2s in total across both hands. Since I have zero 2s, it's unlikely that Player 0 has three or more 2s in their hand (as the maximum possible in their hand would be 8 digits). Therefore, challenging seems like the best move.
