--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None' and this is the first bid, I can start with any digit and quantity. Considering my hand, I have two 6's, which is a reasonable starting point. Bidding 2 6's is a safe and strategic move to begin the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 sixes. In my hand (85370573), I have zero sixes. Since I hold none, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must hold both sixes. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely as two sixes in one hand is not common, but certainly within probability. Given that the bid is relatively conservative (only 2), challenging it now is risky. Instead, I can safely raise the bid slightly. The next valid minimum bid is 2 7s (since I have two 7s in my hand), which is a safe incremental bid that leverages my hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. My hand contains 0 sevens, so the maximum possible total sevens across both hands is 2 (if Player 1 has 2 sevens). Since Player 1 bid 2 7s, they likely have 2 sevens. I cannot bid higher than 2 7s for any digit, but I can challenge the bid as I believe it's already at the maximum possible.
