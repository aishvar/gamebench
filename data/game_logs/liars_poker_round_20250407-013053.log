Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 7, one 5, one 6, one 9, one 1, one 0, one 2, and one 5. Notably, I have two 5s, which is the highest count of any digit in my hand. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, as it's supported entirely by my own hand and does not overcommit early.
