Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player, I need to make an initial bid. My hand contains two 1s, which is the highest count of any single digit. Bidding 2 1s is a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have one 1 in my hand (since my hand is 83849502 and it contains one 1, which is not directly visible but upon inspection, there's no 1). Given that I don't have any 1s, the total count of 1s across both hands is solely dependent on Player 0's hand. Since Player 0 bid 2 1s, they must have at least two 1s. I need to either challenge or make a higher bid. A reasonable higher bid would be to increase the quantity or the digit. I can see I have some digits, and I can try to bid on a digit I have. I have two 8s and one 5 and other digits, so bidding on 8s could be a good strategy as I have two 8s. However, I should start with a conservative bid. Bidding 2 8s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and keeps the quantity the same, making it a valid bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s, and I have one 8 in my hand. The total number of 8s across both hands could be 1 or 2. Since the bid is 2 8s, challenging it could be advantageous if Player 1 does not have any 8s, resulting in a total of 1, which would make the bid invalid. Given the uncertainty about Player 1's hand, challenging seems like a strategic move.
