--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand, and the current bid is 1 2s. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 2, increasing the quantity is not feasible. Therefore, I will bid 1 3s, increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 3s. I don't have any 3s, but the bid is very low. I can safely increase the bid to 2 4s, as it's still a conservative bid and increases both the quantity and the digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 2 4s. Since I don't have any 4s, I can't confidently increase the quantity of 4s. However, I can bid on a higher digit with a quantity of 2, such as 2 5s, which is a valid higher bid based on the rules.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. I could raise the bid to 3 5s, or I could bid a different digit. Since I have two 9s, bidding 3 9s seems like a reasonable and safe move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 9s. Given the aggressive bidding history, it's unlikely there are 3 or more 9s in total. Challenging seems like the best move.
