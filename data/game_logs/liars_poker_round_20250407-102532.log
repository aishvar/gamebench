Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, one 1, one 5, one 8, one 4, one 9, and one 5. The most frequent digit in my hand is 0 with two occurrences. A reasonable opening bid is 2 0s, reflecting my hand's strength and leaving room to increase later.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I see two 0s, one 1, and other digits. The current bid is 2 1s. Since I have one 1, for the bid of 2 1s to be valid, the opponent must have at least one 1, which is reasonable. To outbid, I can raise the digit or the quantity. Bidding 3 0s seems plausible since I already have two 0s, and it's likely the opponent has at least one more zero among their eight digits. Therefore, I will bid 3 0s, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 0s

Calculating action for Player 1 (Naive 50/50)
Player 1 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 1s
Player 1 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s and zero 1s. The current bid is 3 1s, which implies there must be at least three 1s across both hands. Since I hold none, all three would need to be in Player 1's hand. Given that Player 1 only has eight digits, it's unlikely they have three or more 1s, especially since they previously only increased the bid from 2 1s to 3 1s. The probability favors that they do not have three 1s, so challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
