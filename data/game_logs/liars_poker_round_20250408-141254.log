Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, one 0, one 4, one 6, one 9, one 7, and one 5. A conservative but reasonable opening bid is 2 2s, reflecting what I hold, which is a safe minimum and puts some pressure on the opponent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 2s, zero 3s, and a mix of other digits. The current bid is 2 3s, which is plausible since I have none but there could be two or more in Player 1's hand. Challenging now is risky. To safely overbid, I can bid 2 4s since I have one 4, making it plausible there are at least two 4s across both hands. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity by bidding 3 2s, given I already hold two 2s, so needing just one more from Player 1's hand, which is reasonable. Therefore, the best strategic move is to bid 3 2s, raising the quantity while relying on my strong holding of 2s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 2s and zero 3s. The current bid is 3 3s, which I find unlikely because I hold none, so all three 3s would need to be in Player 1's hand. This is improbable given only 8 digits. Since I have two 2s, bidding 3 4s or 4 2s would be riskier than challenging. Therefore, I will challenge the current bid of 3 3s.
