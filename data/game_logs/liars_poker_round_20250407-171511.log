Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: For my opening bid, I should analyze my hand and make a strategic initial bid. In my hand, I have one '0', one '2', one '3', one '4', one '7', one '8', and one '9'. Since I know there are 8 digits in each player's hand (16 total), I should bid conservatively but not too low. I see one '0' in my hand, and it's reasonable to expect at least one more '0' in the opponent's hand. Making a bid of 2 zeros is a safe opening move - it's conservative enough to be likely true while still forcing my opponent to make meaningful decisions.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (47902965), I have 0 zeros. The current bid is '2 0s', which means my opponent is claiming there are at least 2 zeros total between our hands. Since I have 0 zeros, this means my opponent would need to have at least 2 zeros in their hand for this bid to be valid. This is certainly possible, as zeros are fairly common digits. I could challenge, but it's risky since the bid is quite low and reasonable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have one 9 in my hand, so I'll bid '2 9s', which is higher than '2 0s' because the digit is higher. This is a strategic move because 9 is less common than lower digits, so there's a decent chance my opponent doesn't have any 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I can see my entire hand (70924830) which contains 0 nines. For the current bid of '2 9s' to be valid, Player 1 would need to have at least 2 nines in their hand since I have none. While this is possible, there's only a 16.7% chance of any given digit being a 9, and Player 1 would need at least 2 of them. Additionally, Player 1 made this bid immediately after my conservative opening bid, which might suggest a bluff. Given these factors, challenging is the safer option than making a higher bid.
