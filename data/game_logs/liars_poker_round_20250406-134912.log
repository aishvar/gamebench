Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. I'll start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s and two 5s. A bid of 2 5s or 2 6s seems reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 5s, so for the current bid of 2 5s to be true, the opponent must have at least 2 of them, which is plausible but uncertain. However, I have two 9s in my hand, making a bid of 3 9s quite reasonable since the opponent only needs to have one 9 for that bid to be valid. This is a safer and stronger bid than challenging now.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains a 6, a 5, and several other digits, but no 9s. I can see if I can make a reasonable bid based on my hand and the bidding history. The bid history shows that there are at least 3 9s in total. Since my hand does not have any 9s, I will try to bid higher with a digit I have. I have two 5s and the current bid does not include any 5s. I can try to bid with a higher quantity or a higher digit. A reasonable bid seems to be 4 5s because I have two 5s and it seems unlikely that the opponent has more than one 5.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s and one 5. The current bid is 4 5s. Since I only have one 5, for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least three 5s, which is possible but somewhat unlikely given typical digit distribution. However, I have two 9s, and the previous bid was already 3 9s. Bidding 4 9s would increase the quantity while leveraging my strong count of 9s. This is a safer and strategic move rather than challenging now.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I need to make a higher bid than 4 9s. My hand contains the digits 5, 3, 8, 0, 2, 2, 1, 6. I have two 2s, which could be useful. However, I should consider if there's a higher digit that I can bid on with a reasonable quantity. Since my hand doesn't have many high digits, I should focus on increasing the quantity while choosing a digit that I know exists. The current highest bid is 4 9s, so I need to bid higher than this. I can bid 5 0s as I have one 0, increasing the quantity seems more feasible than increasing the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 4, but no 0s. The current bid is 5 0s, which requires at least five zeros across both hands. Since I have zero zeros, the entire count depends on Player 0's hand. It's highly improbable that Player 0 has all five or more zeros in their hand of eight digits. Given the low likelihood of five or more zeros total, challenging is the best strategic move.
