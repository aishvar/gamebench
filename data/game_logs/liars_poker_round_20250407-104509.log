Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 7s, one 1, one 2, one 4, and one 9. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 7s, reflecting my two 7s, which is neither too conservative nor too aggressive.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 8s but two 7s. The current bid is 2 8s, which is plausible but uncertain without any 8s on my side. Since raising the bid is safer than challenging a reasonable bid, I can increase the quantity to 3, choosing a digit I have some information about. I have two 7s, so bidding 3 7s is a logical, safe progression that is likely to be true.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s and zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, which would require at least three 8s across both hands. Since I have none, Player 1 would need to have all three 8s, which is unlikely given a random distribution. The probability of them holding three 8s is low, so challenging is the optimal move.
