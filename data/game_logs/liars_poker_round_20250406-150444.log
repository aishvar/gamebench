Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game, so I want to start with a conservative and statistically reasonable bid. My hand contains two 7s, two 0s, two 4s, one 5, one 2, one 6, and one 1. Given that there are 16 digits total, starting with a bid of 3 7s is safe because I already hold two 7s, making it plausible that there is at least one more 7 in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 and one 8 in my hand (84928348). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have an 8, I can bid 3 8s, which is a higher digit than 7 and within my hand's information.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 74750261, I have no 8s, which makes the current bid of 3 8s somewhat risky. Since I hold zero 8s, all three or more 8s would have to be in the opponent's hand, which is unlikely. The expected number of 8s in 16 digits is roughly 1.6, so 3 is already on the high side. Therefore, challenging the bid is the optimal move.
