Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (Random(openrouter/cohere/command-a:floor)), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I can start with any valid bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s. Assuming the opponent might have at least one 7, a reasonable starting bid would be 3 sevens. This is a safe and strategic opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. My hand is 20591636, which contains zero 7s. For the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least three 7s in their 8-digit hand. Assuming digits are uniformly distributed, the probability of a single player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is low (approximately P(X>=3) for Binomial(n=8, p=0.1) which is about 3.8%). Since I have confirmed zero 7s, the probability of the bid being valid rests entirely on the opponent's hand, making it highly unlikely. Therefore, challenging the bid is the statistically sound move.
