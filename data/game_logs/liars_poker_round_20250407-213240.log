Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 49419507, the counts are: 0(1), 1(1), 4(2), 5(1), 7(1), 9(2). The most frequent digits are 4 and 9, each appearing twice. To start conservatively yet assertively, I will bid 2 of 9s, as I hold two 9s, and it's a strong opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. My hand contains 1 nine. To challenge, I need to believe the total number of 9s is less than 2. The opponent has 8 unknown digits. The probability they have zero 9s is ~43% (calculated as (9/10)^8). This creates a reasonable chance the bid is invalid. Bidding higher (e.g., 3 9s) is riskier since the probability of the opponent having â‰¥2 9s is low (~19%). Challenging offers a 43% chance of winning immediately.
