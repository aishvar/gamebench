Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 2, two 6s, two 7s, one 8, and one 9. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 6s, reflecting the two 6s I hold, which also sets a solid baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s. Bidding 2 7s is a valid higher bid since 7 is greater than 6. This leverages my hand's strength without overcommitting.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '16872963', I have two 7s. Since the current bid is 2 7s and I already hold both, it's plausible the total is at least 2, but unlikely there are significantly more. To outbid, the minimal valid bid is 2 8s. Given I have one 8, it's reasonable to assume there might be one more 8 in the opponent's hand, making 2 8s a safe incremental bid. Challenging 2 7s is risky because I hold both 7s myself, so the bid is likely valid.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 8s. Bidding 3 7s is a higher quantity, which is a valid bid. Since I have two 7s, if Player 0 has at least one, the total will be three, making my bid valid. This seems like a reasonable move based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s (digits: 1,6,8,7,2,9,6,3). The current bid is 3 7s, which requires at least one more 7 in the opponent's hand to be valid. Since having at least three 7s total is plausible and not unlikely, challenging now is risky. To raise, the minimal valid bid would be 3 8s or 4 7s. I only have one 8, so betting 3 8s is less supported by my hand. Betting 4 7s requires assuming the opponent has at least two 7s, which is unlikely. Therefore, the best strategic move is to challenge the current bid.
