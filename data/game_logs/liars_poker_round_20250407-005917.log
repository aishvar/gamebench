Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so any valid bid is acceptable. I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 1 3s is a safe opening bid, as it's based on cards I know exist. It's a low bid, but it establishes a starting point without revealing too much information.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 3s. I have zero 3s in my hand (98062465). For the bid to be true, the opponent must have at least one 3. This is statistically likely given they have 8 digits, so challenging is risky. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 6s, which is my most frequent digit. Bidding '2 6s' is a safe bid because I personally hold two 6s. This bid is higher than '1 3s' (increases quantity) and leverages the information from my hand effectively.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I can either increase the quantity of 6s or bid on a different digit. Increasing the quantity to 3 6s is a reasonable option, as it's a small increase and I have a 6. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, such as 3s (I have two). However, given the previous bid of 1 3s, increasing to 2 or 3 3s feels less strategic than increasing the 6s bid. Bidding 3 6s feels like a good balance between increasing the bid and leveraging my hand.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 6s

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 98062465, containing two 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, made by Player 0 after I bid 2 6s. This means Player 0 claims there are at least three 6s in total across both hands. Since I have two 6s, their bid is true if they have one or more 6s. Challenging is risky because Player 0 raised my bid on 6s, suggesting they likely hold at least one 6. Bidding higher is the alternative. The next possible bids are '3 7s', '3 8s', '3 9s', or '4 0s' and up. Bidding '4 6s' leverages my holding of two 6s. This bid requires Player 0 to have at least two 6s for it to be true. While statistically not highly probable (around 19% chance for an opponent to have >=2 of a specific digit), Player 0's raise to '3 6s' makes it more plausible they might hold more than zero 6s. Bidding '4 6s' puts pressure back on Player 0 and is a direct escalation based on my hand strength in 6s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 6s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit to 7 seems reasonable as it's a possible outcome, and I have no information to suggest it's unlikely. Bidding 5 7s is a valid and plausible bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have zero 7s in my hand (98062465). For the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least five 7s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of one player having five or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is very low, especially when I hold none of that digit. The bid history shows escalation on 6s before Player 0 jumped to 5 7s, which could indicate a bluff. Given the statistical improbability, challenging is the best course of action.
