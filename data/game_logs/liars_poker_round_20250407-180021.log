Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 91552647. I have two 5s, which is the highest frequency of any digit in my hand. There are 16 total digits in play (2 players * 8 digits). The expected number of any specific digit is 1.6 (16 * 0.1). Since I have two 5s, bidding 'Two 5s' is a truthful and relatively safe opening bid. It leverages the strongest part of my hand and sets a reasonable starting point for the bidding.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 5s'. I need to analyze my hand and determine if I can make a valid higher bid or if I should challenge. My hand contains the digits: 8, 8, 2, 1, 4, 7, 8, 0. I have a total of 3 '8's, 1 '2', 1 '1', 1 '4', 1 '7', and 1 '0'. Since the bid is on the count of '5's and I do not have any '5's in my hand, I can only rely on the information from my hand to make a decision. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and since there are only 2 players, the current bid of '2 5s' could potentially be valid or not, depending on Player 0's hand. However, I can see if I can make a higher bid with a digit I have. I have 3 '8's which is more than the current bid of 2 '5's. Thus, I can make a bid of '3 8s' which would be higher than '2 5s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 91552647. The current bid is '3 8s'. I have zero 8s in my hand. For the bid to be true, the other player (Player 1) must have at least three 8s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a single player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand (assuming uniform random distribution) is relatively low (approximately 3.8%). Since I hold none of the bid digit, the likelihood of the current bid being true is very small. Therefore, challenging the bid is the statistically advantageous move.
