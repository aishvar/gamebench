Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid, I can bid any quantity of any digit. I will start with a conservative bid of 1 Queen (Q). This allows me to gather information about Player 1's hand without risking a challenge too early. It's a safe opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since it's the first bid, I should make a reasonable starting bid. I have two 2s, two 8s, and one each of 0, 4, 6, 7, and 9. Bidding 'Q D' (Quantity 1, Digit 2) seems like a safe opening bid. It's unlikely my opponent has a very high count of 2s, and it doesn't reveal too much about my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 2s. In my hand, there are no 2s. Since the maximum possible 2s across both hands is 2 (if the other player has 2 2s), the bid of 1 2s is plausible but not necessarily high. However, I cannot bid higher on 2s since I have none, and bidding on a different digit would not directly challenge the current bid. Therefore, I will challenge the bid as I believe it might be exaggerated given the low probability of the other player having 2 2s.
