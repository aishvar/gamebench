Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start by bidding a quantity and digit I have. Bidding 2 6s is a safe and reasonable starting point based on my hand, and it's a higher digit which could be advantageous.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (61945278), so the total count of 6s so far is at least 2 (one from my hand and at least one from the opponent's hand). I can either challenge or make a higher bid. A higher bid can be made by either increasing the quantity or keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit. Since I see one 6 in my hand, bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 6s. Since I have two, the total could be 3 if Player 1 has one or 2 if they have none. Challenging is a good move because it's uncertain whether Player 1 is bluffing or not, and the potential reward outweighs the risk.
