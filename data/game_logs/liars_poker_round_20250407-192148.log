Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there has not been any bid yet, I must open the bidding. Typically, the safest opening bid is on a digit I have multiple copies of in my hand. Looking at my hand '42567180', I have one of each digit except for '0', which I have one, and '2', which I have one. Since no digit repeats, I will start with a conservative opening bid of 2 of a common digit like '1' or '0'. Given that '0' is common in many hands and psychologically comfortable as an opener, I will bid 2 zeros.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 zeros. Looking at my hand (91705684), I have 1 zero. For the bid to be valid, there must be at least 2 zeros between both hands. Since I have 1 zero, Player 0 would only need to have at least 1 zero to make the bid truthful. The probability that Player 0 has at least 1 zero in their 8 digits is quite high, as the chance of having no zeros at all is (9/10)^8 â‰ˆ 43%, meaning a 57% chance they have at least one zero. This makes the bid plausible, so challenging now is risky. The minimal safe move is to increase the bid slightly. The smallest valid raise is '2 1s', since the digit increases and the quantity remains the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. Looking at my hand '42567180', I have zero 1s. Since I have none, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have both 1s in their hand. This is somewhat unlikely, as the chance they hold two or more 1s is relatively low (roughly 14% assuming uniform distribution). Given that, challenging is a good strategic move here because the bid is probably an overstatement.
