--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s, two 5s, and two 9s in my hand. Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a moderate bid based on my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a safe starting point as I already have two 5s, and it's likely the opponent has at least one more.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid because 7 is a higher digit than 5, and I have two 7s, making it plausible that the total could be at least three.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s, one 5, one 0, two 6s, one 9, and one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. Since I don't have any 7s, it's unlikely that there are at least three 7s in total (since the other player would need to have three 7s). Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
