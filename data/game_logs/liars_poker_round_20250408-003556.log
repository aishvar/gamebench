Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, making it a safe bet to bid on at least two 5s. This is a reasonable starting bid as it's guaranteed to be true based on my hand, and it's a solid foundation for the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s. I could bid 3 5s, but that's risky as it relies on the other player having at least one 5. I could bid a higher digit with a quantity of 2. I have one 8, so bidding 2 8s is a reasonable option. Alternatively, I could bid 3 0s. I have two 0s, so that's also possible, but 8s feels safer given the limited information. Since I want to avoid a challenge if possible, I'll increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, so if the other player has none, the bid of 2 8s is false. Challenging is a good move because the risk of the bid being correct is moderate, and I don't have enough information to safely make a higher bid.
