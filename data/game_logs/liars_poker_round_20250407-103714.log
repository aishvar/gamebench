Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s. Since the current bid is 1 0s and I alone have two, it's safe to increase the bid on 0s. A natural next move is to bid 2 0s, which is a strictly higher bid and well-supported by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 0, 4, 3, 3, 5, 9, 7, 0. I have two 0s, zero 1s, two 3s, one 4, one 5, one 7, and one 9. The current bid is 2 1s, but I have no 1s, so I can't confidently increase the bid on 1s. However, since I hold two 0s myself, it's likely there are at least three 0s in total between both players. Therefore, a natural higher bid is 3 0s, increasing the quantity and reverting to a digit I have strong evidence for.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 0s

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one '1'. The current bid is 3 1s, which means there must be at least three '1's across both hands. Since I only have one, Player 0 would need at least two '1's for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution of digits and the prior bids shifting from 0s to 1s, it's unlikely Player 0 has two or more '1's, especially since they previously bid on 0s. Therefore, I believe the current bid is an overestimate and challenging is the best move.
