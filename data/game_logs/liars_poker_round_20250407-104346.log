Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 75839417, I have two 7s, two 1s, and one each of 5, 8, 3, 9, and 4. A safe opening bid would be 2 of a digit I have multiple copies of, such as 2 7s or 2 1s. Choosing 2 7s utilizes the fact I have two 7s and is a reasonable conservative opening bid.
