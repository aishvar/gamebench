Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must open the bidding. The most common digit in my hand is '1', which appears twice. A typical conservative opening bid is 2 of a digit I hold multiple times, as it's likely there are more in the opponent's hand. Therefore, I will start with a bid of 2 ones.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have one '1' in my hand. My opponent could have up to 7 '1's. Therefore, a total of up to 8 '1's could exist. Bidding '3 1s' is plausible. I'll bid higher to test the waters and potentially force a challenge if my opponent doesn't have the cards to support a higher count. Bidding 'Q D' is invalid, so I must bid in the correct format.

Player 1 bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 ones. Looking at my hand (4,8,5,9,3,1,6,1), I have two 1s. For the total to be at least 3, the opponent needs to have at least one 1 in their hand of 8 digits. This is reasonably likely, so challenging now is risky. Instead, I can increase the bid conservatively. The next valid bids would be 3 2s or 4 1s. Since I have no 2s, bidding 3 2s is risky. Bidding 4 1s would require the opponent to have at least two 1s, which is less probable, so it's better to avoid that. Alternatively, I can bid 3 3s, since I have one 3, but that requires the opponent to have at least two 3s, which is unlikely. The safest is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity at 3, so I will bid 3 4s. I have one 4, so the opponent would need two 4s, which is plausible. This is a reasonable incremental bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have two 4s in my hand (61454233). Player 0 bid 3 4s after bidding 2 1s and Player 1 bid 3 1s. It's possible Player 0 has more 4s, but it's also likely they are bluffing. I can reasonably bid higher. Bidding 4 4s is a logical next step, as it increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same. Since the maximum quantity is 16, and we're only at 3, there's room to increase the bid. A challenge feels premature at this stage.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have two 4s in my hand. My opponent has bid up from 2 1s to 3 1s and then to 3 4s. This suggests they might have a few 4s themselves, but it's also possible they are bluffing. I can safely bid higher without revealing much information about my hand. Bidding '4 4s' is a reasonable increase and doesn't feel overly risky.

Player 1 bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. Looking at my hand (4 8 5 9 3 1 6 1), I have one '4'. Since there are two players with 8 digits each, the total digits are 16. To justify a bid of 4 4s, there must be at least 3 more '4's in Player 1's hand, which is somewhat unlikely given the distribution of digits. While possible, four of the same digit is already a relatively high count, especially since I only hold one. Therefore, the probability that the total number of 4s is 4 or more is low enough to warrant a challenge rather than risking a higher bid.
