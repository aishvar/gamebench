Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 33726249, the digit '3' appears twice, '2' appears twice, '6', '4', '7', and '9' each appear once. A good opening strategy is to bid conservatively on a digit I have multiple of, maximizing the chance that at least one matching digit is in the opponent's hand. Therefore, I will open with a bid of 2 threes, as I already hold two 3s myself, making this a safe and reasonable opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Let me analyze this carefully: 1) I have zero 3s in my hand (64120710). 2) The opponent claims there are at least 2 threes total. 3) Since I have none, this means the opponent would need to have at least 2 threes in their hand. 4) While this is possible, I can see that making a higher bid would be risky since I have no 3s to contribute. 5) For any higher bid, I'd be relying entirely on the opponent's hand. 6) With 8 digits per player, having 2 of any number in one hand is plausible but not guaranteed. 7) Given I have zero 3s, I think challenging is the safer play than trying to bid higher.
