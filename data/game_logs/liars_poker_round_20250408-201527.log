--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game, so I should make a safe and reasonable opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 3s, and one each of 1, 2, 7, and 8. Since I have two 5s, a bid of 3 5s is conservative and likely to be valid, considering the opponent probably has at least one 5 as well. This sets a solid starting point without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 38155273, I have no 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, which requires at least three 6s across both hands. Since I have zero, all three would need to be in Player 1's hand, which is unlikely. The naive player might overbid, so challenging now is statistically favorable.
