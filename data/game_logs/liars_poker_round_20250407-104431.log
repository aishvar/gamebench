Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, and I know I have at least one, it's quite likely that there could be more zeros in Player 0's hand. To safely increase the bid, I can raise the digit while keeping the quantity the same, or increase the quantity. Given the early stage and the low bid, a conservative but valid higher bid is 1 1s since I also have two 1s. This keeps the bid minimal while progressing the game.
