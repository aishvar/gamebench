Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is 1 0s, and I personally hold one 0, it is quite likely that there is at least one 0 in total, making the current bid safe. To increase the bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. The safest minimal raise is to bid 1 1s. I have one 1 in my hand, so bidding 1 1s is reasonable, as there is at least one 1 in total. This also minimally advances the game without overcommitting.
