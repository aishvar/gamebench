Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and it's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 03884276, which contains two 8s. This is the most frequent digit in my hand. With 16 total digits in play (8 for me, 8 for the opponent), the expected number of any digit is 1.6. Having two 8s is above average. Bidding '3 8s' requires the opponent to have at least one 8 among their 8 digits. This is statistically plausible (approximately a 57% chance). Therefore, '3 8s' is a reasonable opening bid based on my hand, asserting some strength in the digit 8 without being overly aggressive.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand, allowing me to bid 3 9s, which is a higher digit than the current bid of 3 8s. Since the total number of 9s is guaranteed to be at least 3, this bid is valid and safe.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand (03884276). For the bid to be true, the opponent must hold at least three 9s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having 3 or more of a specific digit in an 8-card hand is relatively low (approximately 3.8% based on binomial probability B(8, 0.1)). Given I have none, the likelihood of the total count being 3 or more is very small. Challenging seems statistically advantageous compared to making a higher bid like 4 0s, which would require the opponent to have at least three 0s (also unlikely).
