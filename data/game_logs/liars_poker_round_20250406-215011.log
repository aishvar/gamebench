Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make a valid initial bid. I have two 0s, two 4s, and one 6 in my hand. I can start with a bid of 2 0s, which is reasonable given my hand and the current state of the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2. I have zero 0s. Since the current bid is 2 0s, this would require the opponent to have at least two 0s, which is somewhat plausible but not guaranteed. However, bidding 2 1s is a safe minimal raise because I have two 1s myself, making that bid certainly true. This is a safe way to increase the bid without overcommitting.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s and two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 2 1s. I can increase the quantity while keeping the digit the same, or I can bid a higher digit. Since I have two 0s, I can bid 3 0s. This is a valid higher bid based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '21413382', I have zero 0s. The current bid is 3 0s. Since I have none, I would rely entirely on the opponent having all three 0s, which is unlikely given they only have 8 digits. The probability that one player has 3 or more of a specific digit is low. Therefore, challenging is a strong move here.
