Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make an initial bid. I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding a small quantity of 0s seems like a safe starting point.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 2 0s

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I need to either challenge it or make a higher bid. My hand is 47192587, which contains no 0s. The bid of 2 0s seems high given I have no 0s, but it's possible the other player has more than two 0s since there are 8 digits per player. I will increase the bid to 2 1s, as it's a higher digit and I have one 1 in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. I could bid higher on 1s, or bid on a different number. I also have two 0s. Since the previous bid was 2 0s, I will bid 3 0s to increase the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 47192587, which contains no 0s. The total count of 0s across both hands is at least 3 (since the current bid is 3 0s). I should bid on a higher digit or increase the quantity. I have one 7 and no other high digits, so bidding 4 7s seems like a reasonable increase in both quantity and digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I don't have any 7s in my hand. The bid seems somewhat high, but not impossible. I will raise the bid to 5 0s, since I have two 0s in my hand and the bid must be higher than 4 7s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have the digits 47192587, which means I have no 0s. Given that there are 8 digits per player and 2 players, there are a total of 16 digits. The bid of 5 0s implies that the other player has at least 5 0s. It's possible but seems a bit high. I should analyze my hand to make a reasonable next bid. I have a 7, so the previous bid of 4 7s is relevant. I can increase the quantity or digit. Bidding 5 7s or 4 8s would be a valid higher bid. Since I don't have any 8s, bidding 4 8s might be too risky. Bidding 5 7s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. The maximum number of 7s possible is 16. 5 7s seems plausible, but I can bid higher to try and push the other player to challenge. I will bid 6 7s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 7S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have two 7s in my hand (47192587), so I know there are at least 2 7s. The total number of 7s across both hands must be at least 2 and at most 16. Bidding 7 7s is a reasonable increase in quantity. I can make a higher bid by either increasing the quantity or keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit. Since I have information about the 7s, I'll increase the quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 7 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. Bidding higher on 7s seems risky. However, I also don't have a strong feeling that 7 7s is an unreasonable bid given there are 16 digits total. I will bid slightly higher to probe the other player. I will bid 8 0s, as I have two 0s in my hand and the bid is higher than 7 7s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 8 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 0s. My hand is 47192587, which contains no 0s. The bid history shows an oscillation between 0s and 7s, with Player 0 increasingly confident in 0s. Given that I have no 0s and there are 8 digits in my hand, there are 8 digits left in Player 0's hand. For the bid of 8 0s to be true, Player 0 must have all 8 0s in their hand, which is possible but seems unlikely. However, challenging without a clear alternative bid or strong evidence in my hand is risky. I should consider a bid that is higher than 8 0s. The next possible bid is either 8 1s or 9 0s. Since my hand has one 1 and no 0s, and considering the previous bids, bidding 9 0s seems too aggressive. Bidding 8 1s is a safer option as it matches the quantity but increases the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 8 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. It's possible there are at least eight 1s in total, but it's also possible the other player is bluffing. Since the bid is already quite high, I will make a slightly higher bid to test the waters. I'll bid 9 0s, as I have two 0s in my hand.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 9 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 0s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. Since the maximum quantity is 16 and there are 16 digits in total across both players, bidding 9 1s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit. However, I should first analyze my hand to see if I have any 1s. My hand is 47192587, which contains one 7 and other digits but no 1s. Despite not having a 1, the bid of 9 1s is still plausible because it could be that the other player has multiple 1s. Given the history, Player 0 has been alternating between 0s and higher digits, suggesting they might have a strong hand in 0s or are bluffing. I will bid 9 1s as it's a higher digit than 0 and maintains the same quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Bidding 10 0s seems like a safer move than challenging, as it is only incrementally higher. There have been a lot of 0s bid previously so it is possible there are more than I expect.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 10 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 0s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since the maximum quantity is 16 and there are 16 digits in total (8 per player), bidding 10 1s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit. However, I should analyze my hand to see if I have any 1s. My hand is 47192587, which contains one 7 and other unique digits but no 1s. Despite not having 1s, the bid of 10 1s is still a relatively safe bid because it's likely that the other player has some 1s, and the total count across both hands could easily be 10 or more. Therefore, I will bid 10 1s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Bidding higher on 1s seems risky. I could bid 11 0s, but that's only slightly better. Given the history and the number of bids already made, it's getting less likely that the bid is accurate. I will challenge.
