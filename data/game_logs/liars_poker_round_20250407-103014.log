Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 95270342, I have one 0. The current bid is 1 0s, which is plausible. Since I hold one 0 myself, and knowing the opponent has 8 digits, it's very likely there could be at least one more 0, making a bid of 2 0s quite reasonable. Increasing the quantity by one is a safe and strategic next move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 9, 5, 2, 7, 0, 3, 4, 2. I have zero 1s, so the current bid of 2 1s relies entirely on Player 0's hand containing at least two 1s, which is statistically unlikely given typical digit distribution. Since I have none, it's a good opportunity to challenge the plausibility of the bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
