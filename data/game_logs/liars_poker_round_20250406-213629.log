Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have no 1s in my hand, so the total number of 1s is entirely dependent on Player 0's hand. Since the bid is relatively low and I have zero 1s, challenging this bid could be a good strategy to test if Player 0 has at least two 1s.
