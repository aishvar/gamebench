Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning there's no existing bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 39688784. I see that there are two 8s and one 7, 6, 4, 3. A reasonable starting bid could be on the digit that appears most frequently in my hand or a digit that I think is likely to appear in others' hands. I have two 8s, so bidding on 8s seems like a good start. I'll bid 3 8s, assuming that there might be at least one more 8 across the other players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which is relatively low. Given that there are 4 players with 8 digits each, it's plausible that there are at least 3 8s in total. To make a higher bid, I can increase the quantity to 4 8s, which is still reasonable but slightly more aggressive.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is the better option. My hand contains the digits 2, 9, 2, 8, 5, 2, 8, 3. I have two 8s and two 2s, and two other digits but no other 8s or higher quantity of any single digit than 2. The maximum possible quantity for any digit across all players is 32, but given that there are 8 digits per player and 4 players, the total possible count for any single digit could be up to 32. Since the current bid is 4 8s, and I have two 8s, I should consider if I can reasonably make a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand 83051467, I have one 8. Given there are 32 digits total, the expected average number of 8s across all hands is roughly 3.2. The current bid is 5 8s, which is significantly above the average. Since I only hold one 8, for the bid to be valid, the other three players would need to collectively hold at least 4 more 8s, which is unlikely. Therefore, challenging is the best strategic move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
