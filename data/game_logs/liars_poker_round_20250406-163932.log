Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains the digits 8, 3, 2, 0, 6, 7, 6, and 2. I see that I have two 6s and two 2s. The highest digit in my hand is 8 and the highest quantity of a single digit I can confidently bid on is 2. I will start with a conservative bid that is likely to be valid but also leaves room for others to have the same digit.

Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. Bidding 2 7s increases the digit to a higher value while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. I have one 7 in my hand, so there's a plausible chance the opponent has at least one 7 to meet the bid, making it a strategic move to push the bid higher without requiring a large quantity increase.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 6s, and I can see that bidding a higher quantity or digit could be advantageous. Since I have two 6s, I can confidently bid on this digit. I will increase the quantity to 3 and keep the digit as 6, making it 3 6s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. My hand has 0 6s, so the total count depends solely on Player 0's hand. With only 8 digits in their hand, having 3 or more 6s is statistically unlikely (probability ~0.00008). Challenging is the optimal play to force a likely win if their hand doesn't meet the bid.
