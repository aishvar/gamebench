Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, so the likelihood that there is exactly one 0 across both hands is plausible, but not guaranteed. Since the current bid is very low, it is strategically better to increase the bid rather than challenge immediately. I will increase the quantity to 2 and select a digit I have multiple of, to strengthen my position. I have two 7s, so bidding 2 7s is a safe and valid higher bid.
