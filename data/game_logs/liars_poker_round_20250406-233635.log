Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can safely bid 2 8s. This bid is guaranteed to be valid because my own hand already contains two 8s, making the total count at least two regardless of the opponent's hand. Starting with this low-risk bid forces the opponent to respond while minimizing immediate challenge risk.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains no 8s, making the current bid of 2 8s plausible but uncertain. Since there are 8 unknown digits in Player 0's hand, it's quite possible they have 2 or more 8s. Challenging now has a high risk of losing. Instead, I should make a safe, minimal higher bid. I have two 3s in my hand, so bidding 2 9s (same quantity, higher digit) is reasonable and keeps the pressure on without overcommitting.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 9S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 and two 8s. The current bid is 2 9s. Since 9 is the highest digit, the only way to bid higher is to increase the quantity. Bidding 3 8s leverages my two 8s while maintaining plausible deniability. If the opponent has at least one 8 (57% chance based on distribution), the bid holds. Challenging now risks a 57% chance they have a 9, making their bid valid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 96253371, I have zero 8s. Since the current bid is 3 8s, and I hold none, all three 8s would have to be in the opponent's hand, which is unlikely given they only have 8 digits. The probability of them having all three 8s is low, so challenging is a strong option.
