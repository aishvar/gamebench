Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without worrying about being too high. I have two 6s and two 4s in my hand. A bid of '2 4s' or '2 6s' seems reasonable and not overly risky, given that I have two of these digits. I'll choose to bid '2 6s' as it's a good starting point.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I don't have any 6s in my hand. However, since the bid is relatively low, and I have no information about the other player's hand, it's safer to make a slightly higher bid than to challenge. I will bid 3 7s.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 6s, and I know there are 16 digits in total. I can see if I increase the quantity or the digit, I can make a valid higher bid. Since my hand contains two 6s, I can confidently bid on this digit. The current bid is 3 7s, so I need to bid higher than this. I can bid 4 6s or 3 8s or higher. I choose to bid 4 6s as it seems reasonable given my hand and the goal to make a higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. I could bid 5 of any digit, or 4 of a digit higher than 6. Since I have three 9s, bidding 4 9s is a safe option that doesn't increase the quantity too much.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains a 6 and a 4, but no 9s. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and with 8 digits in my hand, I can only account for a portion of the bid. Given that the previous bids have been relatively conservative, I should consider if there's a high digit in my hand that could be used to make a valid higher bid. Since I have two 6s and my previous bid was 4 6s, I could try to increase the quantity or the digit. However, I don't have enough information about Player 1's hand. I should challenge if I think the bid is unlikely, or make a higher bid if possible.
