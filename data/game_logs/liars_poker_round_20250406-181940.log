Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. A reasonable next step is to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I see one 0, I can bid 2 0s, but I will instead bid a higher digit to keep the quantity low and make it harder for the other player to challenge. Bidding 1 1s is a valid higher bid because it has a higher digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 2s. My hand is 50458670, which contains one 2 (from the digit '2' in my hand, but I actually have a '5', '0', '4', '5', '8', '6', '7', '0'). Upon closer inspection, I see I have two 0s and no 2s. The bid history started with 1 0s, then 1 1s, and now 1 2s. I can see that my hand has two 0s, which supports the initial bid of 1 0s and suggests there could be more 0s or other digits in the other player's hand. To increase the bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have information that there is at least one 0 (actually, two 0s) in my hand and potentially more in the other player's hand, bidding 1 3s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases the digit. However, considering my hand and the fact that I have no 2s or 3s, I should be cautious. I will bid 2 0s to increase the quantity of a digit I know exists in my hand, making my bid more informed.
