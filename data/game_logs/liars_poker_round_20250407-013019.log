Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 3s, two 9s, one 2, and one 5. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be 2 of a digit I have multiple of. I'll choose 2 3s, as it's a common digit and I hold two myself, making it likely there are more.
