Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (05319428), I have two 1s. Bidding 2 1s is the most conservative and safe starting bid, as it's highly likely to be true given my hand and the absence of any other bids.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 2 1s. Bidding 2 4s is a valid higher bid because the digit is higher, and I know there are at least two 4s in total.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 4s. Since I only have one 4, it's unlikely there are two 4s in total. I should challenge the bid to verify the count.
