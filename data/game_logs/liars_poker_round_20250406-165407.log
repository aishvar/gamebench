--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to make the opening bid. Looking at my hand 57362890, I have one of each digit from 0 to 9 except for 1 and 4. A reasonable conservative opening bid is 2 of a common digit in my hand, such as 2 3s, as it's statistically likely there are at least two 3s across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. I could bid 3 0s, increasing the quantity and choosing a digit I have in my hand. This is a safe but potentially weak move.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 57362890, I have one '0'. The current bid is 3 0s, so across both hands, there must be at least three zeros. Since I only have one, it would require my opponent to have at least two zeros, which is plausible but not guaranteed. Given that zeros are relatively rare, and with only one in my hand, I suspect the bid might be an overestimate. Challenging now could be advantageous.
