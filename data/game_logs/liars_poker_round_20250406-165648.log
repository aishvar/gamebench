Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have no zeros in my hand. I should make a bid that strictly increases the current bid. I have one 2, one 5, one 4, and two 1s. I can make a bid of 3 1s, increasing both quantity and digit.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. I could bid 3 2s, but I have three 0s. I'll bid 4 0s, increasing the quantity and switching the digit to one I have more of.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s and one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 6 0s, which is already high. I'll bid a higher quantity for the digit 1, as I have two 1s in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have 5 0s in my hand. Bidding 7 0s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 7 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. I have three 0s in my hand. Bidding higher on 0s seems risky, as the other player has been consistently raising the bid on 0s. I could bid 8 of another digit, but I don't have enough of any other single digit to feel confident. Since the other player has been raising the bid on 0s consistently, they likely have a few 0s themselves. Given the bidding history, 7 0s might be reasonable, but it's also possible they're bluffing. I will challenge to see if they are bluffing.
