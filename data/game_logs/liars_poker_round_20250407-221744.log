--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 37025501, I have two 0s, two 5s, two 3s, one 7, and one 2. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 5s, as I already have two 5s myself, making it likely that the total number is at least two or possibly more.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s and one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable move, as it increases both the quantity and the digit based on the digits I have.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 3, 7, 0, 2, 5, 5, 0, 1. I have zero 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, which requires at least three 6s across both hands. Since I have none, all three would have to be in the opponent's hand, which is somewhat unlikely but not impossible. Given that, it is risky to challenge now. A safer strategy is to increase the bid modestly. I have two 5s, so a bid of 3 7s (higher digit, same quantity) is unlikely to be immediately challenged and keeps me in the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 7s in my hand, which makes this bid likely true. However, I also have two 6s and one 8. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable next step, as it increases the digit and quantity slightly, making it a plausible bid given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (37025501), I have the digits: 3,7,0,2,5,5,0,1. Counting 6s, I have zero. The opponent has 8 digits, so for their hand to reach the bid of 4 6s, they'd need all 4 (or more) 6s, which is highly improbable. Since I have zero 6s, the total 6s are likely well below 4, making the current bid of 4 6s unlikely to be valid. Therefore, the best move is to challenge.
