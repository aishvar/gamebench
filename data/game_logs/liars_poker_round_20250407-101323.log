Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 1s, two 0s, one 2, one 3, and one 7. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, reflecting my own count and leaving room to increase later.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6. Since the current bid is 2 6s, it is very likely there is at least one more 6 in the opponent's hand, making the current bid plausible. A natural higher bid is 3 6s, which is reasonable given my one 6 and the probability of two more 6s in total across both hands. This bid increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same, and is a safe incremental raise.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (13257506), I have one 7 and one 5. The current bid is 3 7s. Since I only have one 7, the opponent would need to have at least two 7s for the bid to be valid. The probability of the opponent having two or more 7s in their eight digits is low. Additionally, making a higher bid would require either bidding 3 8s or 4 of any digit, but I lack sufficient evidence to confidently do so. Therefore, challenging is the best strategic move.
