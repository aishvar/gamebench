Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is quite weak. I do, however, have three 6s (digits: 6, 9, 9, 7, 5, 8, 6, 8). Since there are 16 digits in total, bidding 3 6s is a safe and stronger bid based on my hand. This increases both the quantity and the digit significantly beyond the minimal opening bid.

Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 7s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s and two 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, and since I hold two 7s, it's quite plausible that there is at least one more 7 in Player 0's hand, making the bid reasonable and risky to challenge. To increase the bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. I also have three 8s in my hand, making a bid of 3 8s very safe, as it's highly probable there are at least three 8s total. Therefore, I will raise to 3 8s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 9s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s (digits: 6, 9, 9, 7, 5, 8, 6, 8). The current bid is 3 9s, so for that bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least one 9. Given the naive opponent's random bidding pattern, it's plausible but not guaranteed they have a 9. Since I already hold two 9s, raising to 4 9s would require the opponent to have at least two 9s, which is unlikely. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity with a digit I hold many of. I have two 6s and two 8s as well. Since the current bid is 3 9s, I can outbid with 4 6s or 4 8s. Both are risky, but with two 8s in my hand, a bid of 4 8s relies on the opponent having at least two 8s, which is unlikely. The same applies to 4 6s. Therefore, the current bid of 3 9s is borderline plausible, but a higher bid would be risky. Given these factors, it's best to challenge the current bid.
