Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, so the total count of 0s is at least 1. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about other digits, I'll increase the quantity. Bidding 2 0s is a safe and reasonable next step.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. My hand is 90480141, which contains one 1. So, the total count of 1s is at least one (mine) plus potentially one more from the other player's hand, making it at least 1 but possibly 2. The current bid of 2 1s is quite aggressive but not impossible. I have two options: either challenge the bid if I think it's unlikely or make a higher bid. Since my hand contains no 2s, 3s, or higher digits in significant numbers, and given that the bid of 2 1s is not extremely high, I'll choose to make a slightly higher bid. Bidding 2 2s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid move according to the rules.
