Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. My hand is 76879480. I have two 7s and two 8s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. There are 16 digits in total (2 players * 8 digits). The expected number of any specific digit across all hands is 1.6 (16 * 1/10). Since I hold two 8s, bidding 'Two 8s' is a statistically reasonable and relatively safe opening bid. It reflects the composition of my hand and uses a higher digit (8) compared to 7, putting slightly more pressure on the opponent for their first bid. It forces them to bid at least 'Three Xs' or 'Two 9s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (75201018), I see that I have one '8'. The current bid is '2 8s' made by Player 0. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one '8', bidding higher on '8' is not possible for me. I should look for a digit that appears more than twice in my hand and bid on that if possible. In my hand, the digit '0' appears twice, which is more than the current bid of '2 8s'. I can make a bid on '0' with a quantity of '2' or higher if I have it. However, I don't want to challenge without a strong reason, and I have a chance to make a higher bid. The digit '1' appears twice as well. Given that I have two '1's and two '0's, I can make a bid of '2 0s' or '2 1s'. Between these, '2 1s' seems like a reasonable next bid because '1' is higher than '8' is not true but having two of them makes it a potential bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (75201018), I see I have one '8' and no information about Player 0's hand. The current bid is '2 8s'. To make a valid higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one '8', bidding higher on '8' is risky without more information. However, I can try to bid on a different digit. I have one '9' but no other digits appear multiple times. Given that I have one '8' and the bid is on '8', I should consider bidding on a digit I have multiple of or challenging if I think the bid is unlikely. My hand does not provide strong evidence to immediately challenge, but I can try to bid higher on a digit I have. I have a '9' which is higher than '8'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 3/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains one 8. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and there are 2 players, I should consider if bidding higher is feasible or if challenging is more strategic.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 76879480, containing two 7s and two 8s. The current bid is 3 7s, made by Player 1. This means Player 1 claims there are at least three 7s across both hands (16 digits total). Since I have two 7s, Player 1 only needs one 7 for their bid to be correct. The probability of Player 1 having at least one 7 in their 8 digits is reasonably high (1 - (9/10)^8 â‰ˆ 57%). Therefore, challenging the bid seems risky, as it's slightly more likely to be true than false. I can make a higher bid. A bid of 3 8s is valid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires Player 1 to have at least one 8 for it to be true. Since I hold two 8s, this is also plausible (probability ~57%). Making this bid leverages my hand (two 8s), is a minimal increase, and puts the pressure back on Player 1. Bidding a quantity of 4 seems too aggressive at this early stage.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (75201018), I see I have one '8' and one '7'. The current bid is '3 8s'. I don't have enough '8's to make a higher bid than 3, but I do have a '7' that could potentially be used to make a valid bid. However, bidding '3 7s' or lower would not exceed the current bid of '3 8s' in terms of quantity or digit. I can try to bid '4 7s' because even if the other player has no '7's, my hand alone could have up to 2 '7's but only 1 '7' is visible. The bid needs to be higher either in quantity or digit. Since I have 1 '7' and 1 '8', and assuming the other player might have some '8's but likely not more than 2 given the current bid, I could challenge or bid higher with a different digit. Given my hand, bidding '4 7s' seems reasonable as it exceeds the quantity of '8s' bid so far and leverages my available digits effectively.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing the current bid of '3 8s' and my hand '75201018', I see that I have one '8'. The current bid is 3 '8s', so I need to either make a higher bid or challenge. Since I only have one '8', bidding higher on '8s' is risky. However, I notice that I have three '7s' in my hand. The last bid was '3 8s', so I can bid higher by quantity with a different digit or by bidding a higher digit with the same or more quantity. My hand contains three '7s', which is more than the current bid quantity of 3 '8s'. I can make a valid higher bid by quantity with a different digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 76879480. I have two 7s and two 8s. The current bid is 4 7s, made by Player 1. For this bid to be true, Player 1 needs to have at least two 7s (since I have two). Player 1 previously bid 3 7s and then raised to 4 7s, suggesting they might have at least one or two 7s, making a challenge risky. I previously bid 2 8s and 3 8s. A bid of 4 8s is a valid next bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires Player 1 to have at least two 8s (since I have two). This is statistically plausible (expected number in 8 unknown digits is 0.8, needing 2 is possible). Bidding 4 8s continues my established pattern, is a relatively safe increment, and puts the pressure back on Player 1, who might not have many 8s given they switched to bidding 7s over my 3 8s bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing the current bid of '4 8s' made by Player 0, I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that Player 0 has overbid. Given my hand '75201018', I count 3 '8s'. Player 0's bid of '4 8s' seems suspiciously high because if they have 8 secret digits, it's unlikely they have more than 4 '8s' themselves. However, without exact information on Player 0's hand, I must focus on my own hand and make a strategic decision. I can see there's a possibility that Player 0 might be bluffing or overestimating. My hand contains 3 '8s', and I also see a '7'. The previous bids have been either '8s' or '7s'. Since I have 3 '7s' or '8s' in total isn't possible as my digits are 7, 5, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 8, I only have 1 '7' and 3 '8s' aren't there but 3 '8s' and 1 '7'. I can bid higher on '8s' or switch to another digit. I have 3 '8s', so bidding '5 8s' would be valid but risky. Instead, I notice I have 1 '7'. If I bid on '7s', I could potentially make a valid higher bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing the current bid of '4 8s' and my hand '75201018', I see that I have one '8' and multiple other digits. The current bid is trying to claim there are at least 4 '8s' in total. Given that I only have one '8', and assuming Player 0 has 3 '8s' (as they bid 4 8s), I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since I don't have enough information to accurately determine if there are indeed 4 '8s', I look for a safer bet. I notice I have three '7s'. The last bid was '4 8s', so I need to either outbid this or challenge. I can try to bid higher with a digit I know exists more frequently, like '7'. I have 3 '7s' and if Player 0 has at least one '7', we could have 4 or more '7s' in total. This seems like a plausible higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 76879480. I have two 7s and two 8s. The current bid is 5 7s, made by Player 1. For this bid to be true, there must be at least five 7s across both hands (16 digits total). Since I have two 7s, Player 1 must have at least three 7s in their 8-digit hand. Player 1 has consistently bid on 7s (3 7s, 4 7s, 5 7s), suggesting they likely hold some 7s. However, needing three 7s from their hand alone is statistically unlikely (the average number of any digit in an 8-card hand is 0.8). While their bidding increases the perceived likelihood, 5 is a relatively high quantity out of 16 total digits (expected value is 1.6). Bidding higher, such as 5 8s, is also risky. I only have two 8s, meaning Player 1 would need three 8s, and they have shown no interest in 8s. Challenging seems like the safer and more statistically sound move, betting against the relatively low probability that Player 1 holds three or more 7s.
