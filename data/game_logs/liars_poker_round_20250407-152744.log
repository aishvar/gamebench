Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening bid and there is no current bid, I want to start with a conservative yet plausible bid based on my hand. I observe that I have two 6s, two 0s, and one or two of other digits. A typical opening bid is around 2 or 3 of a digit I hold multiple of. Starting with 3 6s leverages the fact I have two 6s, making it plausible there is at least one more 6 in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (17830759). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have some information about my hand, I can use it to make an informed decision. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move as it increases the quantity, and I know that there's at least one 6 in my hand. However, considering my hand, there's no 7, 8, or 9, so bidding 3 7s, 3 8s, or 3 9s could be a safer initial move. I'll choose to bid 3 7s as it's a higher digit than 6 and keeps the quantity the same.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (26596310), I have zero 7s. Given there are 16 digits total, the bid of 3 7s requires at least three 7s across both hands. Since I have none, all three would need to be in Player 1's hand, which is unlikely. Statistically, the expected number of 7s across both hands is around 1.6 (16 digits * 1/10). The chance of Player 1 holding all three 7s is low, so challenging is the best move.
