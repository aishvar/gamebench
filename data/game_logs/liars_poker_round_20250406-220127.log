Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand, making the total at least 2. Challenging would be risky as the bid might be valid. I'll bid 2 5s, a higher digit, hoping Player 0 has at least one 5.

Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 5s. Since the bid is already at 2 5s and I only have one, it's unlikely that there is another 5 in the opponent's hand. Challenging seems like the best move here.
