Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid, I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (45516937), I see I have one 5 and no other repeated digits more than twice. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative and based on my hand. I have a total of 8 digits, and the most frequent digit I have is 4 and 5 (each appearing twice), and there are 8 other digits in the opponent's hand. Bidding 3 5s seems like a safe and reasonable starting point because it reflects a possible count considering both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 5s, which suggests the opponent is relying on their own hand containing at least 3 5s, or they are bluffing. Since 3 is a relatively low quantity out of 16 total digits, it's plausible there are 3 5s overall. It's risky to challenge now. Instead, I can make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, such as 3 6s, because I have two 6s in my hand, making it plausible that there are at least three 6s in total.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (from 45516937), so the total count of 6s is at least 1 (mine) plus the count in Player 1's hand. Player 1 must have at least 2 6s to make the bid of 3 6s reasonable. It's possible they have more. I have to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. Bidding 4 6s seems like a safe increase since I'm not sure how many 6s Player 1 has. Increasing the quantity while keeping the same digit is a reasonable move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 17219896, I have two 6s. The current bid is 4 6s, so my two plus the opponent's unknown count would need to be at least two more 6s for the bid to be valid. Statistically, with 8 unknown digits, expecting at least two more 6s is plausible but not highly certain. Pushing to a higher bid like 5 6s would require at least three 6s in the opponent's hand, which is unlikely. Given this, the current bid is borderline, and challenging now is strategically sound.
