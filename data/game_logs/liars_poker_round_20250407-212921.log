Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Analyzing my hand (41644833), the digit counts are: 4s = 3, 1s = 1, 6s = 2, 8s = 2, 3s = 2, and the rest are 0. The strongest digit in my hand is 4, appearing 3 times. As the first bidder, a conservative but strong opening bid is to claim 3 of a digit I hold many of, which is 4. This sets a solid foundation and pressures the opponent to either make a risky higher bid or challenge early.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I need to either make a higher bid or challenge. I have no 4s in my hand. To bid, I could increase the quantity to 4 of any number, or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the number to 5 or higher. I have two 1s, so bidding on 1s might be reasonable. However, I don't have enough information to assess the likelihood of the 3 4s bid being accurate. Since I have no 4s, it's unlikely there are 3 4s in total, but it's possible. I will challenge to gather more information and avoid making a potentially bad bid.
