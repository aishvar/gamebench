--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. As the first bidder, starting with a moderate quantity of a high digit is strategic. Bidding 3 8s leverages my existing pair while leaving room for escalation. The opponent only needs one 8 to make this valid, which is reasonably likely given their 8-card hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 8s, which suggests the likelihood of there being at least three 8s across both hands is lower. Since I hold zero, all three 8s would need to be in Player 0's hand, which is improbable. Therefore, challenging the bid is the optimal move.
