Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s. The current bid is only 1 0s, which is quite conservative given the total of 16 digits and my own hand. Since I hold two 0s, it's very likely there are at least two 0s in total. Therefore, a safe and natural next bid is to increase the quantity to 2 0s, which is strictly higher and well-supported by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 4, 7, 8, 0, 5, 6, 1, 7. I have exactly one '1' in my hand. The current bid is 2 1s, which is plausible since I have one and the opponent likely has at least one as well. It would be risky to challenge now. To overbid, I can either increase the digit at the same quantity or increase the quantity. Since I have one '0' as well, a safe incremental bid is to raise to 2 2s, but I don't know how many 2s are out there. Alternatively, I can bid 2 2s or 3 0s. I have one '0' myself, so 3 0s is plausible. It is safer to raise the quantity on a digit I have. Therefore, bidding 3 0s is a reasonable and safe next move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 47805617, I have one '0' and one '1'. The current bid is 3 1s, which means there must be at least three '1's across both hands. Since I only have one '1', Player 0 would need to have at least two '1's for the bid to be valid. While this is possible, it is not highly probable. Additionally, raising the bid would require either bidding 3 2s or 4 of any digit, but I don't have enough information or strong digits to confidently make a higher bid. Therefore, the optimal move is to challenge the current bid.
