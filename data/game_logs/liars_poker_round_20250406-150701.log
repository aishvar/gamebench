Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (62324560), I see I have a total of 2 zeros, 2 ones (not present), 1 two, 1 three, 1 four, 1 five, 1 six (and other digits not relevant to the initial bid). A reasonable starting bid should be conservative and based on the digits I see. I have two 6s, so bidding on 6s or a lower digit with a quantity of 2 or slightly higher seems reasonable. I'll start with bidding 2 6s as it's a straightforward observation from my hand.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 6s. The current bid is only 2 6s, which is quite plausible since there are 16 digits total and I don't know Player 0's hand. Challenging now would be risky. A safe and strategic move is to increment the bid slightly. Since I have two 9s, bidding 2 9s is a legal and reasonable higher bid (same quantity, higher digit), leveraging my known cards.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 6 in my hand and no 9s. The bid of 2 9s is not very high, and given that I have no 9s, it's possible that the total count of 9s is low. However, I do have a 6, and bidding 2 6s was my previous bid. Player 1 has increased the digit to 9s. I can either challenge or bid higher. Bidding 3 0s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity and changes the digit to a lower one, which might be more plausible given my hand and the fact that we're starting with a low bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 0s. The current bid is 3 0s, so there must be at least one 0 in the opponent's hand to meet that bid. Since it's quite plausible the opponent has at least one 0, challenging now is risky. I can comfortably raise the bid with my two 9s by bidding 3 9s, which is a strictly higher bid (same quantity, higher digit), and leverages my strong holding in 9s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have seen the digits in my hand: 62324560. I count two 9s, but since I don't have any 9s, it's likely that the other player has at least three 9s or is bluffing. However, given that I have 8 digits and none of them are 9s, it's possible the other player has more than three 9s. The bid history started with 2 6s, then 2 9s, then 3 0s, and now 3 9s. The jump from 2 9s to 3 0s and then to 3 9s indicates a possible bluff or a strong hand. Since my hand doesn't contain any 9s, and the quantity is already 3, I should either challenge or make a higher bid. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or bidding the same quantity with a higher digit. I can see that I have a total of 2 6s and 2 5s. A reasonable next step is to increase the quantity or bid a higher digit. Bidding 4 0s seems plausible as it increases the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '14014299', I have three 0s. Since the current bid is 4 0s, this would require my opponent to have at least one 0. Given that I hold three out of sixteen digits, it is somewhat plausible but still risky to assume they have at least one 0. Instead, I have two 9s in my hand, and since the last bid was 4 0s, I can safely raise to 4 9s (same quantity, higher digit), which is a legitimate and safer bid based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have the hand 62324560, which contains one 9. Given that there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand, and I have one 9, the total count of 9s could be higher but is likely limited. The bid of 4 9s is plausible because it suggests there are at least 4 nines in total. However, I can bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about the opponent's hand, I'll consider the probability and the bid history. The next possible bid could be 5 0s or 4 0s (if I were to match the quantity and increase the digit, but 9 is the highest digit). I can bid 5 0s because it increases the quantity. My hand has two 0s, so it's possible there are more 0s. Bidding 5 0s is a reasonable move as it increases the quantity and changes the digit to a lower one, which is a safer move given the context.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '14014299', I have three 0s. The current bid is 5 0s, which would require the opponent to have at least 2 more 0s. Since 0s are generally less common and having five or more in total is somewhat unlikely, especially with me holding 3 already, challenging seems a good strategic move.
