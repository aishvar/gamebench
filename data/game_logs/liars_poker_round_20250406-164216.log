Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It is the first turn, and there is no current bid. I need to make an initial bid. My hand contains two 1s, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 7, one 8, and one 3. A conservative yet reasonable opening bid would be 2 1s, as I already possess two 1s and there is a good chance my opponent has at least one more 1 in their hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand contains several digits, I should consider what I can safely bid without overestimating. I see I have two 2s, which could be useful. However, I should also consider the total number of digits and the possibility of Player 0 having more 1s. Given that I want to increase the quantity or the digit, I can start by bidding 3 2s, as it seems reasonable and higher than the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 2s in my hand, which makes it less likely that there are at least three 2s across both hands. However, it is still possible that Player 1 has multiple 2s, so challenging at this point might be risky. Instead, I will make a higher bid. I have two 1s in my hand, and increasing the bid to 4 1s seems reasonable as it raises the quantity while focusing on a digit I have in my hand.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I need to analyze my hand and the bid history. My hand contains the digits 2, 2, 7, 6, 0, 4, 8, 0. I have a total of 2 zeros, which could be useful. However, I don't have any 1s. Given that the bid is 4 1s and I don't have any 1s, I should consider challenging if I think it's unlikely, or making a bid that I can reasonably support. Since I don't have any 1s, I think it's unlikely that there are 4 or more 1s in total. I should consider making a bid that is higher than 4 1s or challenging. My hand does not have enough 1s to support a bid of 5 or more 1s, but I could make a bid of 4 or more of another digit that I have. Alternatively, I could challenge the bid if I think it's unlikely.
