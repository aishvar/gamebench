Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game, so I need to make a strategic opening. Looking at my hand (73794460), I have: one 0, one 3, one 4, two 6s, one 7, one 9. Since I have two 6s in my hand, that's my strongest digit. For an opening bid, I want to be somewhat conservative but still leverage my knowledge. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable - I know I have 2 already, so I'm only claiming there's one more 6 in my opponent's hand, which is fairly likely given they have 8 random digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 6s. Bidding 4 6s is a higher quantity, and given that I have two, it's possible the total could be four if the opponent has two as well. This seems like a reasonable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The opponent bid 4 6s, meaning they believe there are at least 4 sixes in total between our hands. Since I only have 1 six, that would mean they need to have at least 3 sixes in their hand. While this is possible, it seems somewhat unlikely that they would have 3 or more sixes out of their 8 digits. The probability of having 3+ sixes in 8 random digits is relatively low. I could bid higher, but I don't have strong evidence to support a higher quantity of any digit. I think challenging is the better move here.
