Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I see I have two 7s and one 9, but no extremely high counts of any single digit. A bid of '2 7s' seems reasonable and not overly risky, given that I have two 7s and there's a chance the other player might have some as well.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have two 8s in my hand, and the bid digit is 7. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid can be beaten. My hand contains the digits 7, 9, 1, 0, 5, 6, 1, 8, and 8. I see that I have two 8s and two 1s, along with other digits. Given that the last bid was 3 8s and I have two 8s, I could potentially increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 8s, I can confidently say there are at least 4 8s if I bid. However, I should consider if there's a higher digit I can bid on or increase the quantity significantly. I have two 1s and two 8s, but bidding 4 8s seems risky without knowing the distribution of Player 1's digits. A safer and higher bid would be to go for a digit that I know appears at least twice in my hand and is higher than 8, which doesn't exist, or to increase the quantity with a digit that is reasonable given my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Given the bid history, it's likely that Player 0 has at least one 1, but I'm not convinced they have four. I should bid a higher quantity or digit to increase the stakes.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 2S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains a 7, 9, 6, 5, 1, 8, and 3. I see no 2s, but I do have a 6 and other digits. A reasonable bid would be higher than 5, or if the same quantity, a higher digit. I have a 6 and an 8, but no 2s or higher quantity of any single digit to confidently bid higher. However, I can try to bid with a higher digit but the same quantity. Since I have two digits that could potentially fit into a higher bid (6, 7, 8, 9), I could consider bidding on a higher digit with a low quantity. Given my digits, bidding 6 3s seems reasonable as I have a 3 and can try to increase the quantity or digit slightly.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 3S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 7 3s seems like a reasonable increase in quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 3S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 7 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 3s. Given my hand (79106518), I have a total of 4 threes, which makes 7 3s plausible but I need to verify if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains one 3, so the total count of 3s could be higher. However, I also see that I have two 7s, which could potentially make a strong bid if I choose to increase the quantity or digit. Since the current bid is 7 3s and I have one 3, I should consider if I can safely make a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 3S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 8 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 3s. I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 9 3s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 3S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 9 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 3s. Given that I have two 3s in my hand (79106518), I should consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since the bid history shows increasing quantities and digits, I need to assess if I can reasonably make a higher bid. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and with 8 digits in my hand, I can see if there's a possibility to increase the bid. The current bid is 9 3s, so I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 3s, which matches the current bid quantity but not enough to surpass it with a higher digit or quantity with certainty.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 3S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 10 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 3s. I have a 3 in my hand, so I know at least one 3 exists. The current bid quantity is 10, and I have no information about the other player's digits. I will make a bid that is strictly higher than 10 3s by increasing the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 11 3S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 11 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 11 3s. Given that I have two 3s in my hand (79106518), I should consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are 8 secret digits per player, I must assess if 11 3s is likely or not. With my hand, I have one 3 which could contribute to the count. Considering the bid history and my own digits, I should evaluate if I can reasonably make a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 12 3S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 12 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 12 3s. I have a 3 in my hand. Bidding 13 3s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 13 3S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 13 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 13 3s. Given that I have a 3 in my hand and the total count of 3s could potentially be high, I need to assess the likelihood of there being 13 or more 3s in total. Since there are 16 digits in play (8 from each player), and the bid history shows an increasing number of 3s, I should consider if there's a high probability that there are indeed 13 or more 3s. However, without knowing the exact distribution of digits in the other player's hand, I must weigh the risk of challenging versus bidding. My hand contains one 3, and I have no information about the other player's hand. Given the high bid of 13 3s and without further knowledge, I will challenge because 13 seems extremely high given that I only have one 3 and no information about the other player's 3s.
