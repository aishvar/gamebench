Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. In my hand, I have two 2s, one 1, one 3, one 9, one 7, one 8, and one additional 2 (total three 2s). Starting with a conservative yet reasonable opening bid, '3 2s' reflects my strong holding in 2s, and it's likely there are more among the other players.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand (82427308). The current bid is 3 2s. Since I already have two, it's plausible that there's at least one more 2 among the other players' hands. To be safe, I'll increase the bid by raising the digit to a higher number that I also have in my hand, which is 8. This way, I maintain the quantity but increase the digit, making a valid higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (49013165), and I know there are 8 digits per player across 4 players, making a total of 32 digits. The bid of 3 8s is relatively conservative given the total count could be up to 8 (one per hand). I have a 6 and a 5 in my hand, suggesting other digits are distributed among other players. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit, making it harder for others to have a high count of 9s, and I'm not risking a high quantity.

Requesting action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid can be beaten. My hand contains the digits 4, 6, 5, 8, 9, 9, 6, and 9. I have two 9s and two 6s, but no other 6s or higher quantity of any single digit that could help me make a significantly higher bid with certainty. The bid needs to be higher than 3 9s, so I should either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 9s, I can confidently say there are at least 2 9s in total (including mine). However, bidding 4 9s seems risky without knowing the exact distribution of digits among other players. I also have a 6, which could potentially be part of a higher digit bid, but I don't have enough information to safely assume a higher quantity of 6s or other digits. I will increase the quantity and bid 4 6s because I have two 6s and it's a reasonable increase in quantity while also having a higher digit than 9.

Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 22193278, I have no 6s, so I cannot personally contribute to the current bid of 4 6s. Statistically, with 32 digits total, the average count per digit is about 3.2. A bid of 4 6s is slightly above average but plausible. Since I have zero 6s, the other three players would collectively need to have at least 4 6s, which seems somewhat unlikely but not impossible. Given the early stage of bidding and the relatively low quantity, it's safer to increase the bid slightly rather than challenge now. I notice I have two 2s and one 8, so bidding 4 8s (same quantity, higher digit) seems reasonable and strictly higher.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s. With three other players, it's possible that at least two more 8s are among them, making the bid plausible. However, since I already have two, I can safely increase the bid to 5 8s, which is a higher quantity and still within a reasonable range given the number of players and digits.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. My hand is 49013165, which contains one 8. I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. The total number of 8s across all hands must be at least 5 for the current bid to be valid. Since there are 8 players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 32 digits. Bidding 5 8s suggests that the bidder believes there are at least 5 eights. I have one 8 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Increasing the quantity to 6 with digit 8 is a valid bid (6 8s). However, I should consider if it's likely that there are at least 6 eights. Alternatively, I can bid the same quantity (5) with a higher digit, which would be 5 9s. My hand has one 9, so it's plausible there are others. Bidding 5 9s seems like a reasonable action as it is a higher bid and utilizes the information that I have a 9.

Requesting action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid can be beaten. My hand contains 2 6s and 1 9. Given that the last bid was 5 9s, I should consider if I can safely bid higher or if challenging is a better option. Since my hand has two 6s and the last bid was 5 9s, I can try to bid higher with a digit that has a higher chance of being present in other players' hands or increase the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 6S'
Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '22193278', I have zero 6s. The current bid is 6 6s, which implies that across all 32 digits, there are at least six 6s. Given I hold none, the other three players would need to collectively have all six or more 6s. Statistically, with an average of about 3.2 occurrences per digit across all hands, six is already on the high side, and with me holding none, it's unlikely there are six 6s total. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
