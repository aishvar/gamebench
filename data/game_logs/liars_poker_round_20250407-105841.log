Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9 in my hand. With no bids yet, I can make a bid on any digit. Considering the distribution of digits in a typical 8-digit number, I'll choose a digit that's not too common, but still has a reasonable chance of being in the total count. I'll bid on the digit 4.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 1 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 4s. Given that I have a 4 in my hand, I should consider bidding higher. My hand contains a 4, so I know there is at least one 4. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only know my own hand, I will increase the quantity slightly and choose a higher digit to make it more believable but also risky for the opponent to challenge. The bid of 2 5s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 5S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s and two 9s in my hand. The current bid is only 2 5s. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand. I also have a 9, but 9s are not the current digit, so I'll focus on 6s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I need to analyze my hand and the bid history. My hand contains the digits 4, 9, 0, 6, 9, 7, 3, 5. I have two 6s and two 9s, but no 7s or 8s. Given that I have two 6s and the bid is 3 6s, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s, I can confidently say there are at least two 6s in total. However, bidding 4 6s might be risky without knowing Player 0's hand fully. I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit seems safer and more strategic.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have a 6 in my hand, but no 7s. I can safely increase the digit to 8, as I have no 8s either. Bidding 4 8s seems reasonable and increases the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains 2 sixes and 1 eight. Given that the bid is 4 8s, I must assess if I can reasonably make a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are 8 digits in each player's hand, I have to consider the likelihood of there being 4 or more 8s in total. I also need to evaluate if I can safely make a bid that is higher than 4 8s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 9 in my hand. The current bid is 5 9s. I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity or digit. Since I have a 9 and the current bid is also on 9s, I should increase the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more likely to succeed. My hand contains the digits 4, 9, 0, 6, 9, 7, 3, 5. I have two 9s, which matches the current bid digit but does not provide enough information to safely increase the quantity. However, I do have a 9 and the current bid is 6 9s, so I should consider if I can safely bid higher or challenge. Since I have two 9s and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, bidding higher seems risky without more information. I should consider if there's a likely digit that could have a higher count.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Since the current bid is low, I can increase the quantity or digit. I can bid 8 0s, which is a higher quantity, but I can also bid a higher digit if I have it in my hand. However, I have only one 0, so I will bid a higher quantity to increase my chances of winning.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 8 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 0s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more likely to succeed. My hand contains the digits 4, 9, 0, 6, 9, 7, 3, 5. I have a total of 2 zeros, and given that the bid history has been increasing, I should consider if I can safely make a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent. Since I have 2 zeros and the total number of digits is 16, the maximum possible quantity for 0 is 4 (if I have 2 and Player 0 has 2). Given that the current bid is 8 0s and I have 2 zeros, I could potentially challenge or make a bid that seems reasonable based on my hand and the bid history.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 9 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 10 0s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on the current bid and my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 10 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 0s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. Given my hand (4, 9, 0, 6, 9, 7, 3, 5) and the bid history, I should assess the likelihood of the current bid being valid and my potential to make a higher bid. The bid of 10 0s seems high but I have to consider if it could be true given that there are 16 digits in total across both players' hands.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 11 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 11 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 9 in my hand. The current bid is only 11 0s, which seems unlikely. I should challenge.
