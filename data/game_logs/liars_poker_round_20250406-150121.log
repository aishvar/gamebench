Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. I should start with a conservative bid to gauge the game. I have multiple digits in my hand that could be the basis for a bid. I'll start with a low quantity and digit to test the waters.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, which makes me skeptical that there are at least 2 zeros across all hands, but it is still plausible given 16 unknown digits. Since the bid is quite low, challenging now is risky. A safe strategy is to increase the bid slightly with a digit I have strong holdings in. I have two 8s, so bidding 2 8s matches the quantity but increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid and leveraging my hand strength.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have two 7s and one 8 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are more than 2 8s in total, but I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable move as it increases both the quantity and the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 9, 4, 5, 3, 5, 0, 3, and 0. I have two 0s and two 5s, but no 9s. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. Given that I have two 0s and the bid needs to be strictly higher, I can bid 4 0s as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to 3 9s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 88412629, I have no 0s, so I cannot contribute to the current bid of 4 0s. Since there are 16 unknown digits held by the other two players, for the bid to be valid, they would need to collectively have at least 4 zeros. Statistically, zeros are less common, and with none in my hand, four zeros across the other hands seems unlikely. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bid of 4 0s.
Revealed Hands: P0(meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor):94534530 | P1(openrouter/quasar-alpha):88412629 | P2(mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor):93772652
Actual count of 0s across all hands: 1
Challenge Successful! Actual count (1) < Bid quantity (4).
Winner: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha)
