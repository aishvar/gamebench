Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It is the first bid of the game, and I have two 3s, two 1s, two 6s, one 7, and one 5 in my hand. I want to start with a reasonable bid that reflects my hand while leaving room for escalation. Bidding 3 3s is a safe starting point because I already have two 3s, and the probability of at least one more 3 between both hands is high.

Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 89403826, I have a total of 3 threes, which makes the current bid plausible but not verifiable for me. I will increase the quantity and keep the digit the same, or increase the digit. Given that I have one 8, one 9, and other digits that could potentially be higher than 3, I can try to bid higher with a reasonable chance of winning. I will bid 4 3s because I have to assess if my digits can support a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 3s. The current bid is 4 3s, meaning there would need to be at least two more 3s in Player 1's hand to meet the bid. This seems plausible, but rather than challenge, I can safely increase the bid by switching to a higher digit. I also have two 6s in my hand, making a bid of 4 6s reasonable and strategically safer than challenging at this stage.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. Given that I have one 6 in my hand and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I need to assess if bidding higher is reasonable or if challenging is more likely to succeed. My hand contains one 6, so I know there are at least 3 sixes in total (2 from the other player and 1 from me). The current bid of 4 6s seems plausible but I should consider if I can reasonably increase the bid or if challenging is a better option.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s, and I have two 6s in my hand. This means there need to be at least three more 6s in Player 1's hand to meet the bid. Given the distribution of digits, this is plausible but not guaranteed. However, rather than challenging, I can make a safe higher bid. Increasing the quantity to 6 6s is a logical step since I already have two and thereâ€™s a reasonable chance Player 1 has at least four. This keeps me in the game without risking an immediate challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 6S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I need to assess the likelihood of there being 6 or more 6s in total. Given that I have one 6 in my hand and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I should consider the probability of this bid being true. Since I do not have information about Player 0's hand, I must make an educated guess based on the bid history and my own hand. My hand contains one 6, and I know that there are 16 digits in total between both players. If I assume Player 0 might have a few 6s but not too many, I still need to make a bid that seems reasonable but also challenging for Player 0. I will increase the quantity slightly and stick with a higher digit than 6, as there might be fewer high digits.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. In my hand (75131326), I have one 7. To meet the bid, there would need to be at least six more 7s in Player 1's hand. This seems plausible but not guaranteed. However, I can reasonably make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 8, as I have no 8s in my hand, leaving a higher probability that Player 1 holds enough 8s to justify the bid. Bidding 7 8s increases the digit without increasing the quantity, keeping pressure on Player 1.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 8S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 7 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 8s. I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is the better option. My hand contains the digits 8, 9, 4, 0, 3, 2, 6, and 5. I have one 8 and no information about Player 0's hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and considering the bid history, I should try to make a higher bid if possible or challenge if the bid seems unlikely. Since I have one 8 and the bid is 7 8s, I should consider if I can safely bid higher or if challenging is more prudent.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 8 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 9s, which means there must be at least eight 9s across both hands. In my hand, I have no 9s, making it highly unlikely that there are eight 9s in total since the other player would need to have all eight. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and the bid history shows a steady escalation, this bid seems overly aggressive. I believe it's a bluff and should challenge the bid.
