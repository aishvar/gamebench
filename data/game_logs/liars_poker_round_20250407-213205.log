Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand (53865146), the digit '5' appears once, '3' once, '8' twice, '6' twice, '1' once, and '4' once. A good opening bid is typically on a digit I have multiple times, such as '8' or '6', since I know there are at least 2 of them. Starting with '2 8' is a safe and reasonable opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (62973881), I see I have three 8s. The current bid is '2 8s'. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have three 8s, I can bid higher on the digit 8 or bid on a higher digit if I have it. The digit 8 seems like a safe bet since I have three of them, which already exceeds the current bid quantity of 2.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (53865146), I have a single '8'. The opponent bid 3 total 8s, implying they likely have at least 2 or are bluffing. Since I only see 1 eight, for the total to be 3, the opponent would need at least 2 eights in their hand of 8 digits. This is plausible, but somewhat unlikely given the distribution. Raising to 4 eights would be risky without more evidence. Therefore, the best move is to challenge, as the bid of 3 eights is likely an overstatement.
