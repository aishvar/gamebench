Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there has been no bid yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 1s, one 3, one 6, one 9, and one 0. A safe opening bid would be 2 of a digit I have multiple of. I have two 5s and two 1s, so I'll start with 2 5s, as 5 is a mid-range digit that might be common.
