Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning I can make any initial bid I want. I have a 5, 1, 0, 9, 8, 0, 2 in my hand. I see two 0s, which is a good starting point. Bidding 2 0s seems reasonable and low-risk given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I already hold two 2s in my hand, guaranteeing at least two 2s in total. This makes '2 2s' a safe higher bid than '2 0s'.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have two 0s in my hand and the bid history shows a 2 0s bid previously. Given that my hand contains 2 zeros, I should increase the bid quantity or digit. The bid of 2 2s seems low given that there are 16 digits in total and I have knowledge of my own hand. I will increase the quantity slightly to test the other player's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have exactly one '0' in my hand, so the opponent would need at least two '0's in theirs to meet 3 total. Statistically, thatâ€™s unlikely (less than a 20% chance). Challenging is therefore my best move.
