--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. I have two 4s in my hand, which is a good starting point. Bidding 3 4s seems reasonable, as it increases both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s and two 8s, but no 4s. The current bid is 3 4s, which requires there to be at least three 4s across both hands. Since I have zero 4s, that would mean my opponent must have all three or more 4s, which is unlikely. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
