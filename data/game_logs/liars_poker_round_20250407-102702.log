Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid, so I want to start with a conservative but credible opening. In my hand, I have one 0, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 7, one 9, and two 7s. Since I have two 7s, bidding 3 7s is a solid opening bid that likely covers at least one 7 in the opponent's hand, making it a reasonable and safe start.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 5, 9, 7, 0, 4, 6, 7, 2 â€” notably, I have zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, meaning there must be at least three 8s combined between both hands. Since I have none, the entire count would need to come from Player 1's hand. Given that they only have 8 digits, it's quite unlikely they hold three or more 8s, as that would be an unusually high concentration. Therefore, challenging is the best strategic move.
