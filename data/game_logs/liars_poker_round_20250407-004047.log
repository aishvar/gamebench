Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. I have two 9s in my hand, which is a strong starting point. Bidding 3 9s seems reasonable, as it increases both quantity and digit based on my hand, and it's a safe starting bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 27158465, I have two 9s. I also notice that I have three 6s, which could be a good opportunity to increase the quantity while choosing a higher digit than 9. However, I should be cautious about the possibility of Player 0 having a high count of 9s. Given that I have no information about Player 0's hand, I will make a conservative bid that is higher than 3 9s. I will bid 4 6s, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 6s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and I don't contribute any 6s, it's unlikely there are 4 or more 6s in play. Challenging seems like the best move.
