Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, making it less likely there are many 0s overall, but the current bid is only 1 0s, which is quite plausible given 16 total digits. Challenging now would almost certainly lose. To increase the bid, the minimal strictly higher bid is 1 1s. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding 2 1s is safe and credible, increasing both the quantity and changing the digit to one I hold multiples of.
