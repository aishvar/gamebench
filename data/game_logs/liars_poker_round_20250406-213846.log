Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make a reasonable starting bid. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding 3 1s is a cautious yet strategic move, assuming there's at least one more 1 in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 8, one 2, one 7, one 4, one 6, and two other digits (8 and 3) in my hand, but I don't have any 1s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about the other player's hand, I'll base my decision on my own hand and the current bid. Bidding 3 2s is a safe increase in digit, and it's plausible given that there are 16 digits in total.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have one 2 in my hand, making the total potentially two or three depending on Player 1's hand. Challenging seems risky, but given the likelihood that Player 1 might not have enough 2s to meet the bid, I choose to challenge.
