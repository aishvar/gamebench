Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s. The current bid is only 1 0s, so I already know there are at least two 0s, making it safe to increase the bid. The natural move is to raise the quantity to 2 0s, which is a minimal and safe increment given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 1s. The current bid is 2 1s, which can be fully accounted for just from my own hand, making it very likely true or even an underestimate. Since I cannot challenge a bid that is definitely valid, I should increase the bid. The minimal strictly higher bid would be 2 2s, as the quantity remains the same but the digit increases. I have one 2 in my hand, so it's plausible there could be at least two 2s across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 1s, two 2s, one 0, one 9, one 3, and one other digit. The current bid is 2 3s, and I have exactly one 3. Given the total of 16 digits, it's plausible there are two 3s overall, but to continue the game strategically, I can safely raise the bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have two 2s, so bidding 2 4s or 3 1s would be riskier. Instead, increasing the digit on quantity 2 to 4s is a safe minimal raise.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 8 digits, I have two 1s, two 2s, one 0, one 9, one 3, and one 9. The current bid is 2 5s, but I have zero 5s. Since the opponent is naive and has been incrementally increasing the digit without changing quantity, it's plausible they also have zero or maybe one 5. The likelihood that there are at least two 5s total is moderate, but since the bid is not aggressive, it's safer to increment the bid. I have two 2s, so bidding 3 2s is a reasonable and safe increase based on my hand, exceeding both the quantity and the digit of the current bid.
