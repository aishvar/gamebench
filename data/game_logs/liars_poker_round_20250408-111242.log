Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no existing bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 4s, and one 0, 3, 3, 6 each. Opening conservatively with a common digit is typical. I'll start with '2 4s' since I hold two 4s myself, making it a safe and reasonable initial bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 2 4s, I should aim to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I should focus on increasing the quantity or digit based on my hand. I have the digits 7, 9, 8, and 6 in my hand. Considering these digits, I can make a reasonable bid by increasing the quantity and digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (09341641), I have zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, which requires at least three 8s across both hands. Since I hold none, my opponent would need all three or more 8s, which is unlikely given the distribution of digits across 16 total. The probability of them holding three or more 8s is low, making this a good spot to challenge.
