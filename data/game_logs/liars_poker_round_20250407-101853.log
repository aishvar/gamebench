Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 2, 3, 9, 4, 7, 1, 8, 2, which contains no 0s. Since the bid is only 1 0s, it is quite plausible that the opponent has at least one 0 in their hand, so challenging now is risky. To make a safe higher bid, I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have two 2s in my hand, so bidding 1 2s is certainly safe and strictly higher than 1 0s.
