Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand 48700943, I have two 0s, two 4s, and two 3s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 0s, reflecting my own hand and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I don't know how many 0s are out there, but I can safely bid higher based on the information I have. I can bid 3 1s, which increases the quantity and uses a digit I have in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 48700943, I have two 0s and zero 1s. The current bid is 3 1s, which requires at least three 1s between both hands. Since I have none, the opponent would need to have all three 1s, which is possible but somewhat unlikely. However, since I have two 0s, and my initial bid was 2 0s, it's quite probable there could be at least three 0s between both hands, making a bid of 3 0s a safe incremental raise that is strictly higher (same quantity as current bid but higher digit).

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 48700943, I have two 0s and no 1s. The current bid is 3 1s, which seems plausible since I have none but the opponent might have several. Instead of challenging a reasonable bid early, I'll increase the bid based on my two 0s. Since the previous bid of 2 0s has already been surpassed, the next valid bid involving 0s would be 3 0s, which is higher than 3 1s due to digit order. This is a safe incremental bid leveraging my known 0s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 3/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s and two 4s, along with one each of 8, 7, 9, and 3. The current bid is 3 1s, but I have no 1s, so the likelihood of 3 or more 1s between both hands is moderate but uncertain. Since I have two 0s, it's reasonable to increase the quantity to 3 and choose a digit I hold multiple times. Thus, bidding 3 4s (matching quantity but a higher digit) is a safe and legal raise based on my hand.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. I could bid 3 5s, but I have a 5 in my hand, so bidding 4 5s is a slightly more informed decision. It increases the quantity and relies on my having at least one.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 48700943, I have two 0s and two 4s, but no 5s. The current bid is 4 5s. Since I have zero 5s, for the bid to be valid, my opponent would need to have all 4 or more 5s, which is unlikely given 8 digits. The probability of 4 or more 5s in their hand is quite low. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
