Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 0s, one 3, one 2, one 4, and two 5s. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 0s, reflecting my own hand and leaving room for escalation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. I could bid 3 0s, but it's risky. I also have two 1s. I can safely bid 3 1s, increasing the quantity and digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s and zero 1s. The current bid is 3 1s. Since I have no 1s, the likelihood that there are at least three 1s in total depends entirely on the opponent having all three or more. Given that each player has 8 digits, it's unlikely the opponent has 3 or more 1s alone, especially since I have none. Therefore, challenging this bid is a strong move.
