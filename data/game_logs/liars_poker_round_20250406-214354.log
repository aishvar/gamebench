Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so any valid bid is acceptable. I have two 6s, two 7s, one 8, one 9, and one 5 in my hand. Bidding 1 9s is a safe and reasonable starting bid, as it's based on a digit I have and isn't overly aggressive.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 2 3s is a valid higher bid than 1 9s because the quantity is higher (2 > 1). Since I have two 3s, the total count will be at least two, making the bid safe.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. Bidding higher than 2 3s is possible. I have two 6s, two 7s, and one 8, 9, 5 and 2. I could bid 3 3s, but that's risky since I don't have any. I could bid 3 5s, 3 6s, or higher. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as I have two 6s. Alternatively, I could challenge, but 2 3s doesn't seem *that* unlikely. I'll go with a bid that leverages my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand, and considering the bid history, it's unlikely there are three 6s in total. Challenging this bid could reveal the true count and potentially win the round.
