Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 1s, and one each of 2, 3, 6, and 9. Starting with a modest but reasonable bid based on my two 7s, I will open with '2 7s'.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 08590138. The current bid is 2 7s. I have zero 7s. Challenging a low bid like 2 7s is risky, as it's quite possible there are two 7s across the 16 total digits (Player 0 might have two, or one, and I have zero). I need to make a higher bid. Options are 2 8s, 2 9s, or 3 of any digit. I have two 0s and two 8s. Bidding 2 8s is safe (guaranteed by my hand) and higher than 2 7s. However, a slightly stronger bid is preferable. Bidding 3 0s leverages my two 0s. It requires Player 0 to have at least one 0, which is statistically likely given they have 8 digits. This increases the quantity from 2 to 3, putting more pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '31977621', I have zero 0s. Since the current bid is 3 0s, it requires there to be at least 3 zeros among both hands. Given I have none, all three would have to be in Player 1's hand, which is unlikely as 3 out of 8 digits being zeros is a low probability event. Therefore, it is reasonable to challenge this bid.
