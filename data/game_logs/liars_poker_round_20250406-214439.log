Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that there are no previous bids and I have a hand with repeated digits, I should start with a conservative bid that reflects the information I have. My hand contains two 6s and two 2s, suggesting that bidding on one of these digits could be a safe start. Since the goal is to make a valid higher bid and there's no current bid to compare to, I'll choose a quantity and digit from my hand that seems plausible for an initial bid. Bidding on the 2s seems like a good starting point because it's a digit I have multiple of, and starting with a lower digit gives room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. Bidding 3 2s would be a bluff, but not a very strong one. I have two 5s and two 9s. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have the cards to potentially back it up. Bidding 3 9s is also an option, but 5s feels slightly safer given the limited information.

Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. Given that I only have one 5, it's possible but not guaranteed that the total count of 5s across both hands is 3. However, since I don't have any information about Player 1's hand and considering the bid history started with a relatively low bid of 2 2s, bidding higher seems like a safer option than challenging directly. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have enough information to safely increase the quantity of 5s, I should look for a higher digit that I have at least one of, to make a reasonable bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit to 7 seems reasonable as it's a valid higher bid, and I don't have any strong indication that there are many 6s. Bidding 4 6s is also an option, but it feels slightly more risky given I only have one 6. Therefore, I will bid 3 7s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. Given the current bid is 3 7s, to make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I only have one 7, bidding on a higher quantity of 7s might be risky without knowing the opponent's hand. However, I can consider bidding on the next higher digit, which is 8, but I have no 8s in my hand. Considering the bid history, my previous bid was 3 6s, and the opponent responded with 3 7s, indicating they might have at least one 7. Given the information and the need to make a strictly higher bid, challenging the current bid seems like a viable option, especially since I don't have enough information to safely increase the quantity or digit.
