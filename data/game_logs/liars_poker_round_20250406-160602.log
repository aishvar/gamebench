Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game. My hand is 94850487. I have two 8s and two 4s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. The expected number of any digit across all 16 digits (2 players * 8 digits) is 1.6. Having two 8s means bidding three 8s requires my opponent to have at least one 8, which is statistically likely. Starting with '3 8s' is a reasonably strong opening bid based on my hand, using a high digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. Since there are 16 digits total, and the current bid is 3 8s, this would require at least two 8s in the opponent's hand. Having three or more 8s in total is plausible, but uncertain. Making a minimal overbid to increase the pressure seems safer than challenging now, especially since bidding 3 9s is a strictly higher bid and does not increase the quantity. This keeps options open for future rounds.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 94850487. It contains one '9' and two '8's. The current bid is '3 9s' by Player 1. For this bid to be true, Player 1 must have at least two '9's (3 total - 1 in my hand = 2). This is possible, but not guaranteed. My previous bid was '3 8s', based on my two '8's. Player 1 did not challenge that bid, instead raising minimally to '3 9s'. This suggests Player 1 might have at least one '8', making a challenge less appealing for them if I bid 8s again. Bidding '4 8s' leverages my known strength (two 8s), is a natural progression from my previous bid, and puts pressure back on Player 1. It requires Player 1 to hold at least two '8's for the bid to be accurate. Given my hand and the bid history, '4 8s' seems like a strong, justifiable bid.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. The current bid is 4 8s, meaning there should be at least four 8s among the total 16 digits. Since I only have one, Player 0 would need to have at least three 8s to make this bid valid, which is quite unlikely. Given typical digit distribution, four 8s is on the higher side, and based on my hand, I think challenging is the best move.
