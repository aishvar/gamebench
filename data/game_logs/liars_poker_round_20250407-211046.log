Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have the digits: 8, 5, 0, 5, 4, 4, 3, 0. Counting the digits, I see two 0s, two 5s, two 4s, one 3, and one 8. The most frequent digits in my hand are 0, 4, and 5, each appearing twice. For an opening bid, it's generally strategic to start conservatively yet credibly. Given that I have two 5s, bidding 3 fives seems reasonable, as it is likely the opponent has at least one 5 in their hand, making the total at least 3. This is a safe, strong opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '3 5s'. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains one '5'. To make a valid higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the maximum possible quantity is 16 and there are 2 players, I can potentially bid higher if I think there are enough digits in my hand and the opponent's hand to make the bid valid. However, without knowing the opponent's hand, I must make an educated guess. The digit '5' appears once in my hand. If I bid '4 5s', it implies there are at least 3 '5s' in total (since 3 were already bid). Given my hand only has 1 '5', I'm inclined to challenge if I think the bid is unlikely to be true or make a conservative bid. But first, let's see if we can make a safe higher bid. A safe bet would be to bid on a digit that is more likely to appear in both hands or bid higher on '5' if we think the opponent might have a '5'. However, bidding higher than '3 5s' with '4 5s' seems risky without more information. A more conservative approach would be to challenge if we think 3 '5s' is unlikely.
