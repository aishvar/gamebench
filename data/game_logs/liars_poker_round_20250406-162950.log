Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I will start with a reasonable opening bid. In my hand, I have two 0s, two 1s, one 2, one 3, one 9, and one more 0. The most common digits are 0 and 1, each appearing twice. With 16 digits total in play, it's reasonable to assume at least 3 of a common digit like 1 across both hands. Therefore, I will open with a conservative bid of 3 1s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the probability of the current bid '3 1s' being valid. Looking at my hand (43898543), I have zero 1s. Since the opponent bid 3 1s, they must believe there are at least 3 ones between both our hands. Since I have none, all 3 would need to be in their hand. With 8 digits per player, it's certainly possible they have 3 or more 1s. Given this is the opening bid and relatively conservative (only 3 of a digit), I don't think challenging is wise. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have two 3s, one 4, one 5, two 8s, and one 9 in my hand. I could bid '3 2s' (same quantity, higher digit), but I don't have any 2s. I could bid '3 3s' based on my two 3s, assuming the opponent might have at least one more. Or I could bid '4 3s', '3 4s', etc. Since I have two 8s in my hand, bidding '3 8s' seems reasonable - it's a higher digit than 1s with the same quantity, and I already have two 8s in my hand, so I only need one more 8 from my opponent's hand for this to be true.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 91230011, I have three 1s, no 8s. The current bid is 3 8s. Since I have zero 8s, for there to be at least three 8s, the opponent would need to have all three or more, which is unlikely given only eight digits. The probability that the opponent has three or more 8s is low, so it's a good opportunity to challenge.
