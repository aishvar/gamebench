Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. For a first bid, I should make a conservative bid that leaves room for others while being reasonably likely. Since I know I have one 5, bidding 3 5s assumes opponent has two 5s which is plausible.

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I can see all 8 of my digits and have zero 6s in my hand. For the bid of '3 6s' to be true, my opponent would need 3 or more 6s in their hand. The probability of having 3+ sixes in 8 random digits is relatively low. Given I have no 6s and the current bid claims 3 total, this seems unlikely.
