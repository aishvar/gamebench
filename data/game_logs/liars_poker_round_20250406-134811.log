--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s and two 9s. A bid of 2 6s seems reasonable as it reflects my hand without overestimating.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 30592382, I have zero 6s. Since the current bid is only 2 6s, it's quite plausible that my opponent has two or more 6s, so challenging now is risky. The minimum valid higher bid would be 2 7s. Given that I have two 8s, I can safely increase the bid to 2 8s, which is a small but safe escalation that leverages my hand strength without overcommitting.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have a hand with several digits, but I need to assess the likelihood of the bid being valid and consider my own digits. My hand contains two 6s, which could potentially be part of a higher bid. Since the bid is only 2 8s, and there are 16 digits in total, I should consider if I can make a reasonable bid that is higher. A bid of 3 6s seems plausible as it increases both quantity and digit from the previous bids.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 30592382, which contains one 6 and two 8s. The current bid is 3 6s. Since I only have one 6, Player 0 would need to have at least two 6s for the bid to be valid. The probability of Player 0 holding two or more 6s in their 8 digits is moderate but not certain. However, since I have two 8s, a safe and valid higher bid is to keep the quantity at 3 but increase the digit to 8s, resulting in '3 8s'. This is a strategic move because I know I already hold two 8s, so only one more 8 is needed in Player 0's hand, which is quite plausible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid is incorrect. My hand contains two 6s and other digits, but no 8s. Given that the last bid was 3 8s, I should consider if I can safely make a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent. Since I have two 6s and the current bid is 3 8s, I can try to bid higher with a digit that I know exists in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 30592382, I have zero 6s and two 8s. The current bid is 4 6s. Since I have no 6s, the opponent must have all 4 or more 6s to make the bid valid, which is quite unlikely given only 8 digits in their hand. The average number of any digit per player is roughly 1.6 (16 digits / 10 digits = 1.6 per digit), so 4 or more 6s is statistically improbable. Therefore, it's a good opportunity to challenge.
