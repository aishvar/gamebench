Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4, one 2, and one 1 in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a low quantity and a digit I have in my hand. I'll bid 1 4s, increasing the quantity and digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 1 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 4s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand contains the digits 9, 4, 0, 3, 7, 3, 2, 2, I can see that I have two 2s, two 3s, and two 4s are not present but one 4 is present, but I have no 4s but have 2 2s, 2 3s. Considering I have one 4, bidding 2 4s or higher quantity with a higher digit seems reasonable. However, I should also consider the total possible digits and my own hand strength. I have two 3s and two 2s but no other digit appears more than once besides these. My best option seems to increase the quantity or digit. I have one 4, so bidding 2 4s seems like a reasonable increase in quantity considering I only have 1 4.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 3 4s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 4S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 9, 4, 0, 3, 7, 3, 2, 2. I see two 4s and two 3s, and one 2, one 7, one 0, one 9. The highest digit I have is 9 and 7 and 3 and 2 are lower than 4, but I have two 3s which could help if I bid on 3 or 4. However, I only have one 4. I should bid higher than 3 if possible, or bid on a digit I have multiple of. I can bid 4 3s because I have two 3s and it's higher than 3 4s in quantity or digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. Given my hand contains a 3, I should aim to bid a higher quantity or digit. However, since I don't have any digits higher than 3, I'll focus on increasing the quantity. I have two 4s in my hand, so I can safely bid 5 4s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 4S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains 2 3s and 1 4, and no information about Player 0's hand is available. However, given that the current bid is 5 4s, I must assess the likelihood of there being at least 5 4s in total. Since I only have 1 4 in my hand, I will focus on making a valid higher bid. I can see that bidding 6 4s or higher would be risky without knowing the distribution of digits in Player 0's hand. A safer approach would be to bid on a digit I have in my hand, increasing the quantity. I have two 3s and can bid on 3s. The current bid is 5 4s, so I need to bid higher than 5. I will bid 6 3s as it's a higher quantity and I have two 3s in my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. I have two 3s in my hand. To make a higher bid, I could increase the quantity, but 7 3s is too large. Alternatively, I can increase the digit to 3, but then I'd need at least 7 3s in total, which is still unlikely. However, I can increase the digit to 4, which is possible given my hand. I have one 4, so I can make a reasonable bid by increasing the digit to 4.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 3 in my hand. The current bid is 6 3s. Bidding 7 3s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 3S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 7 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 3s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 9, 4, 0, 3, 7, 3, 2, 2. I see two 3s and one 4 and one 7. I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Since the current bid is 7 3s, I should consider a higher quantity or a higher digit. I have two 2s, but bidding 8 2s or higher seems risky without knowing the distribution of other digits. However, bidding 8 4s seems reasonable as I have one 4 and it's a higher digit than 3.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 4S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 8 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 8 4s, I notice that the digit 4 has been a focus for both players. Since I have a 4 in my hand, I can increase the quantity to 9, but I'd be better off increasing the digit to 5 or more, considering the bids have been incrementing. However, I don't have any digits greater than 4, so I'll stick with the next highest digit I can use, which is 5. I can also consider the fact that the bid history shows an alternating pattern of increasing quantity and digit, but I don't have enough information to confidently predict the next bid. Therefore, I'll make a bid that's higher in both quantity and digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 5S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 9 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 5s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid can be beaten. My hand contains the digits 9, 4, 0, 3, 7, 3, 2, 2. I have two 3s and two 2s but no 5s or 6s or higher. The highest digit I can confidently bid on is the 3 since I have two of them. However, I need to consider if bidding higher on 3 or another digit is more strategic. Given that 9 5s is a high bid and I don't have any 5s or higher digits in abundance, I should consider if challenging could be more beneficial or if a strategic bid can be made.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 3S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 10 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 3 in my hand. The current bid is 10 3s, but I can't be sure if Player 1 has more 3s. I should bid a higher quantity of a different digit or challenge the bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
