Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 5s, and one each of 1, 2, 3, 0, and 4. Starting conservatively, a bid of 3 5s seems reasonable because I have two 5s and it's likely the opponent has at least one 5. This is a safe opening bid that doesn't overcommit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 1, 8, 5, 2, 3, 0, 4. I have zero 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, meaning the opponent claims there are at least 3 sixes across both hands. Since I have none, all three would have to be in their hand, which is unlikely but possible. Given that 3 is a modest quantity and challenging now carries a significant risk, it's safer to continue bidding. I will increase the digit to 3 7s, which is a strictly higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, so with my two 8s, the opponent only needs to have one 8 to make the bid valid, which is quite plausible. Therefore, challenging now is risky. To continue, I can either increase the digit to 3 9s or increase the quantity. Since I have no 9s, a safer approach is to increase the quantity on a digit I have some of. I have two 5s and two 8s, but since the last bid was 3 8s, the next valid higher bid could be 4 5s, 4 6s, 4 7s, or 4 8s. Given my hand, bidding 4 5s leverages my two 5s and is a reasonable incremental bid.
