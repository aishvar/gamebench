Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Considering my hand (83784835), I have a high count of the digit 8. With 3 occurrences of the digit 8 in my hand, it's possible that the other player also has some 8s. However, to make a safe initial bid, I'll choose a digit with a moderate to high count in my hand. The digit 8 appears three times in my hand, which is a good starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 eights. Looking at my hand (19692205), I have zero 8s. Since I have none, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have all 3 or more eights, which is unlikely given that the expected average per digit is roughly 1.6 (16 digits / 10 possible digits). Given I have zero 8s, the probability the opponent has 3 or more is quite low. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move.
