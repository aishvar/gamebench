Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 3 0s is reasonable since there are 16 total digits, and the opponent's 8 digits could include at least one more 0. Starting with a moderate bid on a common digit like 0 balances risk and plausibility.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (64282799), I have no 0s. Since the total number of digits is 16 and I hold 8 of them, the other player would need to have at least 3 zeros to make the bid of 3 0s valid. Statistically, having 3 or more zeros in their 8 digits is unlikely, especially given I have none. Therefore, challenging is a good move here.
