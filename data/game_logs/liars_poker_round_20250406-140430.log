Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. I'll start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 4s, so bidding 2 4s seems reasonable.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have one 4 in my hand (90644752). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have a lot of information about other players' hands, I'll play it safe and increase the digit. Bidding 2 5s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s, which means Player 1 believes there are at least 2 fives across all players' hands. Since I have one 5, this is quite plausible. I need to either make a higher bid or challenge. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, which gives me some confidence to bid on 1s. I also have one 7 and one 8, but less information about how common these are across other hands. Given that the bidding is still quite low (only quantity 2), I'll make a higher bid rather than challenge. I'll bid 3 1s, increasing the quantity to 3 while bidding on a digit I have multiple of in my hand.

Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 3, 8, 4, 4, 2, 0, 7, 0. I see two 0s, two 4s, and one 8, and no 1s or 2s or 6s or 5s or 9s. The highest possible digit I can bid on with confidence is the 4 since I have two 4s. I also notice that bidding a 2 seems reasonable since I have two 0s and two 4s, and there are only 8 digits total in my hand, so I should try to increase quantity or digit. I will bid 4 4s because I have two 4s and it seems unlikely that there are 3 or more 1s in total, and I can try to increase the quantity or digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I need to make a bid that is higher. My hand is 90644752, which contains two 4s and no 5s or higher digits that would immediately help with a higher bid. I have to decide whether to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 4s, it's likely that the total count of 4s is at least 6 (2 from each of the 3 players). Therefore, bidding 5 4s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. However, I can also consider bidding 4 5s to keep the quantity the same but increase the digit. Given that I don't have any 5s, I'm taking a bit of a risk by bidding 4 5s, but it's still a relatively safe bet compared to bidding a much higher quantity. I'll choose to bid 4 5s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand (the 5th and 7th digits). The current bid is 4 5s, which means there would need to be at least 2 more 5s between the other two players' hands to make this bid valid. With 16 unknown digits between the other players, it's certainly possible they have 2 or more 5s. However, I also notice that Player 1 has been consistently bidding on 5s, first with 2 5s and now with 4 5s, which suggests they may have several 5s in their hand. Looking at the bidding history, Player 0 seems confident in 4s, and I already bid on 1s (I have one 1 in my hand). I could increase to 5 5s, but that's risky since I only have 2. I could switch to a digit I have more of, like 8s (I have one 8), but I'd need to bid at least 5 8s to be higher than 4 5s. Given my hand, I think the safest move is to bid 4 6s, which is higher than 4 5s because of the higher digit, and I don't need to increase the quantity.

Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid can be beaten. My hand contains 3, 8, 4, 4, 2, 0, 7, and I have no 6s. Given that the bid is 4 6s, I should consider if there's a possibility that there are indeed at least 4 sixes in total. Since I have no 6s, I will have to rely on the possibility that the other players' hands do not have enough 6s to meet this bid. I will challenge the bid as it seems high given the number of digits in play and my own hand.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) challenges Player 2's (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bid of 4 6s.
