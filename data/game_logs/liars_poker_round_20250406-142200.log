--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s and two 5s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 4 players with 8 secret digits each, bidding a low quantity with a high digit seems reasonable. I will start with a bid of 2 6s as I have two 6s in my hand and it seems unlikely that other players would have many 6s or higher digits.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s (digits: 6,6,3,4,2,4,3,9). Since the current bid is 2 6s, and I alone hold two, it's quite likely there are at least a few more 6s among the remaining 24 digits. Therefore, challenging now is risky. The safest move is to increase the bid slightly, for example to 3 6s, which is a minimal but valid raise and still plausible given my hand and the probabilities.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 3 and no 6s in my hand. The bid history indicates that Player 0 thought there were at least 2 6s and Player 1 increased it to 3 6s. Given that I don't have a 6, I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 3 6s across all hands. With 24 digits from other players, it's possible they have 3 or more 6s. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. I will make a higher bid by increasing the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s, which seems plausible but slightly aggressive given the previous bids. Since I don't have strong evidence to challenge and I can make a higher bid, I will bid 4 7s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have two 6s in my hand, and the previous bids were all about 6s. Given that my hand contains two 6s and the last bid was about 7s, I should try to increase the quantity or digit. Since I don't have any 7s, I will bid higher on a different digit. My hand contains two 6s, so bidding 5 6s seems reasonable as it's higher than the previous bids of 4 6s and also higher in quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 6s. The current bid is 5 6s, so there need to be at least two more 6s among the remaining 24 digits. Statistically, with four players and 32 digits total, each digit appears roughly 3 times on average. Since I already have 3 of the 6s, it's plausible there are 2 more, but it's also quite risky. Given the bid history aggressively pushing 6s and a switch to 7s then back to 6s, it suggests some bluffing or overestimation. The probability there are 5 or more 6s total is borderline, but a higher bid would be risky, and challenging now has a decent chance of success.
