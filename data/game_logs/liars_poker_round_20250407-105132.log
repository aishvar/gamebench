Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening bid and there is no risk of challenge yet, I want to start with a conservative but reasonable bid. In my hand, I have two 8s and two 0s, so bidding 2 8s is safe and leverages my strong count of 8s. It also sets a solid baseline for the round.
