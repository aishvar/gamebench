Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (07460858), I have two 8s and one 0. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. Bidding on 8s seems promising since I have two of them. I'll start with a bid of 3 8s, which is a conservative estimate considering there are 8 digits per player and two players.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. Given there are 16 digits total, the current bid of 3 8s is plausible but not overwhelmingly likely. However, since I hold one 8 myself, it's quite reasonable to expect my opponent to have at least two more 8s. Raising the bid conservatively to 3 9s increases the digit without increasing the quantity, which is a minimal legal raise and keeps pressure on my opponent without overcommitting.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 8 in my hand and no 9s. The bid history shows that Player 0 initially bid 3 8s, and Player 1 raised it to 3 9s. Since I don't have any 9s, I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least three 9s in total. Given that Player 1 made this bid, they might have some 9s, but it's still a relatively high bid considering I have none. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Bidding 4 9s seems too high for me because I don't have any 9s, and it's likely that Player 1 has at most two 9s. However, bidding 3 9s is not an option since it's the same bid. I can bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Bidding 4 0s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity and changes the digit to a lower one, which I have some information about. I have two 0s and 8s, so bidding 4 0s seems like a plausible move. Alternatively, I could challenge, but given that it's not an extremely high bid and Player 1 might have some 9s, I will take a strategic bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (96871133), I have zero 0s. Given that there are 8 digits in the opponent's hand, for the bid of 4 0s to be true, the opponent must have all 4 or more zeros, which is quite unlikely. Since zeros are generally less frequent, and I have none, the probability that there are at least 4 zeros total is low. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
