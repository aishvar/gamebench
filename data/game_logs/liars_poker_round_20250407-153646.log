Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (Random(openrouter/qwen/qwq-32b:nitro)), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Starting with a bid of 3 9s is a common strategic opening in Liar's Poker. The digit 9 is the highest in my hand (two 9s), making it a strong choice. A bid of 3 requires the opponent to have at least one 9, which is plausible but uncertain. This bid balances aggression with defensibility, forcing the opponent to either escalate further or challenge a relatively moderate claim.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 nines. Looking at my hand (18569215), I have one 9. For Player 0's hand to make the bid valid, they would need at least two more 9s, totaling three. The probability of them holding two or more 9s in their eight digits is moderate but not guaranteed. Since three 9s across both hands is plausible but somewhat risky to challenge immediately, a safer strategic move is to increase the bid modestly. The best next bid is 3 tens (i.e., 3 zeros) or 4 of any digit. Since I have no 9s beyond the one, but I do have two 1s (digits: 1, 8, 5, 6, 9, 2, 1, 5), bidding 3 1s is equal, so I must increase quantity or digit. I have two 1s, so bidding 4 1s is a reasonable step. This bid is plausible, pressures the opponent, and avoids an immediate challenge.

--- Turn: Player 0 (Random(openrouter/qwen/qwq-32b:nitro)) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (Random(openrouter/qwen/qwq-32b:nitro)), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. Your hand has no 1s, so the opponent must have all 4. However, the expected number of 1s in a random 8-digit hand is 0.8, making 4+ 1s highly unlikely. Challenging the bid is statistically favorable.
