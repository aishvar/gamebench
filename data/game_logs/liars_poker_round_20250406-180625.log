Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 43562970. I count two 4s, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 2, one 9, and one 7, and one 0. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the most frequent digit in my hand or a digit I have some confidence about. I have two 4s, which is the highest count of any digit in my hand. Bidding on 4s seems reasonable. A quantity of 3 or 4 for the digit 4 could be a good starting point. I'll choose to bid 4 4s as it is a moderate increase and reflects some confidence in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have a lot of information about the other player's hand, I'll play cautiously. I can bid on a higher digit, so I'll consider bidding 4 6s. This is a reasonable increase in digit and is based on my hand having a 6.
