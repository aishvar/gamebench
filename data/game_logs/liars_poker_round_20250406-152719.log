Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (50476378), I see I have two 7s. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative and based on my hand. I have a total of 8 digits, and the most frequent digit in my hand is 7, appearing twice. I will bid 2 7s as my first move, as it reflects my hand's information and is a modest starting bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7. The current bid is 2 7s, so it's plausible assuming the opponent has at least one 7. Since a minimum of two 7s is reasonable, challenging now would be risky. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I don't have many 7s but I do have two 8s, so bidding 2 8s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid. This is a safe incremental bid based on my hand.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (50476378), so the total count of 8s is at least 1 (mine) + 1 (opponent's, assumed from their bid) = 2. The bid is already at 2 8s, and I don't have any information that suggests there are more than 2 eights. Bidding higher seems risky without more information. However, challenging the bid directly might be too aggressive given that the count could realistically be 2. I will bid 2 9s, which is a higher digit and doesn't commit me to a higher quantity, making it a relatively safe move.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 2 9s, so my opponent likely has at least one 9 as well, making the bid plausible. To increase the bid, I can either bid 3 of any digit or 2 of a higher digit than 9, but since 9 is the highest digit, only the quantity can increase. Examining my hand, I have two 8s, so a bid of 3 8s is plausible, as I hold two and it's reasonable to expect my opponent to have at least one 8 among their eight digits. Therefore, bidding 3 8s is a safe and strategically sound move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand, so the total count of 8s is at least 1 (mine) + 1 (opponent's, as they bid 2 8s initially) = 2. It's possible they have more 8s, but bidding higher than 3 8s requires a good reason. I can bid 3 9s, which is a higher digit, or increase the quantity. Since I have a 7 and a 9 in my hand, and the opponent started with 2 7s, I can infer that there are at least 3 sevens or nines. Thus, bidding 4 7s or 3 9s is reasonable. I choose to bid 3 9s as it's a higher digit and seems plausible given the hand and the previous bid history.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 09368517, I have one 9. The current bid is 3 9s, so for that bid to be valid, there must be at least two more 9s in Player 0's hand. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely but not implausible. Instead of challenging now, I can make a higher bid based on my hand. I also have one 8, and since the previous highest bid on 8s was 3 8s, I can safely raise to 4 8s, which is a stronger bid and puts pressure on the opponent.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I know there are at least 2 8s in total (one from my hand and one from the previous bid), bidding 5 8s seems reasonable but risky. Alternatively, I can bid the same quantity with a higher digit, so bidding 4 9s is a valid and safer option. Given that I have two 7s and one 8, and the previous bid was 3 9s, I should consider the likelihood of 9s. Bidding 4 9s is a good choice as it is a valid higher bid and utilizes the information from the previous bids.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 4 9s, meaning there must be at least four 9s across both hands. Since I only have one, the opponent would need to have at least three 9s for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution of digits, it's unlikely that the opponent holds three or more 9s out of their eight digits. Therefore, I believe the current bid is an overstatement and challenging is the optimal move.
