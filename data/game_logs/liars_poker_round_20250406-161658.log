Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 4s, one 0, one 5, one 9, and one 2. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I'll choose a digit I have multiple of—7—and bid 2 7s, reflecting my own hand and leaving room to escalate.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s. Since I have a strong hand with multiple 8s, I can confidently bid higher by increasing the digit to 8, which is higher than 7, while keeping the quantity the same. This puts pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand '75092474', I have zero 8s. Since the current bid is 2 8s, and I have none, it's less likely my opponent has both 8s, though not impossible. A bid of 3 8s would be risky without any in my hand. However, I do have two 7s, so I can safely increase the quantity on 7s to 3, which is a stronger, safer bid given my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. Since I have a strong hand with 8s, I can increase the bid to 3 8s, which is a higher digit than 7s at the same quantity. This seems reasonable given my hand and the current bid.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 7, 5, 0, 9, 2, 4, 7, 4. I have no 8s at all. The current bid is 3 8s, which means my opponent is claiming there are at least three 8s across both hands. Since I have zero 8s, that would require my opponent to have all three 8s themselves, which is unlikely given only 8 digits per player and the distribution of digits. Statistically, three 8s in one hand is a rare occurrence. Therefore, it's probable that the bid is an overstatement, and challenging is the best move.
