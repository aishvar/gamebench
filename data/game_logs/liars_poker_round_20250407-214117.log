--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Starting with the highest digit I have (9) to maximize strategic advantage. I have three 9s, so bidding 4 nines gives a 57% chance of being correct (opponent has at least one 9). This creates pressure while balancing risk, as it's plausible but requires the opponent to either challenge or raise.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, 76123684, there are zero 9s. The current bid is 4 9s, meaning the total across both hands is claimed to be at least 4. Since I have none, all 4 or more 9s would need to be in Player 0's hand. Given that Player 0 only has 8 digits, having 4 or more 9s is possible but somewhat unlikely (probability decreases sharply beyond 3). Without any 9s myself, I suspect this bid might be an overstatement, making a challenge a reasonable strategic move.
