--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand, making it a strong foundation for an opening bid. Bidding 3 9s is a safe and reasonable move since I know the total will be at least three, and it's unlikely the opponent can challenge it successfully without knowing my hand.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (27674102), I have zero 9s. Since the total maximum is 16 digits, and I hold none, the opponent would need to have all 3 or more 9s to make their bid valid. The probability of the opponent having at least 3 out of their 8 digits as 9s is relatively low. Given this, challenging is a strong move here.
