--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 5s, one 1, one 4, one 7, and one 8. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, given I already hold two 5s myself, making it likely or certain the total is at least two.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s. Since I only have one, it's possible the opponent has at least one more 5 to make the bid valid. However, bidding higher is also an option. I have two 6s and two 9s, so bidding 3 6s would be a safe increase.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 5, 8, 1, 4, 3, 7, 3, 5. There are no 6s at all. Since the total number of digits is 16 (8 mine + 8 opponent's), and I hold zero 6s, the entire count of 6s depends on the opponent's hand. For the bid of 3 6s to be valid, the opponent would need at least 3 6s, which is unlikely given the distribution of digits. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
