Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that there's no current bid and I have a diverse set of digits in my hand, I should start with a relatively safe and moderate bid. My hand contains two 5s, two 8s, one 3, one 6, one 0, and one 2. Since I have two of the digit 5 and considering the diversity of my hand, bidding on a digit I have the most of seems strategic. However, to ensure a higher chance of winning, I'll choose a digit that is less likely to be abundant in the other player's hand due to the nature of the game. Given my hand and the aim to start with a bid that is reasonable yet cautious, I will bid on the digit that seems moderately represented in my hand but not overly abundant, keeping in mind the total possible count across both hands could be up to 16 for any digit. Since I have two 5s and two 8s, and considering the need to start with a bid that allows for future strategic maneuvering, I'll choose a bid that reflects my hand's composition while being mindful of the potential distribution in the other player's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (56013299), I have one 5. The current bid is 4 5s, meaning there must be at least three 5s in the opponent's hand for the bid to hold. Since each hand has 8 digits, it's statistically unlikely the opponent has three or more 5s. The expected total number of 5s across both hands is roughly 1.6 (16 digits * 1/10), so 4 is already above expectation. Given this, challenging is strategically sound.
