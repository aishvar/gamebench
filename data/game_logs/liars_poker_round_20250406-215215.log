Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s, one 5, one 6, one 8, one 9, and one 1 in my hand. Given that there are no previous bids, I can start with a reasonable bid. I will bid 2 2s since I know I have two of that digit, which is a safe opening bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze my hand and the current bid to make a strategic decision. My hand is 30417821, which contains one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 7, one 8, and one 0. The current bid is '2 2s'. I can see that I have exactly one 2 in my hand. Since there are only two players with 8 digits each, the maximum possible number of any digit is 16. The opponent has bid that there are at least 2 twos in total. Since I have one 2, this means the opponent must have at least one 2 for their bid to be valid. This is quite possible, so challenging might be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I could bid on a digit I have multiple of, but I don't have multiples of any digit. I'll bid '2 3s' which is higher than '2 2s' because the digit is higher, and I know I have one 3 in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s and one 9, which gives me a decent spread of digits. The current bid is 2 3s. I can bid 3 3s, which is a valid higher bid in terms of quantity and keeps the digit the same. This seems reasonable given my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. In my hand, I have the digits 30417821, which contains only one 3. The current bid is '3 3s', claiming there are at least 3 threes in total between both players. Since I have 1 three, that means Player 0 would need to have at least 2 threes for this bid to be valid. This is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's a risky move this early in the game. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 7, one 8, and one 0. I could bid '3 4s', but I only have one 4 in my hand. A safer option would be to bid '3 7s' or '3 8s' since these are higher digits than 3, making it a valid higher bid. I'll go with '3 7s' as it's a reasonable next step.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s, one 6, one 9, and one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which seems unlikely considering I have no 7s. I can increase the bid to 4 2s, which is a valid higher bid based on my hand composition.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (30417821), I have zero 2s. The current bid is 4 2s, which means my opponent is claiming there are at least 4 2s total between our hands. Since I have zero 2s, all 4 would need to be in my opponent's hand. While this is possible (they could have multiple 2s), it's somewhat unlikely they would have exactly 4 2s out of their 8 digits. Looking at the bid history, they initially bid 2 2s, suggesting they have at least 2. When I bid 3 7s (and I do have one 7 in my hand), they didn't challenge but instead raised to 4 2s, which suggests confidence. However, I think there's still a reasonable chance they're bluffing and don't actually have 4 2s. I'll challenge this bid.
