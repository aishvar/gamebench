--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 9, two 3s, one 0, one 7, one 5, and one 8. A safe opening bid would be 2 of any digit I have at least one of. Starting with 2 3s is reasonable because I already hold two 3s, making the bid very likely true and a solid foundation.
