Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I can make the first bid. I have the digits 0, 8, 4, 1, 3, 1, 9, 0. I notice I have two 1s and two 0s. A reasonable starting bid could be on a digit I have, so I'll bid on 1s. The minimum bid is a quantity of 1, and I have two 1s, so bidding 2 1s seems like a safe and reasonable starting point.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 7, 5, 6, 5, 9, 0, 8, 5. There are zero 1s in my hand. Since the current bid is 2 1s, that would require my opponent to have at least two 1s alone, which is unlikely given the distribution of digits. The expected count of any digit across 16 digits is about 1.6, so 2 1s is a plausible but slightly aggressive opening bid. However, since I have zero 1s, bidding higher on 1s is risky. Instead, I can make a safe higher bid on a digit I hold multiple copies of. I have three 5s, so the total number of 5s is at least 3. Therefore, I can confidently bid 3 5s, which is strictly higher than 2 1s (higher quantity).

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have a lot of 5s, increasing the quantity might be risky. However, I can bid on a higher digit. I have a few options like 3 6s or 3 7s, but I should choose a digit that I have in my hand to make it more believable. I have one 1 and one 9, so bidding 3 9s seems like a safe and reasonable increase in the bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 3 9s, so the opponent would need to have at least two 9s to make that bid valid. Given that the average number of any digit across 16 total digits is around 1.6, having three 9s total is plausible, but not overly likely. However, since I only have one 9, and it's early in the game with bids still relatively low, making a higher bid is a safer strategic move than challenging now. I also have two 5s, so increasing the quantity on 5s to four is a reasonable higher bid supported by my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. My hand is 08413190, which contains one 5 and no digits higher than 5 that would allow me to bid the same quantity with a higher digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 is a viable option. Since I have one 6, and it's likely that the other player might have some 6s, bidding 5 6s seems like a reasonable move as it increases both the quantity and the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 75659085, I have the digits: 7, 5, 6, 5, 9, 0, 8, 5. Counting 6s, I only have one. To satisfy the current bid of 5 6s, there must be at least four more 6s in Player 0's hand, which is unlikely given the distribution of digits. Since 5 is a substantial quantity for a specific digit out of 16 total, and I only have one 6, the bid appears risky. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
