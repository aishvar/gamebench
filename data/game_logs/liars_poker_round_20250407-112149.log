Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (92966779), I have three 9s, two 7s, two 6s, and one 2. Since I have three 9s, that's a strong starting position. I'll bid 3 9s, which I know exist just in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s, and my hand contains no 9s. Since the maximum possible 9s across both hands is 2 (from Player 0's hand), the bid of 3 9s is impossible. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
