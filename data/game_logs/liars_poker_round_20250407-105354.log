Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, there are no 0s (digits are 1,6,7,9,2,9,6,1). Since I have zero 0s, and the opponent bid only 1 0, it's plausible they have one 0, making their bid likely true. There's no reason to challenge such a low and reasonable bid. To increase the bid, I can select a digit I have multiple of. I have two 1s, two 6s, and two 9s. A good next bid is '2 1s', which is strictly higher (same quantity as 1 but higher, so need to increase quantity). So I must bid at least '2 0s' or '1 1s' or higher. '1 1s' is higher than '1 0s' because of digit ordering, but bidding '2 1s' is a safer, more aggressive move based on my hand.
