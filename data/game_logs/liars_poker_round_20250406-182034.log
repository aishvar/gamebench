Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. Given that there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand, and the bid is for at least one 0, it's reasonable to believe there could be at least one 0 in the opponent's hand. A safe and higher bid would be to increase the quantity or the digit. I will increase the digit to make a higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 2s. I can see my hand: 54705998. It contains one '2' (among other digits), supporting the possibility that there could be more '2's or other digits across both hands. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have a '5', and there's a '5' in my hand, bidding 1 5s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit, making the bid higher.
