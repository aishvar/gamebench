Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, so there are definitely at least 2 total 5s. Opening with '2 5s' is a safe bid that cannot be disproven if challenged.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 80324879, I have no 5s. Since the current bid is only 2 5s, it's quite plausible the opponent has two 5s or one 5 and is bluffing. Challenging now is risky. A safe and minimal higher bid would be 2 6s, as I have one 6, or 2 7s, since I have two 7s, making it more plausible. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to 3 of a digit I have multiples of. I have two 7s, so bidding 3 7s is a reasonable escalation, leveraging my hand strength and putting pressure on the opponent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, and I'd like to propose a higher quantity with a digit I hold multiples of. Bidding 4 5s seems reasonable, as I only need two 5s from the other player to meet or exceed that count.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 0 bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 80324879, I have zero 5s. Since I have none, for the bid of 4 5s to be true, the opponent would need to have all four or more 5s, which is unlikely given the distribution across 16 digits. The average count per digit across both hands is around 1.6, so four 5s is a high estimate. Because I have none, challenging is statistically favorable.
