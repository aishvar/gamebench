Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand, which makes bidding on ones a solid opening move. With 16 digits in play and no bid yet, a conservative bid of 2 1s leverages my holding while leaving room to escalate in future rounds.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 54872750. The current bid is 2 1s. I have zero 1s, meaning the opponent must have at least two 1s for their bid to be true, which is possible but not certain for a low bid like this. Challenging is an option, but bidding higher seems safer. I have two 5s and two 7s in my hand. Bidding based on these digits is strong. Bidding '3 5s' requires only one 5 from the opponent's 8 digits, which is statistically likely (average of 1.6 total 5s expected across all 16 digits). This bid leverages my hand (two 5s), increases the quantity from the previous bid, and puts reasonable pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s, but I only have one 5 in my hand. With 8 unknown digits in the opponent's hand, the chance that they have at least 2 additional 5s is very low. Statistically, it's unlikely that there are three or more 5s in total, so the smart move is to challenge.
