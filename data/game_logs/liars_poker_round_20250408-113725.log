Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two 1s, one 5, two 9s, one 0, and one 8 in my hand, I can start with a conservative bid that reflects the digits I have. Bidding 2 1s is a safe starting point based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s, which means Player 1 is suggesting there are at least three 4s in total. Since I only have one, it's unlikely there are two more in Player 1's hand. Challenging seems like the best move.
