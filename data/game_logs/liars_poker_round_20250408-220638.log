Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 2 zeros in my hand, so expecting at least one more across the other player's digits seems reasonable. I'll open with 3 0s as a safe initial bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. My hand has no 0s, so the total count depends solely on Player 0's hand. Challenging a bid of 3 0s is risky but plausible, as having three 0s in an 8-digit hand is relatively unlikely. Betting on their hand having fewer than 3 0s seems reasonable.
