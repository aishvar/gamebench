Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand '81213804', the digit '1' appears twice, '8' appears twice, '0' appears once, '2' appears once, '3' appears once, and '4' appears once. The most frequent digits in my hand are '1' and '8', each appearing twice. Statistically, starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid is best. Bidding '2 1' or '2 8' is safe since I already have two of those digits, and it's likely that the opponent has at least one more, making this bid plausible and setting a solid foundation for the round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (65672099), I see I have 3 '1's and other digits. The current bid is '2 1s'. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have 3 '1's, I can bid higher on '1' or bid on a different digit. Bidding on '1' with a higher quantity seems risky without knowing Player 0's hand, but I can try to bid on a different digit. I have 1 '2', 1 '5', 1 '6', and other digits. A safe bet would be to bid on a digit that I know exists in my hand and is higher than '1'. I choose to bid on '2' since I have one '2' and it's a higher digit than '1'.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 1s'. I need to either make a higher bid or challenge it. Since I have a few 1s in my hand (1, 5, 6, 7, 0, 9, 9, 6), but not enough to confidently make a higher bid on 1s without knowing Player 0's hand, I should consider bidding on a digit that I have multiple of or challenging if I think the bid is unlikely. My hand contains 3 '9's and 2 '6's, among other digits. Given that I have 2 sixes and 3 nines, bidding on '3 6s' or '4 9s' could be strategic, but I must ensure it's higher than the current bid of '2 1s'. Bidding '3 6s' seems reasonable as it's higher in quantity than '2 1s' and involves digits I have.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 sixes. Looking at my hand (81213804), I have zero 6s. Since I have none, for the bid of 3 sixes to be valid, the opponent must have all 3 or more sixes in their hand. Given the distribution of digits, it's relatively unlikely that the opponent holds 3 or more sixes in their 8 digits. Therefore, challenging is statistically favorable here rather than making a higher bid based on no sixes in my own hand.
