Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '8' in my hand, so the current total of 8s is at least one. For Player 0's bid of '2 8s' to be valid, there must be at least one more '8' in their hand. Since each player has 8 digits, and the naive player started with a conservative bid, it's plausible they have at least one '8'. The probability that they hold at least one '8' is fairly high (about 66%) given the binomial distribution (since the expected number of 8s in 8 digits is 0.8). Therefore, challenging now is risky. To raise the bid, the smallest strictly higher bid is either 3 8s or 2 of a higher digit (e.g., 2 9s). I have one '9' in my hand, so bidding 2 9s is roughly as risky as the current bid. Bidding 3 8s requires assuming there are at least two 8s in Player 0's hand, which is less probable. Overall, a conservative but strategic move is to bid 2 9s, which is a minimal raise and keeps pressure on Player 0.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '8' in my hand. The naive opponent has bid that there are at least two 8s total. Given I only have one, it is plausible they have one or more 8s themselves, but since they are naive, they might be guessing or bluffing. The minimum total number of 8s to make their bid true is 2, and I already have one, so it's quite likely there is at least one more in their hand, especially since with 16 digits total, the expected count for any digit is roughly 1.6. The bid of 2 8s is therefore reasonable and not worth challenging. To continue, I need to make a strictly higher bid. The minimal higher bid is 3 8s, but that seems unlikely with only one 8 in my hand. Alternatively, I can bid on a higher digit or a different digit with the same or higher count. Looking at my hand, I have two '4's, so bidding 2 4s is not valid since it is not strictly higher. But I have two '4's, so I can raise to 3 4s, which is a strictly higher bid. Since I already hold two 4s, it is plausible there is at least one more 4 in opponent's hand, making this a reasonable and strategic higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 3/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (86094734), I have exactly one '8'. The naive opponent has bid '2 8s', implying there are at least 2 eights across both hands. Since I only have one, the opponent must have at least one or be bluffing. The total number of digits is 16, so having two 8s is plausible. However, since I have one, it's also quite likely the opponent has one or zero. Because the naive player may overestimate or bluff, challenging now could be profitable. Alternatively, I could make a minimal higher bid like '2 9s', since I also hold one '9', making it plausible. This keeps pressure on the opponent and gathers more information. Given the moderate plausibility of the current bid and my decent hand, a minimal raise is safer than an early challenge.
