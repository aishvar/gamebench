--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand has two 9s. As the first bidder, starting with 2 9s is reasonable since I contribute two, and other players might have additional 9s. This sets a moderate baseline while using a high digit (9) that forces subsequent bidders to increase quantity rather than digit value.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 2 9s, which is reasonable since with 24 digits total, it's quite likely there are at least two 9s among all players. Challenging now is risky. A safe and strategic move is to increase the bid slightly by raising the digit with the same quantity, which is allowed. Since I have two 0s, I will bid 2 0s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit from 9 to 0 wraps around is invalid, so instead, I should increase the quantity). Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 3 and choose a digit I have some confidence in. I have two 2s, so bidding 3 2s is a reasonable incremental raise.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have two 6s and two 8s in my hand. Bidding 4 6s or 4 8s is a reasonable increase in both quantity and digit. Since 4 8s is a higher bid than 4 6s, I will choose to bid 4 8s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand. With 24 total digits (3 players * 8 digits), the current bid of 4 8s would require all 8s to be in the other two players' hands. Given the previous bids (Player 1 bid on 2s, Player 2 bid on 8s) and the statistical improbability of exactly 4 high-value digits like 8s being concentrated among two players, challenging seems prudent. Bidding 4 9s would be risky given I only have two 9s and no visibility into others' hands.
