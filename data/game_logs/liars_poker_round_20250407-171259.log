Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid. My hand is 21709980, containing two 0s, one 1, one 2, one 7, one 8, and two 9s. There are 16 total digits in play (2 players * 8 digits). A safe opening bid is usually low quantity or based on digits I hold multiple of. I have two 0s. Bidding '2 0' is a reasonable opening bid. It reflects my hand, is relatively low, and forces the opponent to make a move. It's plausible that there are at least two 0s across the 16 total digits, especially since I hold both of them.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 0s'. To beat this bid, I need to bid at least '3 0s' or any number of a different digit. I have no 0s in my hand, so bidding '3 0s' is not a viable option. Challenging the bid is risky because the opponent might have the 0s to back up their bid. However, since I have no 0s, it's unlikely that the opponent has two 0s. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
