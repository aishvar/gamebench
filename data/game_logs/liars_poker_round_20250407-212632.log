Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 2s, one 0, one 4, one 5, and one 5. It is generally strategic to start with a conservative bid on a digit I have multiples of. I have two 2s and two 9s, so bidding 2 of either digit is reasonable. Choosing 2 of 2s is a safe opening bid that reflects my hand and leaves room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 twos. Looking at my hand (61360679), I have zero 2s. Since I have none, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least 2 twos. While it's possible, it's somewhat unlikely that the opponent holds both twos. Given that, challenging is a reasonable choice here to catch a bluff or overestimate. Also, making a higher bid without any 2s in my hand is risky and less strategic.
