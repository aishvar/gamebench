Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits: 7, 0, 7, 9, 9, 0, 2, 8. Counting occurrences: two 7s, two 9s, two 0s, one 2, one 8. Opening bids typically favor digits I hold multiple times to increase the likelihood the total count is high. Therefore, I will open with '2 7s' or '2 9s' or '2 0s'. Among these, bidding '2 9s' is strong because nines tend to be less common, making it a safer opening bid. Alternatively, '2 7s' is equally valid. I'll choose '2 9s' as my opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. Since I have no 9s in my hand (my digits are 6, 3, 5, 2, 2, 1, 0, 8), I believe that it's highly unlikely that there are at least 2 nines among both players' hands. Given that I can't make a valid higher bid and the current bid seems implausible, I will challenge it.
