Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s and two 4s. Bidding 2 2s seems reasonable as it's a safe starting point, and I can potentially increase the bid later based on the opponent's response.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit is safer. I have two 6s, so bidding 3 6s is a reasonable option, as it's higher than the current bid and I have some support for it in my hand. Bidding 3 2s would be risky as it relies on my opponent having at least one 2 as well, and I only have one myself.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 6s. Since I only have two 6s, it's unlikely that there are three 6s in total. I should challenge the bid to verify the count.
