Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 2 7s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 7.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 2 8s increases the digit from 7 to 8 while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Since I already hold two 8s, this bid is at least accurate based on my hand.
