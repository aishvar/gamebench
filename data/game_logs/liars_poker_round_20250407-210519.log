Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning we are starting the bidding process. With my hand being '92716005', I can see I have 2 sixes, 2 fives, and other digits appear once or not at all. A safe starting bid would be a digit that appears a significant number of times in my hand but might not be too high to be believable given the maximum possible quantity is 16. The digit '5' appears twice in my hand, which is a relatively high count for a starting bid. I will bid '2 Five' as it's a conservative but higher bid than what could be assumed initially.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my first turn. I should start with a conservative bid to test the waters. I have a 0 in my hand, and given that there are two players, bidding on a digit that appears in my hand seems reasonable. The digit '0' appears once in my hand, so I can start with a bid of '1 zero'.
