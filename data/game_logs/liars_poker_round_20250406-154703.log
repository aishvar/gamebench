Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable bid. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s seems like a safe starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 6.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 8, 1, 9, 4, 3, 8, 4, 1. I have zero 6s. Since I have no 6s, for the bid of 3 6s to be true, the opponent would need to have all 3 or more 6s in their hand, which is unlikely. Given that the total maximum number of 6s is 16, but with zero on my side, the probability that the opponent has at least 3 is low enough to warrant a challenge at this early stage.
