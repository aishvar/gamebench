Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids yet. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 05698841, which contains two 8s and one each of 0, 5, 6, 9, 4, and 1. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. Since I have two 8s, bidding on 8s seems like a good start. I'll bid 3 8s, hoping that the total count across both hands will be at least three.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, and since I don't have any 8s, the total number of 8s depends solely on Player 0's hand. Challenging this bid is a strategic choice to test the validity of their claim, as it's uncertain whether they have enough 8s to meet the bid.
