Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 02896125, containing exactly one '0'. The current bid is '1 0s', meaning there must be at least one '0' in total across both players' hands. Since I already have one '0', this bid is already valid. Given that there are 16 digits total, it's highly likely there is at least one more '0' in the opponent's hand. Therefore, bidding slightly higher is safe. I'll increase the digit to minimize risk, bidding '1 2s', as I already have two '2's in my hand, making this bid very likely to be valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 02896125, containing digits 0, 2, 8, 9, 6, 1, 2, and 5. I have two '2's, which gives me confidence that there are at least two '2's in total. The current bid is only 1 '3', which is very low. Since I don't have any '3's, bidding higher on a digit I'm certain about is safer. I'll increase the quantity to 2 and bid on digit '2', as I already have two of them in my hand, making this a safe and logical bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 02896125, which contains one '2' and no '3's. The current bid is '2 3s', meaning the opponent claims at least two '3's are present among the 16 digits. While I don't have any '3's myself, the opponent could plausibly have two or more '3's. Given that the bid is still very low (only two digits), it's risky to challenge this early. Instead, I should make a conservative higher bid based on digits I'm holding. I have two '2's in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid '3 2s', as only one additional '2' from the opponent's hand is required to meet the bid.
