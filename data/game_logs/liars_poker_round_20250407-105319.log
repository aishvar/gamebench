Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, two 9s, and one each of 3, 5, 6, and 7. A conservative but solid opening bid would be 2 4s, reflecting my own hand and leaving room to maneuver in subsequent rounds.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 63944579, I have two 4s and one 5. The current bid is 2 5s, and since I have one 5, it's plausible that there is at least one more 5 in Player 1's hand, making the bid reasonable. To raise, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I don't have many 5s, but I do have two 4s, so bidding 3 4s leverages my hand strength and is a safe, valid higher bid.
