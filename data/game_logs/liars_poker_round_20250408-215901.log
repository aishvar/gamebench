Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand, so there's a good chance there's at least one more 2 in the opponent's eight digits. Starting with a modest bid of 3 2s seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 95018273, I have one 2. The opponent bid '3 2s', claiming there are at least 3 twos total. Since I only have 1 two, this means they would need to have at least 2 twos in their hand for their bid to be valid. While possible, I can make a safer bid based on what I see in my hand. I see one 7 and one 8, so bidding '3 7s' would be a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit than 2s), and it leaves room for the opponent to potentially have some 7s as well.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have only one 7 in my hand, so the other player would need at least two more 7s to reach a total of 3. That seems unlikely enough to justify a challenge.
