Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two 4s in my hand, I can start with a conservative bid that reflects my hand strength. Bidding 2 4s is a safe initial move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid of 2 4s is risky because I have no 4s in my hand, so I doubt that there are at least 2 fours in total given that the opponent only has 8 digits. Instead of challenging immediately, I can make a safe bid by leveraging my own strong suit: I hold two 6s. Bidding '2 6s' is a valid move (same quantity but with a higher digit than 4) and is backed by my hand, ensuring that if the bid is challenged, I automatically meet the requirement. This bid puts pressure on my opponent while solidifying my position.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s, which is plausible but I can make a higher bid based on my hand. I have two 4s, so I can bid 3 4s, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit reasonable.

Player 0 bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 66521287, which contains no 4s. The current bid is 3 4s, meaning that I would have to hope the opponent has at least three 4s in their 8 hidden digits. Statistically, with an expected count of about 0.8 fours in the opponentâ€™s hand, it's extremely unlikely that there are three or more 4s in total. Given that the chance is very low and the bid is already quite high compared to the expected distribution, I should challenge this bid.
