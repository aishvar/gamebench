Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 8s, two 0s, one 3, one 4, and one 6. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will choose 3 5s, as I have two myself and it's likely there is at least one more in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. I can see that bidding a higher quantity with the same or higher digit than 5 could be advantageous. Alternatively, I could bid the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I have two 6s in my hand, I could consider bidding with a higher digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6. The current bid is 3 6s, so across both hands, there need to be at least two more 6s in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. This is plausible, as two or three of a digit in a single hand is common. Since I can't bid 3 6s again, the next valid bids would be 3 7s or 4 of any digit. I don't have many 7s (none in fact), so bidding 3 7s would be risky. Looking at my hand, I have three 5s, and the previous bid was 3 5s. Since Player 1 raised from 3 5s to 3 6s, perhaps they don't have many 5s, so bidding 4 5s could be a strong move supported by my own count. This would raise the quantity, which is a legal higher bid, and is reasonably supported by my hand.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 3, 1, 1, 6, 3, 1, 9, 7. I have a total of 2 sixes. Considering the bid history and my hand, I can see that bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it is higher than the current bid and I have two 6s in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (58360458), I have zero 6s. The current bid is 5 6s, which requires at least 5 sixes among both hands. Since I have none, all five would have to be in Player 1's hand, which is very unlikely given only 8 digits. The probability of a single hand containing 5 or more of the same digit is quite low. Therefore, challenging is the best strategic move.
