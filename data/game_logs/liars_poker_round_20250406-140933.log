Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids yet. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 66224784, which contains two 6s and two 4s. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. Bidding on a digit I have seems logical. I will bid on 4s, as I have two of them, and it's a relatively safe starting point. I'll bid 3 4s, slightly higher than my own count, considering the total count across all players.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider my hand and the possibility of higher digits or quantities. My hand contains the digits 3, 6, 5, 1, 9, 6, 1, 4. I have two 6s and two 1s, but no 4s or 5s. The current bid of 3 4s seems low, but I should be cautious about overbidding. A reasonable next bid could be to increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 6s, so bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit.

--- Turn: Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '3 6s'. Looking at my hand (50194450), I have zero 6s. This means there need to be at least 3 sixes between the other two players' hands for the current bid to be valid. With 16 digits between them, it's certainly possible they have 3 or more sixes. However, I do have three 4s and two 5s in my hand, which gives me good information. I could bid '4 4s' since I know there are at least 3 in my hand alone. Or I could bid '3 7s' or higher digit, though I have no information about those. Since I know for certain there are at least 3 fours (I have them), bidding '4 4s' seems safest.

Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s, and I need to make a higher bid. I have the hand 66224784, which contains two 4s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have two 4s, I know that there are at least two 4s in play. The bid of 4 4s suggests that the other players might have some 4s as well. I'm not confident that there's a total of more than 4 fours, so I'll increase the digit instead. Bidding 4 5s is a reasonable next step as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have a 5 in my hand, which could contribute to the count. However, without knowing the exact distribution of digits among other players, I must assess the likelihood of the bid being valid or not. Given that I have one 5, and assuming others might have a few 5s as well, the bid seems plausible but I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains a 5, and I see potential for higher bids given the digits I have.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 4s and two 5s in my hand, but no 6s. The current bid is 5 6s, meaning there should be at least 5 sixes across all players. Since I have none, all 5 would need to be between the other two players, which is possible but not guaranteed. Looking at the bid history, Player 1 initially bid 3 6s and has now increased to 5 6s, suggesting they might have several 6s in their hand. However, Player 0 never bid on 6s, instead focusing on 4s and 5s. Given that I have 8 digits and none are 6s, there are 16 other digits between the other players. For there to be 5 sixes, nearly one-third of their combined digits would need to be 6s, which seems somewhat high but not impossible. I'll make a higher bid by increasing to 5 7s, which is reasonable since I haven't seen any bidding on 7s yet, and statistically there should be some 7s in play.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. My hand is 66224784, which contains one 7. This means there are at least 2 more 7s in the other players' hands. The quantity of 5 for 7s is plausible. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 16 digits in the other players' hands and I have one 7, it's possible they have more 7s or other higher digits. I can bid 5 8s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is the better option. My hand contains the digits 3, 6, 5, 1, 9, 6, 1, 4. I have a total of 2 sixes and one 8. Given that the bid is 5 8s, I should consider if I can reasonably make a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent. Since I have two 6s and the bid history shows increasing confidence in higher digits and quantities, I should consider if there's a likely digit that could be bid higher than 5 8s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (50194450), I have two 4s and three 5s, but no 6s. The current bid is '6 6s'. To analyze if this is reasonable, I need to consider the total possible 6s in the game. I have no 6s, so all 6s must be in the other players' hands. For there to be at least 6 of them, the other two players would need to have 6 or more 6s between them, out of their 16 total digits. While possible, this seems somewhat high given the random distribution. Player 1 has now bid on 6s twice (first '3 6s', then '6 6s'), which might indicate they have several 6s. However, the jump from 5 to 6 in quantity seems aggressive. Given I have zero 6s in my hand, and the bid history shows escalating quantities, I think challenging is the better option than making a higher bid like '6 7s' or '7 6s'.
