Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand 49972203, I have two 9s, two 2s, and two 0s. Opening with a conservative bid of 3 2s leverages my two 2s and assumes at least one 2 in the opponent's hand, which is statistically reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. My hand contains one 2, so the opponent needs at least two 2s for the bid to hold. The probability of the opponent having two or more 2s in their 8 digits is low (â‰ˆ19%). Challenging has an 81% chance of success, making it the optimal play.
