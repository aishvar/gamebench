Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have one 7, and bidding 1 7 seems reasonable as a starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding 2 7s is a valid option, but it doesn't significantly increase the risk for the opponent. I could bid a higher digit with a quantity of 1, but that's not a strong bid. Given that the opponent made a very low initial bid, challenging seems reasonable. It's possible they don't have any 7s, and even one 7 in my hand makes the bid plausible, but challenging now puts pressure on them.
