--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 0s, one 2, one 3, one 4, and one 6. A safe opening bid would be 2 8s or 2 0s, reflecting the digits I have multiples of. To avoid revealing too much and to start conservatively, I will bid 2 8s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. Since I have three 5s in my hand (66315575), bidding 3 5s is a valid higher bid (increasing quantity from 2 to 3). This leverages my hand's strength in 5s while ensuring the bid is credible given my own digits.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 6, 2, 8, 9, 3, 4, 0, 8. I have no 5s at all, so the 3 5s bid relies entirely on Player 1 having at least three 5s, which is somewhat unlikely. However, since 3 is a relatively low count out of 16 digits, the bid is plausible. Instead of challenging now, I will raise the bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, based on my two 8s. Bidding 3 8s is reasonable because I have two 8s myself, so only one more is needed in Player 1's hand, which is quite likely.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. My hand has no 8s, so the opponent must have at least three to make the bid valid. Challenging assumes they have fewer than three 8s, which could be risky but plausible if they're bluffing. Bidding higher risks exposing my hand's weaknesses.
