Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. It's reasonable to assume the other player might have at least one more, so I'll open with 3 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 10962851, I have one 7. For the current bid of '3 7s' to be valid, there would need to be at least two more 7s in the opponent's hand. While possible, I can make a safer bid based on what I see in my hand. I see one 8 and one 9 in my hand. Bidding '3 8s' would be a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and seems reasonable given I already have one 8.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I know I have 2 sevens in my own hand. Needing just 2 more sevens among the other 8 unknown digits to reach 4 total seems quite plausible. Increasing the quantity from 3 to 4 also meets the requirement for a higher bid.

Player 0 bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The opponent bid 4 7s, meaning they're claiming there are at least 4 sevens total between our hands. Since I only have one 7, they would need to have at least 3 sevens in their hand for this to be true. While possible, this seems unlikely given they started with a bid of 3 7s and raised it after my 3 8s bid. I could bid higher, but challenging seems more prudent given I can see only one 7 and they're claiming a relatively high count.
