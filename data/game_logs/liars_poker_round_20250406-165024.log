--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 4s. Since the current bid is only 2 4s, it's quite plausible that my opponent has at least two 4s, or there could be one in each hand. Challenging now would be risky. To outbid, I can increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 0s and two 6s, so a safe and natural progression is bidding 2 5s or 2 6s. Since 2 4s is the current bid, the minimal higher bid is 2 5s. Given I have two 6s, bidding 2 6s is reasonable and marginally safer than increasing quantity. Therefore, I will bid 2 6s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I don't have any 6s in my hand. I could bid higher conservatively, like 3 0s, but I think challenging is more likely to be successful since the bid is relatively low and I have no 6s. I will challenge.
