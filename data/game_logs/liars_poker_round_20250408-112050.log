Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I need to make the first bid. My hand has 1,4,6,1,7,2,1,6. Let's count my digits: 1 appears three times, 6 appears twice, and 4,7,2 once each. Since I have three 1s, a safe starting bid could be 3 1s. But considering the opponent might have some 1s, maybe I can bid higher to pressure them. However, starting too high might give away my hand. Bidding 3 1s is a good starting point as it's truthful and sets a baseline.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than this. I have two 3s in my hand, and the total count of 3s could potentially be high. However, I also need to consider the possibility of challenging if I think the bid is unlikely. Given my hand 33700985, I have one 3. If I bid 4 3s, I am increasing the quantity, which seems reasonable given that I have one 3 and there are 8 digits in each player's hand.
