--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, it is my responsibility to open the bidding. Looking at my hand, the digit '6' appears twice, '3' once, '1' once, '5' once, '8' twice, and '9' once. A good opening bid is usually based on a digit I have multiple times, as this increases the likelihood of a safe bid. I have two '6's and two '8's. Opening with a bid of 2 sixes is reasonable and conservative, giving me room to maneuver in future rounds.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s, and I have no 6s in my hand. The likelihood of the opponent having two 6s is uncertain, but challenging a low bid can be risky. However, considering the opponent might be bluffing, challenging could be advantageous.
