Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 7, and one 9 â€” a very even distribution. A safe opening bid is '2 1s' because it's likely there is at least one more 1 in the opponent's hand, making a total of at least two.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 4, 7, 3, 9, 5, 2, 1, 0. I only have one 2. The current bid is 2 2s, so assuming the opponent has at least one 2, the bid is plausible. Since it's still early and a low bid, challenging now is risky. To increase the bid, I can either bid 2 3s or 3 0s (or higher). I have one 0 and one 1, so bidding 3 0s is somewhat aggressive but reasonable given the frequency of zeros in random digits. Therefore, I will raise by quantity to 3 with a digit I hold, choosing 0s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 4, 7, 3, 9, 5, 2, 1, and 0. I have one '1' and one '0'. The current bid is 3 1s. Since I hold one '1', the opponent would need at least two '1's for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution and typical probabilities, it's plausible but not certain. Instead of challenging now, I can safely increase the bid by raising the digit with the same quantity. I also have one '2' and one '0'. Since the previous bid was 3 0s before the 3 1s, I will increase the digit to 3 2s, which is a legal higher bid and keeps the pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 47395210, I have one 3. The current bid is 3 3s, so for that to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least two 3s. Since each player has 8 digits, having three 3s total is plausible but not guaranteed. However, it's early in the game, and a safe strategy is to raise the bid slightly to gather more information. I have two 0s, so bidding 3 4s or 3 5s is riskier, but I do have two 5s, so bidding 3 5s is reasonable. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 4 of a digit I have multiples of. I have two 0s and two 5s, so bidding 4 0s or 4 5s is a reasonable, aggressive move. Since I have two 0s, and zeros tend to appear frequently, I will bid 4 0s, increasing the quantity and making a strong but plausible bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (47395210), I have exactly one '1'. Since the total digits are 16, the bid is that there are at least four '1's in total. Given I only have one, the other player would need at least three '1's for the bid to be valid. This is unlikely because the average count of any digit per player is about 1.6 (16 digits / 10 digits). Without strong evidence or more '1's in my hand, it's statistically improbable there are four or more '1's total. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
