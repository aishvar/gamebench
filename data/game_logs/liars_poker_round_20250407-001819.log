--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 5s, two 0s, one 1, and one 7. A safe yet competitive opening bid would be 2 of one of the digits I have multiples of. I'll choose 2 5s, as I hold two myself, making it likely there are more in total.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s. Bidding 2 6s is a valid higher bid because 6 > 5. Since I already have two 6s, the total count cannot be less than 2, making this bid safe. Challenging the current bid (2 5s) is risky because the opponent likely has at least one 5 to meet the bid (I have one 5 in my hand).

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 6s, so the current bid of 2 6s relies entirely on Player 1 having both 6s or at least one and hoping I have one. With 16 digits total, it's plausible there are two 6s, but unlikely there are significantly more. Since I cannot bid 2 7s (which is only a minimal increase) and have no 6s myself, it would be risky to escalate on 6s. A safe and reasonable move is to increase the bid quantity on a digit I hold many of. I have three 3s, so bidding 3 3s is a valid and stronger bid, increasing the quantity and switching to a digit I have good knowledge of.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 3S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 3s in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s, which requires the opponent to have all three 3s in their 8-card hand. Given the low probability of holding three 3s (estimated ~3.8% chance) and their aggressive bidding pattern (raising to 3 3s after my 2 6s bid), challenging now has a high likelihood of success as their 3s count is likely overstated.
