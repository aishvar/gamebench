Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains the digits 5, 9, 4, 0, 6, 9, 1, 1. I see that I have two 9s and two 1s, and one of each of the other digits. A reasonable starting bid would be to claim 2 of a digit that I have in my hand. I choose to bid 2 5s as a starting point because it's a low digit with a quantity that matches my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, which makes it less likely for there to be many 5s across both hands. However, the current bid of 2 5s is reasonable since there are 16 digits total, and Player 0 may have at least two 5s. Since I cannot challenge at this stage and must make a higher bid, I will bid 2 8s, as I have two 8s in my hand, making this a safe and valid increment in digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 6s, and I see potential to increase the quantity or digit. Since I have two 6s, bidding 3 6s seems reasonable and higher than the current bid of 2 8s.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, which makes the current bid of 3 6s slightly concerning. However, it is possible that Player 0 has at least three 6s between their eight digits. To avoid challenging prematurely, I can raise the bid to 3 8s, as I have two 8s in my hand and it is reasonable to assume there is at least one more 8 between both hands, making this bid plausible.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 5, 9, 4, 0, 6, 9, 1, 1. I have no 8s, which makes it risky to challenge directly without assessing my hand's potential. I can see that bidding 4 or more of any digit seems risky without knowing the distribution, but I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s and the current bid is 3 8s, I can try to bid higher with a digit I have. The bid of 3 6s seems reasonable as I have two 6s, and it's higher than 3 8s in terms of quantity and digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. In my hand, I have no 6s, which makes it less likely that there are at least 4 in total across both players' hands. Given the bidding history, Player 0 seems to be focusing on 6s, but their bids may now be pushing the limits of plausibility. Since I have no 6s and the maximum total is 16 digits, I find it unlikely that there are 4 or more 6s between our hands. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
