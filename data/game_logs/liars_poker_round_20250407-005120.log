Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable bid. I have two 5s and one 6 in my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a safe start, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 5.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 5s. To make a valid higher bid, I can increase the quantity to 4 5s, as it's likely there's at least one more 5 in the other player's hand. This bid is higher in quantity and maintains the same digit.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s and one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s. Since I have two 5s, it is likely that the other player has at least two 5s as well. Therefore, challenging the bid is risky. I should bid 4 6s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 6s. Since I can see two 6s in my hand, it's possible there are at least four 6s in total, but I cannot be certain. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 6s seems reasonable, as it's a plausible number given my hand and the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 5 6s. I can make a reasonable bid of 6 6s, increasing the quantity based on my hand and the likelihood of the opponent having at least one 6.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 6S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand (11681364). The current bid is 6 6s, which means there must be at least three 6s from the other player to reach six in total. Since I already have three, the other player likely has at least three as well, making the total plausible. However, bidding higher would require at least 7 6s, which seems unlikely given the distribution. Instead, I can bid 7 of a different digit I have multiple of, like 1s, to increase the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 1S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 7 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s, one 6, and one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 7 1s. I can't beat this bid with certainty based on my hand. However, 7 1s seems like a reasonable bid, so challenging might not be wise. I should bid with a digit I have more of, like 5s or 9s. Bidding 8 5s is a reasonable move, increasing the quantity while using a digit I have.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 5S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 8 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 5s. In my hand, I have two 5s, and there are 16 digits in total. The maximum possible 5s is 16, but considering my opponent's aggressive bidding, they likely have several 5s. Bidding 9 5s seems risky without more information. However, I can increase the digit to 6, as I have three 6s, making it a safer and higher bid. Bidding 9 6s is a valid move, increasing both quantity and digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 6S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 9 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. It's unlikely that there are 9 6s in total across both hands. Challenging seems like the best move.
