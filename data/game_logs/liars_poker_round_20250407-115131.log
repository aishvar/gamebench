Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand 79707615, I have two 7s and two 0s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I'll start with 2 7s, reflecting my own count and leaving room to escalate.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand (35282384) contains the digits 3, 5, 2, 8, 2, 3, 8, and 4. I have no 7s. The current bid is 2 7s, meaning there must be at least two 7s across both players' hands. Since I have zero 7s, the other player would need to have at least two 7s alone for the bid to be valid. Given that each player has 8 digits, it's plausible but uncertain that the other player has two 7s. However, since the bid is low and plausible, challenging now would be risky. Therefore, it's safer to make a slightly higher bid on a digit I have multiple copies of. I have two 3s and two 8s, so I will bid 3 3s, as it's a digit I already have two of, making it likely that at least one more exists in my opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s and no 3s. The current bid is 3 3s, and since I have zero 3s, I estimate that for the bid to be valid, my opponent must have at least three 3s, which is unlikely given a typical distribution. It's safer to challenge this bid rather than raise it.
