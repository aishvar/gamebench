Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Analyzing my hand '19574358', the digit counts are: 1(1), 9(1), 5(2), 7(1), 4(1), 3(1), 8(1). The digit I have most is '5' with 2 occurrences. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand, I will bid 2 fives, as it is likely there are at least 2 to 3 fives in total across both hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 0, 3, 1, 7, 0, 2, 4, 6. There are no 5s in my hand, so the maximum possible 5s in the game is 8 (assuming the opponent has all 5s). The current bid is 2 5s, which is plausible but likely low. I can make a higher bid to increase the pressure, such as bidding 3 6s, since my hand has one 6 and the opponent could have two more. This is a safe increase in both quantity and digit.

Player 1 bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 sixes. Looking at my hand (19574358), I have zero sixes. That means all three sixes must be in Player 1's hand for their bid to be valid, which is possible but somewhat unlikely given the distribution of digits. Since I have no sixes, I am skeptical Player 1 has all three. Challenging here is a strong move because the probability they hold all 3 sixes is low.
