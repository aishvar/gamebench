Player 0 Reasoning: Since it's the first bid, I should make a reasonable starting bid. My hand contains three 7s. A bid of 'BID: Q 7' (quantity 1, digit 7) seems reasonable as it's likely at least one 7 exists in both hands. It's not overly aggressive, but establishes a starting point. We can't assume the opponent has no 7s, so starting low is better than immediately overcommitting.

Player 0 Reasoning: Since it's the first bid, I should make a reasonable but not overly aggressive bid. I have three 7s in my hand. Bidding 7s seems plausible. I'll bid 2 sevens to start.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given my hand (24382081), I have zero 7s. The current bid is 2 7s, which is possible if Player 0 has at least two 7s in their hand. However, since I have none, the likelihood of Player 0 having exactly two 7s is moderate, but not certain. To play strategically, I can either challenge the bid if I believe it's unlikely or make a higher bid to keep the game going. Since the current bid is relatively low (2 of a digit), it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I can bid on a digit that I have in my hand to increase the chances of the bid being valid. For example, I have two 2s in my hand, so bidding '3 2s' would be a reasonable move, but since the digit must be higher than the current bid's digit (7), I need to bid on a digit higher than 7. The next available digit is 8, which I have one of in my hand. Bidding '3 8s' is a safe move because even if Player 0 has zero 8s, the total would be 1 (from my hand), making the bid invalid, but since the bid is higher in quantity, it's a valid move. Alternatively, I could bid on a higher digit like 9, but I have none in my hand, so that would be riskier. Therefore, the best move is to bid '3 8s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. My opponent bid on 8s after I bid on 7s, suggesting they might have some. However, it's unlikely they have three 8s, as that would be a very strong hand. Bidding 4 8s would be extremely risky. A safer play is to bid on a digit I have a good quantity of - 7s. I have three 7s, and the previous bid was 3 8s. Thus, I can bid 4 7s. This is a valid increase and doesn't require me to challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 2, 4, 3, 8, 2, 0, 8, 1. There are 0 '7's in my hand, so the current bid of '4 7s' would require Player 0 to have all 4 '7's in their hand. Given that the total possible '7's across both hands is 16, it's possible but unlikely that Player 0 has exactly 4 '7's. Since I have none, I think the bid is too high and will challenge it.
