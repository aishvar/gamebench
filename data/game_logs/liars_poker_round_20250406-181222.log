Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current state, I should start with a bid that's likely to be valid. I have 4 digits in my hand that are unique, and 2 digits that are repeated, but none of them are 0. So, I'll bid on a digit that's likely to be present in other players' hands, but not too common. Let's say 3 1s.
