Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s may or may not be true depending on Player 0's hand. Since the minimum bid is very low, it is risky to challenge at this early stage. I should safely increase the bid. Looking at my hand, I have three 8s, which is a strong count. Therefore, I can confidently bid 3 8s, which is strictly higher than 1 0s (higher quantity and digit).

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand, which supports the previous bid of 3 8s. The naive opponent then raised to 3 9s, which is suspicious since 9s are less common and I have zero 9s. Given that the total digits are 16 and I hold none of the 9s, for the bid of 3 9s to be true, the opponent must have all three 9s, which is unlikely. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
