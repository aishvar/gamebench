Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 7s, one 0, one 5, one 3, and one 6. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 7s, as I already hold two 7s myself, making this bid truthful and conservative.
