Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 56385023, which contains 2 fives, 2 eights, 2 threes, 1 six, and 1 zero. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. I have two eights and two fives, making them the most frequent digits in my hand. Bidding on '2 5s' or '2 8s' seems reasonable as it reflects my hand's composition. I'll choose to bid '2 5s' as it's a relatively conservative start.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s, which is relatively low. Given that there are 4 players with 8 digits each, it's plausible that at least one other player has a 5. I can safely increase the bid by raising the digit to 6, which I have two of in my hand, making the bid 2 6s.

Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. The next player bid 2 6s as well, and I know there are 8 digits per player. Given that the bid is low and I have one 6, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have many high digits, I will increase the quantity slightly and bid on a higher digit than 6. I see I have a 7 and several other digits, but not many high digits. A reasonable bid seems to be 3 7s or higher, considering the distribution and my hand.

--- Turn: Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 5, 2, 7, 0, 6, 5, 1, 1. I have one 7, zero 8s, and zero 9s. The current bid is 3 7s. Since I hold only one 7, there would need to be at least two more 7s among the other 24 digits, which is plausible. Bidding 3 8s or 3 9s would be riskier since I have none of those digits. A safer way to increase the bid is to raise the quantity to 4 for a digit I have multiples of. I have two 5s, so bidding 4 5s is reasonable, as there could be at least two more 5s among the other players. Thus, I will bid 4 5s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have the hand 56385023, which contains one 5. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since there are 4 players and each has 8 digits, the total count of any digit across all hands is at most 32. Bidding 5 5s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity, and I have some information about my own hand. However, considering the digit distribution in my hand, I see multiple occurrences of other digits like 5 and 3. I can bid higher on a digit that I know is present in my hand or seems plausible. Bidding 4 6s is a valid option as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit. However, I have one 6, so bidding on 6s might not be very convincing if others have few 6s. I can also consider bidding on a digit that is relatively high and might be less likely to be challenged. Given my hand and the current bid, bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move as it is a higher digit and I have at least one 6.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s, which means there must be at least two more 6s among the other players' hands (since I already have two). Given that there are three other players with 8 digits each, it's plausible that there are at least two more 6s in their combined hands. Therefore, I will make a higher bid by increasing the quantity to 5 6s.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Given that the bid history shows increasing quantities and digits, I should consider if I can make a valid higher bid. Since I have one 6, I can only contribute 1 to the count of 6s. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32, and with 8 digits per player, there are 32 digits in total. The current bid of 5 6s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid with a different digit. I notice I have two 7s and the last bid was 3 7s. I could try to bid higher on 7s or another digit. However, bidding on 7s again might be risky since we already know there are at least 3 7s. I will assess if bidding on a different digit with a higher quantity is more strategic.

--- Turn: Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 5, 2, 7, 0, 6, 5, 1, 1. I have one 7 and one 6, but no 7s beyond that. The current bid is 6 7s, meaning there must be at least six 7s across all 32 digits. Since I only have one 7, the other three players would need to collectively have at least five 7s, which is unlikely given the distribution. Statistically, each digit appears roughly 3 times per player (8 digits x 4 players / 10 digits â‰ˆ 3.2). A count of six 7s is on the high end of plausible, but since I only have one, I suspect the bid is an overreach. Therefore, challenging is the best strategy here.
