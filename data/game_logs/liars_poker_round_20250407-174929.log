Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 60446183. I have two 4s and two 6s. With 16 total digits across both players (2 players * 8 digits), the expected average count for any specific digit is 1.6. Since I hold two 4s, this is slightly above average. As the first bidder, I should make a bid that is reasonably supported by my hand but also plausible for the total count. Bidding 'Three 4s' requires only one 4 from the opponent's 8 digits, which is statistically likely. This bid leverages my hand's strength (having two 4s) while being a relatively safe opening move. Choosing the digit 4 over 6 (where I also have two) leaves more bidding space for subsequent turns.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '3 4s', which means Player 0 believes there are at least 3 occurrences of the digit '4' across both players' hands. My hand contains no '4's, and therefore, I cannot contribute to this count. Given that Player 0's bid is based on a digit that I cannot support, I believe the bid is unlikely to be valid. Therefore, I will challenge it.
