--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 39130522, I have two 2s, two 3s, two 0s, one 1, one 5, and one 9. The most common digits in my hand are 2s, 3s, and 0s. A safe opening bid is '2 2s' because I hold two 2s myself, making it a strong and credible starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand, which allows me to make a higher bid than the current 2 2s. Bidding 3 7s is a safe move as it's based on my known cards and follows the rule of increasing the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 39130522, I have two 2s, one 3, one 9, one 1, one 0, one 5, and one 3. The current bid is 3 7s. Since I have zero 7s, for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need at least three 7s in their hand, which is somewhat unlikely but still possible. However, it's safer to raise the bid conservatively to a more plausible count based on my hand. I have two 2s, so bidding 3 8s or 3 9s would be riskier than bidding 4 2s, since I already hold two of them, and opponent likely has at least two more between their eight digits. So I will increase the quantity and revert to a digit I have good knowledge of.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 2S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 2s in my hand, making the current bid of 4 2s questionable. Challenging is a strategic move as it's unlikely Player 0 has four 2s, considering each player only has 8 digits.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
