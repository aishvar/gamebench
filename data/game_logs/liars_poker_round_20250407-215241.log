--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, the counts of digits are: 8(3), 0(1), 4(1), 2(1), 6(1), 1(1). The most frequent digit in my hand is 8, appearing 3 times. A safe opening bid is to start with 3 of 8s, as I have them in my hand and statistically, the opponent is likely to have at least one more 8, making this a reasonable and conservative opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. It's unlikely that Player 0 has three 8s, given the limited number of cards. Bidding higher would be risky as I have no 8s to support a higher count. Therefore, challenging the bid is the most logical move.
