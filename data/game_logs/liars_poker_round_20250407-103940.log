--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 3s. I don't have any 3s in my hand. I can bid higher to try and bluff, or I can challenge. Since the bid is only 1 3s, it's not a very strong bid. However, since I have no 3s, and the bid is so low, I will raise the bid to 2 4s, as I don't have any 4s either. This is a slightly higher bid, and hopefully will make the other player think I have 4s.
