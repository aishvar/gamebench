Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (08376452), I have a total of 8 digits with one 0, one 8, one 4, two 6s, one 7, one 5, and one 2. I should start with a bid that reflects a reasonable estimate based on my hand and the fact that there are 8 more digits in the opponent's hand. Since I have one 0 and the opponent might have some, bidding '1 0s' seems too low. I have two 6s, so '3 6s' is a reasonable bid considering the opponent might have at least one 6.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, which means there must be at least three 6s between both hands. Since I have zero, my opponent would need to have all three or more 6s, which is quite unlikely given only eight digits. Therefore, it's a good opportunity to challenge this bid.
