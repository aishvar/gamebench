Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a low bid. I have two 3s in my hand, so I can confidently bid at least 2 3s.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. I can see that bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit could be advantageous. Since my hand contains digits, I should consider what I have. I have one 6 and other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. A reasonable next bid could be to increase the quantity or the digit. Given that I have a 6, which is higher than 3, and I can see if I can make a reasonable guess about what Player 0 might have, I could consider bidding 3 4s or higher, but I should be cautious about overbidding.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. I could raise the bid to 4 4s, but that's a small increase. I could also bid 3 of a higher number. I have two 3s and two 9s. Since the last bid was 3 4s, I can bid 3 9s. I will bid 4 0s since I have one 0 in my hand, and it is a safe raise.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 4 zeros in total. Given that I have one 0 in my hand and there are 16 digits in total, if the other player has 3 or more zeros, the bid would be valid. However, I also need to consider the possibility of them having fewer zeros. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider what I have in my hand and what could reasonably be in the other player's hand. I have one 0, and if the other player has 3 or fewer zeros, my bid could be reasonable. However, I also have the option to challenge if I think it's unlikely. Given my hand and the bid history, I should consider a bid that seems plausible but also sets me up well if I choose to challenge later.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. It's possible there are at least five 1s in total, but it's also possible the opponent is bluffing. I could bid higher, but I'll challenge to see if they're bluffing.
