Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make the opening bid. Looking at my hand 84250677, I have two 7s and two 0s, which are the most frequent digits. A conservative but solid opening bid would be 2 7s, reflecting my hand strength and leaving room for escalation.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (from 82096937). The total count of 7s must be at least 2 (one from me and potentially one from the other player), so the bid isn't impossible. However, I can increase the quantity or the digit. I see that I have a 9, so bidding 2 9s is a valid move as it keeps the same quantity but increases the digit. It's a reasonable and safe bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 84250677, I have no 9s, so the current bid of 2 9s relies entirely on the opponent's hand. Since each player has 8 digits, it's plausible the opponent has 2 or more 9s, making a challenge risky. I do have two 7s, which supports the initial bid of 2 7s. To safely increase the bid, I can bid 3 7s, which is a minimal but valid raise, and likely given my two 7s plus potential 7s in opponent's hand.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (from 82096937), so the total count of 7s must be at least 1 (mine) plus the count in Player 0's hand. It's possible Player 0 has two or more 7s, making the bid plausible. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have a 9 in my hand and the previous bid was 2 9s, I can infer that there are at least 3 9s in total (2 previously bid and at least one in my hand). Thus, bidding 3 9s is a valid and reasonable move as it is higher than 3 7s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 84250677, I have two 7s and zero 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, which means there must be at least three 9s across both hands. Since I have none, the opponent would need to have all three or more 9s, which is unlikely given only eight digits in their hand. The probability that they hold three or more 9s is low, making this a good opportunity to challenge the bid.
