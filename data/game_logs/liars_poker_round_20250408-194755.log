Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have certainty of at least one 5 in my hand since it is in my digits. With no bid on the table, a conservative opening bid like 1 5s is safe. It guarantees that if the opponent challenges, I win because I already hold a 5. This sets a modest baseline for the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Bidding 2 5s would be a reasonable bluff, as it's a small increase and my hand doesn't provide any information to support a higher bid on a different digit. It's a low-risk bid, and I'm not confident enough to challenge yet.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold a 5 and a 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s and I have one 5, so while that bid might barely be plausible, challenging it would be risky. Instead, I can make the minimal valid raise by bidding 2 6s since I also have a 6 and this bid only increments the digit, keeping the quantity the same. This keeps the bid in a believable range without overcommitting to a higher quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. The previous bid was 2 5s, and I have no 5s either. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable increase, although I have no 6s. Bidding 3 7s would be a larger increase, but I only have one 7. Bidding 3 0s is also possible, but less likely to succeed. Given the previous bids, increasing the quantity of 6s seems like the most logical approach, even without having any myself.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I only have one 6 in my hand and the current bid requires a total of 3 6s, meaning the opponent would need to have at least 2 of them. With 8 unknown digits and assuming a roughly uniform distribution (about a 10% chance per digit), the probability that the opponent has 2 or more 6s is only around 18-19%. This bid is very unlikely to be true, so I will challenge.
