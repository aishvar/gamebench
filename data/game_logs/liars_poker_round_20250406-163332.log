Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 6s, two 1s, one 2, one 3, and one 9. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, reflecting the two 5s I hold, which sets a modest but credible starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, but I do have two 8s and one 4. The current bid is only 2 5s, which is relatively low. Given my hand, I can reasonably increase the bid to 3 8s since I already have two 8s, and it is plausible that at least one more 8 exists in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 8s, which makes the current bid of 3 8s suspicious. Since I hold 8 digits and none are 8s, there would need to be at least 3 8s entirely in Player 1's hand. The probability of that is low because the expected number of any digit in 8 cards is less than 1 (since 8 digits Ã— 1/10 chance per digit = 0.8). Having 3 or more 8s in one hand is quite unlikely. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
