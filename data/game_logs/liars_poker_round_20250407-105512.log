Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without much risk. I see I have two 7s and two 8s. A bid of '2 8s' seems reasonable as it reflects the number of 8s I have and doesn't overestimate the total count.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have two 8s in my hand, but I also have other digits that could be used to increase the bid. Since the bid quantity is low, I can try to increase it by bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit. I see I have a 9 in my hand, so I can bid a higher digit. Bidding 3 9s seems reasonable, increasing the digit based on my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 7, 2, 8, 6, 0, 2, 4, and 1. I have two 2s, two 8s are not present but I do have one 8 and other digits that could potentially be high. Since I have one 8 and the bid was 3 9s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I have no 9s, so I must focus on a digit I have. The highest digit I can bid on with confidence is 8 since I have one 8 and it's higher than 9. However, bidding 4 8s seems aggressive without knowing the distribution of other digits. I will increase the quantity of 8s as I have one 8 and it seems like a reasonable next bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Since the current bid is already high, I should aim to increase the digit. I have three 9s in my hand, so bidding 4 9s seems reasonable, increasing the digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that this bid can be beaten. My hand contains the digits 7, 2, 8, 6, 0, 2, 4, 1. I have one 9, but I also have two 8s and two other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. The current bid is 4 9s. I could try to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 9 and no information about Player 1's hand, I should consider what I can reasonably bid. I have two 8s, so bidding 5 8s seems possible but I need to verify if it's a valid higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have 2 eights in my hand. Since I have two eights, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity. Bidding 6 8s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 8S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I need to assess if it's likely or not. Given my hand (72860241), I have one 8. My opponent has made a bid of 6 8s, which seems high given that there are only 16 digits in total. I should consider if it's plausible they have 6 or more 8s in total. Since I have one 8 and there are 8 digits in my hand, I should think about the maximum possible 8s my opponent could have. If I assume my opponent has a similar distribution, it's possible but unlikely they have 5 or more 8s. However, without exact knowledge of their hand, I must make an educated guess. Given that I have one 8 and the bid seems high, I will challenge.
