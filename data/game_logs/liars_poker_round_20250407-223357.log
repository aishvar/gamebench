Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have one 6 and other digits, but starting with a low quantity and a moderate digit seems reasonable. I will bid 1 6s as there is at least one 6 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, which allows me to make a higher bid. The current bid is 1 6s, so I can increase both the quantity and the digit by bidding 2 7s. This is a valid and strategic move given my hand composition.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have a 7 in my hand, and I know there are 16 digits in total. Given that I have one 7, and assuming the other player might have some 7s as well, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. My hand contains one 7, so I can confidently bid higher. I will bid 3 7s to increase the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 7s. Since I cannot make a higher bid due to the lack of four of any digit or a higher digit with the same quantity, I must challenge. The likelihood that Player 0 has at least one 7 is uncertain, but without further information, challenging is the most strategic move.
