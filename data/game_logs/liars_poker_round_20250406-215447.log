Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s and two 0s in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, which seems low considering I have multiple digits that could be used to make a higher bid. I can bid 3 4s, which increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a valid and strategic move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. I also have three 8s. I could bid 3 5s, 3 6s, 3 7s, 3 9s, 3 0s, or 4 0s, 4 1s, 4 2s, 4 3s, 4 4s, etc. Since I have three 8s, and the previous bid was 2 8s, I will bid 3 8s. I will bid 4 0s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 0s. Since I can confirm that there are at least 2 0s in my hand, I can safely increase the bid to 5 0s, which is a valid higher bid based on quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have zero 0s in my hand. Given the bid history, it seems like the opponent is trying to bluff. I can increase the quantity to 6 with the same digit to test their resolve, or bid a different digit. I have three 8s. I could bid 6 0s or 3 8s. Since the current bid is 5 0s, I need to bid higher. I'll bid 3 8s, which is lower quantity but a much higher digit than the previous bid of 2 8s, which means I should bid at least 6 0s or 3 9s or higher. I'll bid 6 0s since it's the most direct increase.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, so I know there are at least 2 0s. However, the current bid is 6 0s, which means Player 0 is claiming there are 6 total 0s. Given I only have 2, and considering the maximum digits available, it seems highly unlikely for there to be 6. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
