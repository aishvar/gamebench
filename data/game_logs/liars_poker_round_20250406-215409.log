Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make a valid initial bid. I have a total of 8 digits in my hand, including 1 of each digit from 0 to 9 except for 3 and 5, which I have none of. A reasonable starting bid could be 1 of any digit I have. I choose to bid 1 6, as it's one of the digits I possess.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 6s. Since I know I have two 6s, I can confidently bid higher. I can bid 3 6s, which is a valid higher bid than the current one.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 4 6s is a safe increase. It's possible, and I don't have enough information to confidently challenge.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 6s. Since I have enough 6s to support a higher bid, I can increase the quantity to 5 while keeping the same digit. This is a reasonable move as it reflects my hand and also adheres to the rules of making a higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. It is possible that there are at least five 6s in total, but it's also possible that the other player is bluffing. I will bid slightly higher to test the waters. I will bid 6 6s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which contributes to the total count of 6s. The current bid is 6 6s, and since I have two 6s, I can confidently bid 7 6s, which is a valid higher bid than the current one.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a valid bid, I need to bid higher. I can bid 8 0s, which is a higher quantity and therefore a higher bid regardless of the digit. Alternatively, I can bid 7 of a higher digit, but I don't have enough information to know if that's safe. Bidding 8 0s is a safer option.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 0s, which is quite high considering I have no 0s in my hand. Given that there are only 16 digits total and I have already seen 7 bids of 6s, it seems unlikely that there are 8 0s. I should challenge this bid.
