Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I examined my hand (60840311) and noted that I have two 1s. Given there are 16 digits total and my opponent's 8 digits are random, it is quite plausible that the combined total includes at least two 1s. Therefore, starting with a conservative bid like '2 1s' leverages my known count and sets a realistic baseline for the bidding.
