Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 7s and two 8s. Bidding 2 7s or 2 8s seems reasonable. I will choose to bid 2 8s as it's a good starting point given my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current state of the game. Player 0 has made the opening bid of '2 8s'. Looking at my hand (92147349), I don't have any 8s. Since I don't have any 8s in my hand, and Player 0 has bid that there are at least 2 8s total, those 8s must be in Player 0's and/or Player 2's hands. This is a very low and reasonable opening bid - with 24 total digits in play, it's quite likely there are at least 2 8s across all hands. I should make a higher bid based on what I know is in my hand. I have one 9, one 4, two 3s, one 7, one 1, and one 2. Since I have two 3s, I could bid on 3s. A reasonable bid would be '3 3s' - I know I have 2 of them, so I only need 1 more among the other 16 digits the other players have. This is a very safe bid.

Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have multiple digits, I can analyze the distribution. I see that bidding 3 6s would be a reasonable increase in digit, but I should also consider the likelihood of other players having higher digits. However, bidding 4 3s is also a viable option as it increases the quantity. Given that I have one 3, it's plausible that others might have 3s as well. I'll choose to bid 3 6s as it seems like a safer increase in the bid value.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains a 6, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I see that bidding 4 6s would be a straightforward increase in quantity, but I should also consider if there's a higher digit I could bid on that seems plausible given the hands. However, without knowing the exact distribution of digits among other players, I must make an educated guess. Given that I have one 6 and the bid is 3 6s, I could challenge or bid higher on a different digit. But first, let's assess the risk and potential of increasing the bid on 6s or switching to another digit.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to either make a higher bid than '4 6s' or challenge it. Looking at my hand (92147349), I don't have any 6s. This means there are at most 16 sixes possible in the other players' hands (8 digits per player Ã— 2 players). Player 0 just raised Player 2's bid of '3 6s' to '4 6s', which suggests Player 0 might have at least one 6. However, this isn't a very high bid yet - only 4 out of a possible 24 digits. Since I have two 4s in my hand, I could reasonably bid '5 4s', which would be a higher quantity than the current bid. This seems safer than challenging the current bid of '4 6s', which could easily be true.

Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. My hand is 64263210, which contains one 4. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have information about my own hand, I can see that I have a total of 8 digits, with one 4. The total number of 4s across all hands must be at least 1 (from my hand) but could be more. Given that the current bid is 5 4s, I need to consider if it's likely or not. I will increase the quantity to make a new bid. Bidding 6 4s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 6 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. I have two 4s in my hand, but I don't know if they are enough to make a higher bid. I also have other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. The current bid is quite high, but I can see if I can make a reasonable bid. I have two 4s and two 6s, but I also have two 8s which could be useful. However, bidding 7 or more seems risky without knowing the distribution of digits among other players. I will increase the quantity and bid on a digit I have, which is 4.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand (92147349). The current bid is 7 4s, which means Player 0 believes there are at least 7 fours across all players' hands. Given that I have 2 fours, for this bid to be true, there would need to be 5 more fours between the other two players. Each player has 8 digits, so it's certainly possible. Looking at the bid history, Player 2 previously bid 6 4s, which suggests they might have some 4s in their hand. Player 0 only increased by 1, which could be a cautious move. I could bid 7 5s to increase the digit, or 8 4s to increase the quantity. Since I don't have any 5s in my hand, bidding 7 5s feels risky. I'll bid 8 4s, which is still plausible if the other players have several 4s between them.

Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 8 4s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 4s. My hand contains the digits 64263210, which includes one 4. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. Increasing the quantity to 9 4s seems reasonable as it is a relatively small increase and I have seen the bidding escalate. However, considering the distribution and the fact that there are 24 digits in total, bidding 8 5s (same quantity, higher digit) or 9 4s (higher quantity) are both options. Given that I have seen a lot of bidding on 4s and I myself have one 4, I think 9 4s is plausible. Bidding 8 5s is also a safe option as it doesn't commit to a higher quantity.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 9 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 4s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains 3, 1, 7, 8, 9, 8, 2, and I see that bidding a higher quantity or digit than 9 4s seems challenging without knowing others' hands. However, I can see that there are multiple 4s and 8s in my hand, but no 4s or 6s that could directly compete with or surpass the current bid significantly. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should consider the distribution and my available digits. The current bid is quite high, but I have two 8s which could potentially be useful. I also notice that bidding a higher digit with a similar or slightly higher quantity might be more strategic.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 10 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze whether to challenge the '10 8s' bid or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (92147349), I have zero 8s. The bidding history shows Player 0 started with '2 8s' and has now jumped to '10 8s' after a series of bids on 4s. This is a very large increase and suggests Player 0 might be bluffing. With 24 total digits in play and me having zero 8s, there would need to be 10 8s between the other two players. While possible, this seems unlikely. The previous bidding pattern focused on 4s (which I have two of), but the sudden jump to 10 8s seems suspicious. I'll challenge this bid as it seems too aggressive.
