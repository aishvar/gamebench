Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there has been no bid yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 5s, two 8s, one 4, and one 3. A safe and strategic opening bid is '2 5s' because I hold two 5s, and it's reasonable to assume at least one more 5 might be in the opponent's hand, making future escalation plausible.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 6s, so the likelihood that the total number of 6s across both hands is at least 2 seems plausible but not certain. However, since the current bid is only 2 6s, it's a conservative bid and challenging it now is risky because the opponent likely has at least one 6. To maintain the game flow, I should make a minimal but legal raise. I have two 2s in my hand, so bidding 2 7s (same quantity, higher digit) doesn't leverage my hand. Instead, I can bid 3 2s, which increases the quantity and is supported by my two 2s, making it a reasonable strategic bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 48522853, I have two 2s, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 8, and two 5s. The current bid is 3 3s, and since I only have one 3, for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need at least two 3s, which is plausible but somewhat unlikely. However, I have two 2s, so bidding 3 5s or 3 8s (both of which I have at least one of) is riskier, but I also have two 5s, making a bid of 3 5s a safe increase in digit without increasing quantity. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 4 for digits I have multiples of, like 2s or 5s. Since I have two 2s personally, bidding 4 2s is reasonable, assuming the opponent might have at least two 2s as well. This is a safer and stronger bid than challenging now.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 2S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 1 (Naive 50/50)
Player 1 (Naive) chose to BID: 4 3s
Player 1 (Naive 50/50) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 48522853, I have two 2s, one 3, and no 4s. The current bid is 4 3s. Since I only have one 3, the opponent would need to have at least three 3s for the bid to be valid. This is unlikely, as the average count per digit across 16 digits is about 1.6, and having 4 of a digit is already above average. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
