Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid. I have one 9 in my hand, so bidding 2 9s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 9.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s, so the current bid of 2 9s relies entirely on the opponent having both 9s, which is plausible. However, I have three 0s and two 1s, making it more likely that a higher bid involving these digits would be valid. A natural next move is to increase the quantity to 3 and select a digit I hold multiple of, such as 0. Therefore, bidding 3 0s is both safe based on my hand and a valid raise over 2 9s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s, which is plausible but not guaranteed. I should try to bid higher. I have two 3s in my hand, so bidding 4 3s is a reasonable move, increasing both the quantity and the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 0, 5, 8, 6, 5, 1, 1, 0. I have no 3s at all. The current bid is 4 3s, which would require the opponent to have at least four 3s in their eight digits. While it's possible, it's statistically unlikely for a single hand to contain four or more of the same digit, especially since I have none. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
