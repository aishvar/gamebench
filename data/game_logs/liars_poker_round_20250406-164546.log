Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand (53942457), the digit '5' appears twice, which is the highest count of any digit in my hand. Starting with a bid of '2 5s' is a conservative and reasonable opening move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand (71916286). The opponent bid '2 5s', which means they'd need at least 2 fives in their hand for their bid to be valid. While possible, I can see that I have a strong holding in 6s (one 6). I can make a safe bid of '2 6s' which is valid (higher digit than 5s, same quantity) and I know is true based on my hand alone.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s. Since I only have one, it's possible the opponent has at least one more to make the bid valid. However, bidding higher would require either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have multiple 4s and 5s in my hand, I can make a safer bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 7S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The opponent bid '2 7s', which means they believe there are at least two 7s total between both hands. Since I have one 7, their bid is quite reasonable and likely true. I should continue bidding rather than challenge. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s and one 8, so I could safely bid '2 8s', increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 8S'
Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand (53942457). The current bid is 2 8s, which means Player 1 is claiming there are at least two 8s between both our hands. Since I have none, it's unlikely Player 1 has two 8s in their hand. Challenging seems like the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) challenges Player 1's (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bid of 2 8s.
