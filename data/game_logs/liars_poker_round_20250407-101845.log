Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open with a reasonable starting bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 7s, two 8s, one 1, and one 5. The digits 2, 7, and 8 each appear twice, making them good candidates. Opening with '3 7s' leverages my two 7s and assumes at least one more 7 in the opponent's hand, which is a conservative and reasonable initial bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, so for that to be valid, the opponent must have at least one 8. Since it's quite plausible they have at least one 8 in their eight digits, challenging now would be risky. Instead, I can safely increase the bid by keeping the quantity the same and moving to a higher digit, such as 3 9s, which is a minimal increase and keeps pressure on the opponent.
