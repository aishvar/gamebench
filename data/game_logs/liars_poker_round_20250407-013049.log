Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As this is the opening bid and I have three 9s, two 5s, one 8, and two other digits, a conservative but reasonable opening bid would be 3 9s, leveraging the fact that I already hold three 9s. This sets a solid baseline and puts pressure on the opponent to either outbid or challenge a credible claim.
