Player 0 Reasoning: Since it's the first bid, I should make a reasonable starting bid. I have two 1s, one 2, one 5, one 6, and two 0s. Bidding on 1s seems reasonable. A bid of '1 Q' (quantity 1 of digit 1) is a safe starting point. It's unlikely my opponent has more than 1 or 2 ones, making it a potentially successful bid or a good setup for a challenge later.

Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid. I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 5, one 6, and two 8s. Bidding '1 of 0' is a reasonable opening bid, as it's likely the other player doesn't have many 0s. It's a low risk bid to start with.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. Since I have no zeros in my hand, challenging the bid is a viable option. However, considering the risk and uncertainty of Player 0's hand, making a higher bid on a digit I have might be safer. I bid 1 8s, as I have two 8s, making the bid more likely to be valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. My opponent could have anywhere from 0 to 8 eights. If they have 0 eights, the total is 1. If they have 8 eights, the total is 9. It's possible the bid is valid, but it feels risky to continue bidding higher without more information. I can bid 2 8s, but that feels like throwing money away. Given the initial bid of 1 0s, and my hand containing 0s, I suspect my opponent might be bluffing. Challenging seems like a reasonable play here.
