Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have two 5s in my hand. A conservative starting bid would be 1 5s. However, to be slightly more aggressive and potentially discourage a challenge, I will bid 2 5s. This is a valid first bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, which means I have to rely on the likelihood of the other player having at least two 5s to meet the current bid of 2 5s. Since I don't have any information that suggests the other player has a high number of 5s and considering the bid is relatively low, I should challenge this bid as it seems unlikely that there are at least two 5s in total across both hands.
