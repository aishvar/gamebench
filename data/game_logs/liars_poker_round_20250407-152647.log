Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 25461751, I have: two 1s, one 2, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 7. Since this is the first bid and I have two 1s, making a conservative bid of '3 1s' is reasonable. This assumes the opponent likely has at least one 1 in their hand, which is fairly probable given 8 random digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 6, 8, 3, 3, 4, 3, 0, 7, with no 1s present. The current bid is 3 1s, which requires at least three 1s across both hands (16 digits total). Since I have zero 1s, the opponent must have all three or more 1s for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution and that it's unlikely the opponent has three or more 1s, challenging is the best move.
