Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder and with no current bid, I want to start with a conservative but reasonable opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 7 (two 7s). Since I have two 7s, it's statistically likely there are at least three 7s across both hands. Therefore, a safe opening bid is 3 7s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. Bidding 4 7s is possible, but I'm hesitant to increase the quantity without knowing anything about the other player's hand. Instead, I can bid 3 8s, which is the same quantity but a higher digit, and is a reasonable bid given my hand (which contains a 9). Alternatively, I could bid 4 0s, but that feels less strategically sound.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '17356047', I have zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s. Since I have none, my opponent would need to have all three 8s, which is somewhat unlikely but still possible. Given that 3 is a moderate bid and it's plausible to have three 8s across both hands, challenging might be risky. Instead, I can safely raise to 3 9s, which is a minimal increment that keeps me in the game without committing to a higher quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 4 9s would be risky, as it relies on the opponent having at least two 9s. Bidding a higher digit seems more reasonable. I have two 0s, so bidding 4 0s is a viable option, increasing the quantity. This is a reasonable bid given my hand and the current state of the game.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 17356047, I have exactly one 0. The current bid is 4 zeros, meaning there must be at least three zeros in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. Given a random distribution, the chance of the opponent having three or more zeros among eight digits is relatively low. Since the probability of four or more zeros total is unlikely, I will challenge.
