Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 'None', I have a good chance of making a valid bid. I'll look for the highest digit in my hand to maximize the bid quantity. My highest digit is 8, and I have two 8s in my hand. I can bid 2 8s, which is a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 3 8s would be a reasonable increase, but it doesn't significantly leverage my hand. Bidding 3 9s is also possible, but I don't have any 9s. I have two 3s, so bidding 3 3s is possible. However, I think 2 8s is a plausible bid, and increasing it without more information about the opponent's hand is risky. Therefore, I'll challenge the current bid, as 2 8s seems relatively high given my hand and the limited total number of digits.
