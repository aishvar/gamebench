Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. I have two 2s in my hand. A conservative bid of 2 2s is a good starting point. It's not overly aggressive and establishes a baseline.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 5, 0, 3, 0, 3, 2, 1, 6. There is only one 2 in my hand. Since the current bid is 2 2s, it is plausible that the opponent has at least one 2, making the bid reasonable. To make a higher bid, I can consider the digits I have more of. I have two 0s and two 3s. Bidding 3 0s or 3 3s is reasonable, as I already hold two of each, and only one additional occurrence would be needed in the opponent's hand out of their eight digits. I choose to bid 3 3s, as it strictly increases the quantity and is supported by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. I have two 2s, one 4, one 7, two 1s, one 8, and one 9. I can bid higher than 3 3s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit to 4 would be 3 4s, which is a reasonable bid. Alternatively, I could bid 4 3s, but that's riskier since I have no 3s. Bidding 3 4s seems the safest option given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 50303216, I have the following counts: 0s=2, 1s=1, 2s=2, 3s=2, 4s=0, 5s=1, 6s=1. The current bid is 3 4s, but I have zero 4s, so for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need at least 3 4s themselves, which is unlikely. Since 3 of a specific digit is a reasonable opening bid, but given my zero 4s, the chance that the total is at least 3 is low. Challenging here is strategically sound.
