Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: With no bids yet, I can make any bid. Given my hand contains 8, 4, and 3, I'll start with a bid of 2 3s, as it's a relatively safe and low-digit bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 5, 7, 7, 2, 3, 8, 8, 0. That includes one 3. The current bid is 2 3s, so between both players, there must be at least two 3s. Since I only have one, it's plausible the other player has at least one 3, making the bid believable. To raise, I can either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. I have two 7s and two 8s, making those digits strong candidates for a higher bid. A safe and strategic move is to bid 3 7s, leveraging my two 7s and the chance the opponent has at least one 7, which is reasonable early in bidding.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have a 7 in my hand, but I also have a 6 and a 5, which are higher than 7. I should make a bid that increases the digit to a higher value, like 6 or 5.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 4 7s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, so for that bid to be valid, there must be at least two more 7s in Player 0's hand. While possible, it's unlikely given the distribution across 16 digits. Since 4 of a specific digit is already a strong bid, and I only see two myself, challenging here is prudent rather than risking an overbid.
