Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand, so I know for a fact that there are at least two 3s in play. With no previous bid made, I can start safely by asserting that there are at least 2 3s. This bid is well-supported by my hand and forces my opponent to raise or challenge.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 15929280. I count 1 '3' in my hand. The current bid is 2 3s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 3, it's plausible that the total count of 3s is at least 2 (considering the other player's hand could have at least one 3). However, I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I see that I have two 9s, so bidding on a higher digit is an option. I can bid 2 9s, which is a valid higher bid because the digit is higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 3s in my hand, which gives me confidence in bidding on 3s. The current bid of 2 9s is not outrageous, but I can safely raise the bid by increasing the quantity to 3. With my two 3s, I only need one additional 3 from the opponentâ€™s hand, making '3 3s' a strategic and supported bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. My hand is 15929280, which contains one 2. I can see that there's at least one 3 in the game because Player 0 bid 3 3s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have no information about the count of 3s or higher digits in Player 0's hand, I'll make a conservative bid by increasing the digit. Bidding 3 4s is a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 63249387, which contains one '4'. For the current bid of 3 4s to be valid, the opponent must have at least two additional 4s among their 8 unknown digits. Given that each digit appears with roughly 10% probability, the chance of getting at least 2 fours in 8 cards is around 18-19%, making the bid quite dubious. Therefore, I believe challenging is the safest and most advantageous move.
