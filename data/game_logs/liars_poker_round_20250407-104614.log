Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. In my hand, I have two 5s (digits: 1, 5, 7, 5, 9, 2, 7, 0). A reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, reflecting my hand's strength and putting some pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 1, 5, 7, 5, 9, 2, 7, 0. I have zero 6s. The current bid is 2 6s, which would require both 6s to be in the opponent's hand. This is possible but somewhat unlikely. However, since the bid is low and early in the game, it's safer to raise rather than challenge now. I also have two 5s, so bidding 3 5s is a reasonable and safe increase, leveraging my strong count of 5s.
