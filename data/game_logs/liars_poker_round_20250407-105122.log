Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make the opening bid. My hand contains three 9s, two 8s, and one 3, 3, and 7. A safe and strong opening bid would be 3 9s, reflecting the three 9s I hold, which is a solid base and pressures the opponent to either raise the quantity or digit beyond my known count.
