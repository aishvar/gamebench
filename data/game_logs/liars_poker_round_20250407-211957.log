Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no previous bids, I have the opportunity to start the bidding. My hand contains the digits 0, 2, 3, 6, 1, 7, and 5, so I have a good variety of digits. I will make an initial bid of '1' for the digit '0', as I have one '0' in my hand. This is a reasonable starting point that allows me to gauge the other player's hand and their strategy.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 zero across all 16 digits. Looking at my hand (59745628), I have zero zeros. This means the only zeros in play could be in Player 0's hand. Since they bid 1 zero, it's likely they have at least one zero, making their bid plausible. Challenging now is risky. To continue safely, I should make a minimal valid raise. The next valid bid must be either 2 zeros or 1 of a higher digit. Since I have two 5s in my hand, bidding 1 five is a solid choice, as it's likely there are more across both hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is '1 5s', which means Player 1 claims there is at least one '5' among both players' hands. My hand contains no '5's, and given that there are only 16 total digits (8 from each player), the likelihood of there being one '5' is low, especially since I cannot contribute to that count. Therefore, I will challenge the bid as I believe it is unlikely to be valid.
