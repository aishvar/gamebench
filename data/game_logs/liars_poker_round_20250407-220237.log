Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two 8s in my hand, I can start with a conservative bid that reflects my hand strength. Bidding 2 8s is a safe initial move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 72393465, I have zero 8s. The current bid is 2 8s, which requires at least two 8s across both hands. Since I have none, the opponent would need to have both 8s, which is possible but somewhat unlikely. However, at such a low bid early in the game, it is common to have at least two of any digit across 16 cards. Statistically, each digit appears about 1.6 times on average, so two 8s is plausible. Therefore, challenging now carries a risk. Instead, I should make a safe, minimal higher bid to continue the game. I will increase the bid to 2 9s, since I have two 9s in my hand, making this bid very safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s, which is possible if the opponent has at least one 9. Since I have one, it's plausible they have another. To stay safe, I can increase the bid slightly by increasing the digit to 0, which I have two of in my hand. This makes the bid 2 0s, which is higher than 2 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s, which is plausible but I can increase the bid safely by raising the digit to a higher one that I have more of, like 8. I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding 2 8s is already in the history. Therefore, I should bid 3 8s to increase the quantity.

Player 0 bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 7, 2, 3, 9, 3, 4, 6, 5. I have zero 8s. The opponent's bid is 3 8s, implying there are at least three 8s among all 16 digits. Since I have none, all three would have to be in the opponent's hand, which is unlikely but possible. The probability of the opponent holding three or more 8s is quite low, especially since they initially bid 2 8s and then increased to 3 8s. Given my hand contains zero 8s, challenging is the best strategic move.
