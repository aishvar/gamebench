Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I see one 0. Since there are 8 unknown digits in Player 0's hand, it's quite likely there is at least one more 0, making the current bid of 1 0s very safe. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or the digit. Given I have three 3s and two 4s, a good strategic bid is 2 3s, leveraging my strong count of 3s to create a credible higher bid.
