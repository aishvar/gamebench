Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, so starting with a modest bid of 3 6s seems reasonable for an opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have a 6 in my hand, which makes 1 six so far. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. Given that I do not have enough information about Player 0's hand but know that there are only 16 digits in total, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. I will increase the quantity slightly and choose a higher digit to make a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 2 sixes in my hand, so bidding 5 6s seems plausibleâ€”my opponent could easily have the remaining 3 needed. This is also a valid strictly higher bid than 4 7s (by increasing the quantity).

Player 0 bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have a 6 in my hand, which means there are at least 1 six. The total number of digits in play is 16 (8 from each player). The bid of 5 6s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since I have one 6, and assuming Player 0 has at least 5 or more 6s for their bid to be 5 6s, bidding higher seems risky without knowing the exact distribution. However, I can try to make a higher bid by increasing the quantity or the digit. My hand contains a 7, and I can see if bidding higher on a different digit is strategic.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have only one 7 in my hand. For the total to reach six 7s, the other player would need at least five 7s in their eight digits, which seems highly unlikely. I'll challenge.
