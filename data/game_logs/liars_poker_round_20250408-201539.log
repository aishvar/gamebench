Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 0s (digits: 9, 1, 6, 8, 3, 0, 0, 9). Since the current bid is only 1 0s, and I alone have three, it is very safe to increase the bid. The logical move is to increase the quantity to 3 0s, which is a strictly higher bid and well-supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 91683009, I have no 1s. The current bid is 3 1s, so for that to be valid, the opponent must have at least 3 1s in their hand, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. The typical expected count of any digit across 16 digits is about 1.6. Since I have zero 1s, the chance that the opponent has 3 or more 1s is quite low. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
