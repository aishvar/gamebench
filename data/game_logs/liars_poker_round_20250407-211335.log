Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 97463576. I will count the occurrences of each digit in my hand to decide on a reasonable starting bid. The counts are: 9(1), 7(2), 4(1), 6(1), 3(1), 5(2). I see that I have two 7s, so bidding on '7' with a count of 2 seems reasonable as a starting point, considering there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's, making a total possible count of 16. Bidding '7 D' (7, count of 2) is a conservative start.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so it's the first round of bidding. I need to make an initial bid. My hand is 97463576. I count the digits in my hand: 9 (1), 7 (2), 4 (1), 6 (1), 3 (1), 5 (1), 7 (2), 6 (1). The most frequent digit in my hand is '7' with 2 occurrences. A reasonable initial bid should be related to my hand's characteristics. I will bid on the count of digit '7' with a quantity that reflects its occurrence in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 3/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. My hand is 97463576. I count the digits in my hand: 9 appears once, 7 twice, 4 once, 6 once, 3 once, 5 once. The most frequent digit in my hand is 7, appearing twice. I will bid on the digit that appears most frequently in my hand, which is 7, with a quantity of 2. This is a conservative bid as it reflects the count in my own hand without assuming the count in the other player's hand.
