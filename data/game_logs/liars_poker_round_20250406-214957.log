Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 0s, and one each of 9, 7, 3, 2, and 4. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 1s, reflecting my two 1s, which is conservative yet credible.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, and the current bid is only 2 1s. I can make a higher bid by either increasing the quantity or bidding a higher digit. I will bid 3 9s, which is a valid increase in both quantity and digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '19107324', I have one 9. The current bid is 3 9s, so for that bid to be valid, there must be at least two more 9s in Player 1's hand. Given the distribution of digits, three 9s total is plausible but not guaranteed. Bidding 4 9s would be risky since I only have one 9, and it would require the opponent to have at least three 9s, which is unlikely. Alternatively, I can bid 3 of a higher digit if I have multiple of that digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s. Since the current bid is 3 9s, I can overbid by bidding 3 of a higher digit than 9, but since 9 is the highest digit, I cannot do that. Therefore, the only way to increase the bid is by increasing the quantity, but I don't have enough 9s to justify bidding 4 9s. Hence, the best strategic move is to challenge the current bid.
