Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 8s in my hand, which gives me a strong confirmed count for that digit. With the bidding just starting and no current bid on the table, a conservative yet assertive opening bid is to claim 2 8s. This bid is safe since I already know I have both 8s, and it puts minimal pressure on the opponent while allowing room for future raises.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, which is plausible given that there could be at least one more 8 in the other player's hand. However, I can safely increase the bid by raising the quantity to 3 8s, as this is still within the realm of possibility based on my hand and the total digits in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I know exactly that I hold two 8s. The current bid of 3 8s therefore relies solely on the opponent having at least one 8 among their 8 unknown digits – which happens with about a 57% chance (1 – (0.9^8) ≈ 57%). In contrast, any legal raise (for example, bidding 3 9s or even 4 8s) would force a claim with much lower support from my hand (since for 9s I only have one, and for a quantity of 4 I’d need the opponent to supply two extra 8s – in either case roughly only an 18–19% chance). Given that the current bid is more likely to be valid than any bid I can safely support, my best move is to challenge.
