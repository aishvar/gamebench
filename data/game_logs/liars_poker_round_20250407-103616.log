Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As this is the opening bid and I have two 1s, one 9, one 8, one 5, one 4, and two 0s, I want to start with a conservative but reasonable bid. Typically, opening with 2 of a digit in my hand or 3 total is standard. Since I have two 1s, bidding 3 1s is a safe and credible opening bid, assuming my opponent likely has at least one 1 as well.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 19854019, I have no 2s at all. Since the total number of digits is 16, and I have zero 2s, all three 2s must be in Player 1's hand for their bid of 3 2s to be valid. The probability of Player 1 holding exactly three or more 2s is relatively low, especially since 2s are evenly distributed digits. Given this, it's unlikely the total number of 2s is at least 3, so challenging is the optimal move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
