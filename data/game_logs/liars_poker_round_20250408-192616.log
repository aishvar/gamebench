Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, so I know for sure there are at least two 9s in play. The current bid of 1 0s is very low and can be safely raised. By bidding 2 9s, I strictly increase the bid while using the digit I hold in abundance, putting pressure on my opponent.
