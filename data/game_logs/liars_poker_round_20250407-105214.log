Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, but several high-frequency digits: two 9s, two 4s, two 3s, and two 8s. Since the current bid is very low (only 1 0s), it's trivial to raise. The most strategic move is to increase the quantity to 2 and choose a digit I have multiple of, maximizing the likelihood the bid is valid. I will bid 2 9s, since I hold two 9s myself, making it very likely true.

Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 0s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains three 9s and no 0s. The current bid is 3 0s, which I know is unlikely because I have zero 0s, so Player 0 must have at least three 0s for their bid to be valid. This is improbable given they only have eight digits. Instead of challenging now, I can confidently increase the bid to 4 9s, leveraging my strong count of 9s and putting pressure back on Player 0.

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 5 0s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '98993442', I have zero 0s. The current bid is 5 0s, which requires there to be five zeroes across both hands. Since I have none, all five would need to be in Player 0's hand of eight digits. The probability of five or more zeroes in eight digits is very low (~2.8%). Given this unlikely scenario, challenging is the best strategic move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
