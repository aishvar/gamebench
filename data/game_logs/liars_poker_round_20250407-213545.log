Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand '17694532', I have one '1', one '7', one '6', one '9', one '4', one '5', three '3's, and two '2's. The most frequent digits in my hand are '3' (1 count) and '2' (1 count), but all digits appear once except for '3' and '2'. To start conservatively, bidding '2' of a common digit like '1' or '2' seems reasonable, as it's likely the opponent has at least one of those digits in their hand as well. I'll open with a safe, minimal bid of 2 '1's.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 4, 9, 6, 6, 3, 0, 3, 8. I have zero '1's in my hand. The current bid is 2 '1's, implying there are at least two '1's collectively in both hands. Since I have none, the entire count depends on Player 0's hand. With 8 digits, it's unlikely but possible Player 0 has two or more '1's. However, statistically, it's more probable they have 0 or 1 '1's, making the bid risky. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move.
