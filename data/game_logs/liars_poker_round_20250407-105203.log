Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without risking a challenge. I see I have two 9s in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and I have no information about the other player's hand, a bid of '2 9s' seems reasonable and not easily challengeable.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. Since I have a 9 in my hand, I should increase the quantity or digit to make a valid bid. A reasonable bid is 3 9s, but I can also consider bidding 2 0s since the digit 0 is not yet bid on. However, bidding 2 0s does not take advantage of the digit 9 in my hand, so I'll choose the more confident bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are 8 digits in each player's hand, I should consider the possibility of higher digits or quantities. Since I have one 9, I know there are at least 4 9s in total (3 from the bid history and 1 from my hand). Bidding 4 9s seems reasonable as it's higher than the current bid and takes into account my own digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, made by Player 0. With my hand containing 8 and 6, I have a single digit (8) that could potentially increase the count of the current digit (9). However, this would only be a slight increase. I should consider bidding a higher quantity or digit to make a more impactful bid. Looking at my hand, I notice I have no high digits, but I do have two 6s. If I bid on a digit that is not in my hand, I can increase both the quantity and digit, making my bid more impactful. I see that 8 is not in my hand, but 0 is. I can bid on 0, which is not in the current bid, and increase the quantity to make it a more significant bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are 8 secret digits per player, I should consider the likelihood of there being at least 5 zeros in total. Since my hand does not contain any 0s, I can only rely on Player 1's hand for the count of 0s. I have a relatively high number of 9s in my hand, which could be useful. However, bidding higher than 5 0s requires careful consideration. I can see if I can make a reasonable bid based on my hand or challenge the bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 1S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have 1 one in my hand. Bidding 8 1s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 1S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 8 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s. Given that I have two 1s in my hand (from the digits 92359421, I see two 1s), and considering the bid history, I should assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since my hand contains two 1s and the last bid was 8 1s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I have a total of 8 digits in my hand and none of them are higher than 9 or could significantly increase the count of 1s beyond what seems reasonable given the distribution. However, I can try to bid higher on a different digit. Noticing that I have two 2s and other digits are not as abundant, I could consider bidding on a higher digit with a reasonable quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 2S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 9 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 9 2s, which is the highest bid so far. I should try to increase the quantity or digit to make a higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 1S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 10 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 1s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 9, 2, 3, 5, 9, 4, 2, 1, and 1. I have two 1s and two 9s. The bid of 10 1s seems high but I have to consider if it's possible. Since I have two 1s and my opponent could have at most 8 of any single digit, I need to assess if 10 1s is plausible or not. Given that I have two 1s and there are 16 digits in total, it's possible but seems unlikely given the distribution. However, I do not have enough information to safely assume it's a lie. I should challenge this bid as it seems suspiciously high given the limited number of digits and their distribution.
