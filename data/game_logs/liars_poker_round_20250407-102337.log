Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 9s, and two additional 0s (totaling four 0s). Given that I have four 0s, it's statistically likely there are at least one or two more 0s in the opponent's hand, making a conservative opening bid of 3 0s quite safe and reasonable.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I see two 0s and no 1s. The current bid is 3 1s. Since I have zero 1s, for the current bid to be valid, my opponent must have at least 3 1s, which is unlikely in 8 digits. Therefore, it's reasonable to challenge this bid.
