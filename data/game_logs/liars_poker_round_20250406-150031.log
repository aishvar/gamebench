--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None,' so I can start with any valid bid. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that other players have at least one 6, making the bid plausible but not too conservative.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (53218459), I have zero 6s. Given that I hold none, for the current bid of 4 6s to be valid, there must be at least 4 among the other two players' combined 16 digits. Statistically, expecting 4 or more 6s solely from those hands is unlikely, as the average count per digit across all 24 digits is about 2.4. Since I have zero and the bid is already above average, challenging seems the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
