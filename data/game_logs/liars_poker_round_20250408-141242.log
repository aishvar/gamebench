Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Since I must bid higher, the safest minimal increment is to bid 1 1s (same quantity, higher digit). I have one 1 in my hand, making this bid reasonable and conservative.
