--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. In my hand, I have the digits 4, 6, 9, 6, 0, 2, 8, 7. Counting occurrences: two 6s, one 0, one 2, one 4, one 7, one 8, one 9. A safe and strategic opening bid is '2 6s' as I already hold two 6s, making it very likely true and putting initial pressure on the opponent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s and one 0 in my hand, but no 6s. The current bid is 2 6s. Since I don't have any 6s, I am skeptical about the validity of the current bid. It's possible that Player 0 is bluffing. Given that the total digits are limited to 16, I believe it's unlikely that there are 2 6s. Therefore, I will challenge the current bid.
