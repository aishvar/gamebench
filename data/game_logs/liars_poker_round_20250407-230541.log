Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since there are 16 total digits (8 per player), starting with a bid of 2 9s is safe because even if the opponent has none, my own two 9s meet the bid. This forces the opponent to bid a higher quantity (â‰¥3) or a higher digit (impossible since 9 is the maximum), making their next move riskier.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 14670441. The current bid is 2 9s. I have zero 9s. Challenging a low bid like 2 9s early is risky, even though I hold none. Player 0 would only need two 9s out of their eight digits for their bid to be correct. Instead of challenging, I should make a higher bid. I have three 4s in my hand. Bidding '3 4s' is higher than '2 9s' (same quantity, higher digit). This bid is safe because the total count of 4s across all 16 digits is guaranteed to be at least three, based on my hand alone.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 4s in my hand. The opponent's bid of 3 4s requires them to have at least three 4s in their 8-digit hand. Statistically, the probability of an opponent having three or more 4s in a random distribution is low (~3.8%). Given the low likelihood and my lack of 4s, challenging is the optimal risk-reward decision.
