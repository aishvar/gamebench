Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. The previous bids have been relatively low. I could bid 3 2s, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit. However, since the other player is described as 'Naive 50/50', they may be bluffing. I will bid slightly higher to test the waters. I'll bid 4 2s.
