Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two 3s in my hand, I'll start with a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 2 3s is a safe opening move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (17940881), I have no 3s. The current bid is only 2 3s, which is quite low. Since my opponent might have some 3s and I have two 8s in my hand, I can make a strategic bid of 2 8s. This keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid. I'm confident about this bid since I already know I have two 8s.

Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s and one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s. Since I only have one 8, it's possible the opponent has at least one more 8 to make the bid valid. However, bidding higher would require either increasing the quantity or the digit. I don't have enough information to confidently challenge, so I'll make a conservative bid of 2 9s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (17940881), I have zero 9s. The opponent bid '2 9s', claiming there are at least 2 nines total. Since I have none, this means all claimed 9s would have to be in their hand. While possible, given they've made a relatively conservative bid and I could easily bid higher with my two 8s, I'll continue bidding rather than challenge. I'll bid '3 8s' since I already know I have two 8s in my hand, making this a safe bid that advances both the quantity and the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand (23132930). The current bid is 3 8s, which seems unlikely since there are only 8 digits in the opponent's hand. The probability of them having at least 3 8s is low, especially since I have none. Challenging is the best move here.
