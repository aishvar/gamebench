Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player, I need to make a safe opening bid based on my hand. My hand contains two 7s, which guarantees the total count of 7s across all players is at least 2. Bidding '2 7s' is safe because even if the opponent has zero 7s, the total matches my bid. This prevents an immediate successful challenge and forces the opponent to make a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (24329091), I have 0 sevens. The current bid is '2 7s', meaning Player 0 claims there are at least 2 sevens total between our hands. Since I have 0 sevens, this means Player 0 must have at least 2 sevens in their hand for this bid to be valid. This is entirely possible, as they could have multiple 7s. Given that this is the first bid and it's relatively conservative (only claiming 2 out of a possible 16 digits), challenging would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I can either bid more 7s or switch to a different digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, so I know there are at least 2 nines in the game. I'll bid '2 9s' which is higher than '2 7s' because 9 > 7.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand has 0 nines. The current bid is 2 nines, requiring the opponent to have all 2. Given there's only an 18.7% chance they have â‰¥2 nines (based on binomial probability), challenging offers better odds than making a risky 3-bid that would require opponent contributions.
