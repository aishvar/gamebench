Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s and one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 2 1s, which is quite low given the total of 16 digits. I can confidently bid 3 7s, increasing both the quantity and the digit, which seems reasonable based on my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 4 0s is a safe incremental increase.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have no 0s in my hand, and since the previous bids were 2 1s and 3 7s, it seems unlikely that there are 4 0s in total, especially considering I have digits that are higher than 0. Therefore, I should challenge the current bid.
