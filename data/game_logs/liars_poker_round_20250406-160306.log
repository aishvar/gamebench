Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 72946424. I have three 4s, two 2s, one 6, one 7, and one 9. There are 16 total digits in play (2 players * 8 digits). The expected average count for any digit is 1.6. My strongest holding is three 4s, which is significantly above average. A reasonable estimate for the total number of 4s is my three plus the opponent's expected count (8 digits * 1/10 chance = 0.8), totaling 3.8. Bidding '4 4s' is a strong opening bid based on my hand, assuming the opponent has at least one 4, which is statistically plausible.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 17510933, I have zero 4s. The current bid is 4 4s, which requires at least four 4s across both hands. Since I have none, all four would need to be in Player 0's hand of 8 digits. The probability that Player 0 has four or more 4s is quite low, making the bid unlikely to be valid. Therefore, the most strategic move is to challenge.
