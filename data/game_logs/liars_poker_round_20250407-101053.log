Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so it's unlikely there are many zeros overall. The current bid is minimal (1 0s), so it's very plausible that at least one zero exists in Player 0's hand, making a challenge risky. To safely increase the bid, I should choose a digit I have multiple of. I have two 7s and two 9s. A natural next bid is to increase the digit to 1 9s, which is strictly higher than 1 0s and supported by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 9, 6, 7, 2, 3, 7, 9, 3. I have no 0s, so the current bid of 2 0s depends entirely on Player 0 having both zeros, which is unlikely. Since there are 16 digits total and I see none, the probability Player 0 has two zeros is low. Instead of risking a higher bid on zeros, I can make a safe higher bid based on my strong digits. I have two 9s, so bidding 2 9s (which is equal to my hand count) would be safe, but the previous bid was 1 9s, so I can now bid 2 9s, which is a valid increase over 2 0s (same quantity, higher digit).
