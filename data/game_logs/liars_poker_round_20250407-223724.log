Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. Bidding 3 8s is a higher bid since 8 is greater than 5. This is a strategic move to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is allowed.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand, making the total at least one. Bidding 3 9s is possible but risky since I only have one 9. Challenging the bid is a viable option to test its validity.
