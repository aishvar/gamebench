Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 5s. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 5s, bidding 3 5s is a reasonable option, as it increases the quantity while keeping the same digit. This bid is strictly higher than the current bid and aligns with the digits in my hand.
