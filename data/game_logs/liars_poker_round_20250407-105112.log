Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening bid and I have two 8s and two 9s in my hand, a reasonable conservative starting bid would be 2 8s or 2 9s. Given the choice, bidding 2 9s is slightly better as 9 is a higher digit, making it a stronger opening. This sets a solid baseline and leverages my strong hand in high digits.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s and no 0s. The current bid is 3 0s, which requires at least three zeros across both hands. Since I have zero zeros, all three would have to be in Player 1's hand, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. It is safer to challenge this bid rather than increase it.
