Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have one 1, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 8. Bidding 1 8 seems reasonable as it's a low quantity and a high digit, and I have one 8 in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 1 8s, so there is at least one 8, but likely more in total. Since I can safely assume at least one 8, and possibly more in the opponent's hand, a reasonable next bid would be 2 8s, which is the minimal legal raise (increasing quantity).

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that the bid is low and I have a moderate digit in my hand, I can increase the quantity slightly to test the other player's hand. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity while sticking with a digit that I know exists in the game.

Player 0 bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. Since the current bid is 3 8s, this would require at least two 8s in the opponent's hand to be valid. Given that the average number of any specific digit across 16 digits is about 1.6, having three or more 8s total is plausible but somewhat unlikely. However, it's not improbable enough to warrant a challenge yet. To continue safely, I can increment the bid by raising the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving from 3 8s to 3 9s, since I also hold one 9, making it plausible.

Player 1 bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 1. My hand contains the digits 1, 8, 9, 6, 5, 4, 7, 1. I have one 9 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 9 and the bid is 3 9s, bidding 4 9s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. However, I should also consider if there's a higher digit in my hand that I can bid on. I have an 8 and several other digits but no higher than 9. Bidding 4 9s seems like a safe increase given my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s (digits: 9,8,6,3,1,6,0,7). The current bid is 4 9s, which means there must be at least 4 nines across both hands. Since I hold two, the opponent would need at least two as well. Given the distribution of digits, it's somewhat unlikely they have two or more 9s, making the total at least 4. Therefore, challenging is a reasonable strategy here.
