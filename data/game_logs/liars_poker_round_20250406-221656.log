Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid. I have one 5 in my hand. Bidding 2 5s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 5.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 2 7s increases the digit while keeping the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Since I already have two 7s, this bid is safe as it requires at least two 7s in total, which I already provide. This reduces the risk of being challenged and allows me to continue the bidding.

Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have two 0s and two 5s in my hand. Since I have no 7s, I cannot be certain about the bid's validity. However, bidding 3 5s is a reasonable next step, as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s increases the digit while keeping the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 7s and challenges the opponent to either meet the higher digit or risk a challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand, which makes this bid plausible but not guaranteed. However, I have two 9s in my hand, which is a higher digit. Bidding 4 9s seems like a reasonable next step, increasing the digit and slightly increasing the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. My hand has no 9s, so the opponent must have at least four 9s. With only 8 digits in their hand, having four 9s requires half their digits to be 9s, which seems unlikely unless they specifically hoarded them. Challenging is a calculated risk given the lack of 9s in my hand and the bid's high requirement.
