Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I can make any valid bid. Looking at my hand (6,0,8,9,1,9,5,8), the most frequent digits are 8 and 9, each appearing twice. Starting with a bid of 2 8s is a reasonable opening move, as it's based on the actual count in my hand and leaves room for future bids.

Player 1 response was not valid JSON after cleaning: 'To make a decision, let's analyze the given information:

1. **Your Hand**: 49726783
   - Breaking down your hand: 
     - 4 appears once
     - 9 appears once
     - 7 appears twice
     - 2 appears once
     - 6 appears once
     - 8 appears once
     - 3 appears once

2. **Current Bid**: 2 8s
   - The current bid is on the digit 8 with a quantity of 2.

3. **Your Analysis**:
   - You have one 8 in your hand.
   - The total count of 8s across both players must be at least 2 to satisfy the current bid.
   - Since you have one 8, the other player must also have at least one 8 for the bid to be valid. This is plausible.

4. **Making a Decision**:
   - To make a higher bid, you need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit.
   - Increasing the quantity: Bidding 3 8s is a possibility. You know you have one 8, and it's plausible the other player has more than one 8. However, without strong evidence, significantly increasing the quantity might not be wise.
   - Increasing the digit: You could bid 2 9s. You have one 9, so it's possible the total count of 9s is at least 2, considering the other player might also have a 9.

5. **Choosing an Action**:
   - Your hand has a good distribution but doesn't strongly support a very high bid on any particular digit.
   - The current bid is 2 8s. You can bid 2 9s (since you have a 9, and it's a higher digit than 8), or you can bid 3 8s if you think the other player likely has more than one 8.
   - Bidding 3 8s seems a bit aggressive without more information, but it's a reasonable step up.
   - Bidding 2 9s is a safer increase in the bid because it changes the digit to a higher one without increasing the quantity, and you have one 9 in your hand.

6. **Action Decision**:
   - Let's choose to bid 2 9s. It's a reasonable bid because it increases the digit, and you have at least one 9.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (from 49726783), making it plausible that there are at least 2 eights between us. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about the other player's hand, I'll make a conservative bid by increasing the digit. Bidding 2 9s is a valid higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand (from the digits 60891958). The current bid is 2 9s, which matches the count in my hand alone. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit seems risky without knowing the opponent's hand, but increasing the quantity to 3 9s is a reasonable move given that I already have two 9s and there's a possibility the opponent has at least one more.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 49726783, which contains one 9. So, in total, there are at least two 9s. I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there's no digit higher than 9, I must increase the quantity. Bidding 4 9s is a reasonable next step as it directly increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same.

Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand (60891958). The current bid is 4 9s, which means the opponent is implying there are at least two more 9s in their hand. Given that the maximum possible 9s in the game is 16, but with only 8 digits per player, it's plausible but risky. I could bid higher, but with only two 9s in my hand, challenging seems reasonable as the opponent would need at least two 9s in their hand to make the bid valid. Given the uncertainty, I choose to challenge.
