--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s, and bidding 2 6s seems like a reasonable starting point.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, which means there could be at least 4 6s in total across all players. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit based on my hand. Challenging seems risky because there could plausibly be 2 6s in the other players' hands.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6. The current bid is 4 6s, which means at least four 6s across all 24 digits. Since I only have one, there need to be at least three more among the other two players' combined 16 digits. Statistically, expecting four or more 6s total is plausible but already on the higher side. Given that Player 1 jumped from 2 6s directly to 4 6s, it could be an aggressive bluff. I think the bid is risky and unlikely to hold, so challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 1's (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bid of 4 6s.
