Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two zeros ('0' and '0' in '81519240'), so there are already at least 2 zeros in total. The current bid is only 1 zero, which is certainly true and easy to outbid. Since I know there are at least 2 zeros, I can confidently raise the bid to 2 zeros without risk. This is also a minimal incremental bid, which keeps pressure on Player 0 without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 ones. Looking at my hand (81519240), I have exactly one '1'. Since there are 8 digits in Player 0's hand and Player 0 is naive (50/50), the chance that they have at least one '1' is reasonably high, making the total count of '1's plausibly at least 2. This supports the validity of the current bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid a higher digit with the same quantity. Given my hand, I have two '0's, so a bid of 3 0s is plausible. However, from the bid history, Player 0 moved away from zeroes to ones, possibly indicating they have fewer zeroes. Since I have two zeroes, it's risky to bid 3 zeroes without stronger evidence. Alternatively, I could bid 2 2s, but I have only one '2', so it's less safe. The best strategic move is to raise the quantity on '1's to 3, as I have one '1' and it's likely Player 0 has at least one, making a total of 2 or more, but 3 is less certain. Still, statistically, it's a reasonable aggressive bid to maintain pressure.
