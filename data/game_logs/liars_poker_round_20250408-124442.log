Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s, one 1, one 2, one 4, one 8. Since this is the first bid and I have two 0s, starting with a conservative bid of '3 0s' seems reasonable. There's a good chance my opponent has at least one more 0 in their hand, making this a safe opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. My hand is 67663892, which contains no 0s. Without any 0s in my hand, it's uncertain how many 0s Player 0 holds. However, a bid of 3 0s is relatively low and plausible, as Player 0 may well have several 0s. Challenging this early and low bid seems risky. Instead, I have multiple 6s (three total), making a bid of 3 6s quite safe. Therefore, I'll bid 3 6s, which is higher than the current bid of 3 0s (same quantity, higher digit).

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand, and the opponent chose not to challenge my initial bid of '3 0s', suggesting they likely have at least one 0. Instead, they bid '3 6s', but I don't have any 6s in my hand. For there to be three 6s total, they would need to have all three 6s in their hand, which is possible but somewhat unlikely. Given I know my '3 0s' bid was true and they moved to 6s instead of challenging, I think challenging their '3 6s' bid is the best move.
