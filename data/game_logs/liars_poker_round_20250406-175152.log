Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s. The current bid is only 1 0s, so I know there are at least two 0s total. Since the minimal raise is to either increase the quantity or the digit, the safest and most strategic move is to increase the quantity of 0s to 2, which I can confidently support based on my hand alone.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 3, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 4, 7. This means I have two 1s and one 0. The current bid is 2 1s, which I already fully hold myself, so it is definitely valid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep it the same and increase the digit. Since I have one 0, bidding 3 0s is plausible, as statistically between both hands there could easily be two additional 0s. Therefore, I will raise the bid to 3 0s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '31120247', I have two 1s. Given the current bid is 3 1s, there must be at least one more 1 in Player 0's hand for their bid to be valid. Statistically, with 8 unknown digits, it's plausible Player 0 has at least one 1, making the bid likely valid. Bidding 3 2s is reasonable because I have two 2s, so only one more 2 is needed in their hand, which is probable. This safely increases the digit while maintaining quantity.

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 3s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 31120247, which contains two 1s, two 0s, one 2, one 3, one 4, and one 7. The current bid is 3 3s. Since I only have one 3, for the bid to be valid there would need to be at least two more 3s in Player 0's hand. The probability of that is relatively low, given the distribution of digits. Additionally, Player 0 has been incrementing digits cautiously, and the bid of 3 3s seems like a stretch. It is unlikely there are three or more 3s in total, so challenging is the best move.
