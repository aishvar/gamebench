Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 2s, two 5s, two 6s, and two 7s. I'll start with a bid of one 2.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 2s in my hand, so the opponent must have at least one 2 to support the current bid of 1 2s, which is quite plausible. Since the minimum bid is low and easy to beat, challenging would likely fail. To raise, I can bid 1 3s, which is a higher digit at the same quantity, and I have one 3 in my hand, making this a safe incremental bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 3s. I don't have any 3s in my hand. I can increase the bid to 2 4s. This is a safe bid, as it is only slightly higher than the current bid and doesn't rely on me having many of the bid digit.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 2 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand, I have the digits 4, 3, 9, 3, 7, 2, 6, 8. I possess one 4, which supports the current bid of 2 4s as plausible but not certain. Since the total number of digits is 16, it's quite likely there is at least one other 4 in the opponent's hand, so challenging now would be risky. The minimal safe overbid would be to increase the digit while keeping the quantity, so I will bid 2 5s, which is strictly higher and keeps the pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s. The current bid is 2 5s. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity to 3 5s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 4, 3, 9, 3, 7, 2, 6, 8. I have zero 5s, so the current bid of 3 5s relies entirely on Player 0 holding at least 3 of them, which is somewhat unlikely given random distribution. Since each player has 8 digits, the expected count of any digit is around 1.6, making 3 5s plausible but not probable without strong evidence. I have no 5s, so challenging is reasonable here.
