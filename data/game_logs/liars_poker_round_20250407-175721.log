Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to establish a starting bid. My hand is 72780681. There are 16 digits in total across both players (2 players * 8 digits). The expected average frequency for any digit is 1.6 (16 digits / 10 possible digits). My hand contains two 7s and two 8s, which are my most frequent digits. Bidding '2 7s' is a safe opening bid because I hold exactly two 7s myself. This bid is truthful based solely on my hand and only requires the opponent to have zero 7s for the total count to be met, which is highly plausible. It sets a reasonable starting point for the bidding without revealing too much or being overly aggressive.

--- Turn: Player 1 (quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 sevens. In my hand, I have one 7 (the second digit). Since I only see one 7, for the opponent's bid of 2 sevens to be true, they must have at least one 7 in their hand. This is plausible, as it's common to have at least a couple of any digit across 16 digits total. Therefore, challenging now is risky. The minimal safe move is to increase the bid. I can bid 2 8s, which is a higher digit at the same count. Looking at my hand, I have no 8s, so bidding on 8s is risky. Alternatively, I could bid 3 1s, since I have two 1s (digits 1 and 5), making it plausible there is at least one more 1 in the opponent's hand. Bidding 3 1s is a safe and valid higher bid (increasing the count).

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 72780681. The current bid is '3 1s' made by Player 1. I have one '1' in my hand. This means Player 1 needs at least two '1's in their 8-digit hand for the bid to be true. The expected number of '1's in an 8-digit hand is 0.8. The probability of Player 1 having two or more '1's is relatively low (calculated using binomial probability, it's approximately 18.7%). Therefore, there is a high probability (around 81.3%) that the bid '3 1s' is false. While I could make a safe higher bid like '1 6s', '2 7s', or '2 8s' (since I have one '6', two '7's, and two '8's), the odds strongly favor challenging the current bid.
