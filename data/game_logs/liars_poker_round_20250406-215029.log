Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s, two 2s, and one 4 in my hand. Since there are no previous bids, I should start with a reasonable bid. I can bid 2 0s, which is a safe opening bid given I have two 0s in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 41893638, there are no 0s. The current bid is 2 0s, which implies at least two zeros across both hands. Since I have zero, the entire count depends on Player 0's hand. The probability that Player 0 has two or more zeros in their eight digits is relatively low, roughly around 10-15%. Therefore, it's a reasonable risk to challenge the bid rather than increase it.
