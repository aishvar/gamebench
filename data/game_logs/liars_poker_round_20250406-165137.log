Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 4s and two 9s. I'll bid 3 4s to start.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 4s (digits: 7,5,7,2,3,5,3,4). Since the current bid is 3 4s, and I already hold two, only one more 4 would be needed in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. The probability of them having at least one 4 in their 8 digits is quite high, making a challenge risky. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or the digit. I have three 5s in my hand, so bidding 4 5s (increasing quantity and changing digit) is a strong and safe move based on my hand.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. I could bid 4 6s, but I have two 4s in my hand, and the previous bid was 3 4s. So, I'll bid 5 4s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 4S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 7,5,7,2,3,5,3,4. Counting the 4s, I only have one. The current bid is 5 4s, which means at least 5 total 4s across both hands. Since I only have one 4, the opponent would need to have at least 4 4s, which is quite unlikely given the distribution of digits. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best strategic move.
