Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. I have two 0s, two 6s, one 2, one 3, and two 5s in my hand. A conservative but reasonable starting bid would be 2 0s, as I know I have at least two. It's a low quantity and low digit, making it more likely to be accurate and less risky to defend if challenged later.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 0s. Since there are only 16 digits in total, it's unlikely there are 2 or more 0s in play. I should challenge the bid to verify.
