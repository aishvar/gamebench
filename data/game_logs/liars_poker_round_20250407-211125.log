Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first turn and there have been no bids yet, I need to make the initial bid. Looking at my hand (85762936), I see there are no particularly dominant digits, but I do have two '6's, which is a decent starting point. I will bid conservatively to leave room for escalation, so I will start with '2 6' (indicating there are at least 2 sixes across both hands).

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 sixes. Looking at my hand (8 7 2 1 6 0 1 4), I have exactly one 6. For the bid to be valid, there must be at least two sixes between both hands. Since I only have one, the opponent would need at least one six in their hand. This is plausible, so challenging now is risky. To maintain strategic pressure, I can safely increase the bid by either quantity or digit. The next minimal valid bid is 2 7s (same quantity, higher digit), which is reasonable because I have one 7 in my hand, making it possible there are two total. This is a safe incremental bid that keeps options open.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s, meaning Player 1 believes there are at least 2 instances of the digit 7 across both hands. In my hand, I have one 7. For the bid to be valid, there must be at least one more 7 in Player 1's hand. While this is possible, it's also plausible that Player 1 is bluffing, as they only need to convince me that their bid is reasonable. However, since the bid of 2 7s is not overly ambitious (it doesn't approach the upper limit of 16), it's safer for me to raise the bid rather than challenge at this point. To maintain pressure and explore the strength of Player 1's hand, I will bid 2 9s, which increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 87216014. Counting my digits, I have: one 0, one 1, two 1s (correction), one 2, one 4, one 6, one 7, one 8. Notably, I have zero 9s. The current bid is 2 9s, meaning Player 0 claims there are at least two 9s among both hands. Since I have none, all two 9s would have to be in Player 0's hand. While it's possible they have two 9s, it's statistically unlikely given 8 digits. Given this, challenging is the best move rather than increasing the bid on an unlikely count.
