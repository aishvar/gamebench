Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I see two 0s. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, I can confidently increase the bid to 2 0s, which is a safe and valid higher bid based on my hand.

Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 0, 8, 6, 0, 4, 1, 9, 6, which includes one '1'. The current bid is 2 1s, so for that to be valid, there must be at least one '1' in Player 0's hand. Since it's plausible Player 0 has one '1', I won't challenge yet. The minimal increment would be to bid 2 2s, but I don't know my opponent's hand and 2 2s is less likely than 2 1s. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 3 of a digit I have multiple of. I have two '0's and two '6's. Bidding 3 0s seems reasonable because I already hold two, so only one more is needed in Player 0's hand, which is plausible. Therefore, I will raise the bid to 3 0s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 08604196, I have one '1' and two '0's. The current bid is 3 1s, which requires there to be at least three '1's among all 16 digits. Since I only have one '1', the opponent would need to have at least two more, which is plausible but not highly likely. Before challenging, I consider making a higher bid. I have two '0's, and I previously bid 3 0s, so the opponent likely didn't challenge because they may have at least one '0'. Therefore, a bid of 4 0s is reasonable, as it only requires the opponent to have two '0's, which is plausible. This is a safer and strategic escalation.
