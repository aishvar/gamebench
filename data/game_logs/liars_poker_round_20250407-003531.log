Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s seems like a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 7.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 7s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 7, increasing the quantity to 4 7s is not feasible. However, I can increase the digit to 8 and bid 3 8s, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 7s and one 8 in my hand. Since I have one 8, it's unlikely that there are only three 8s in total. However, bidding higher than 3 8s without more information could be risky. Challenging the bid seems like the best move, as it's likely that the bid is invalid.
