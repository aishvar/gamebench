Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make an opening bid. My hand contains two 5s, which makes it a strategic choice to bid on a digit I have multiple of. Bidding 3 on 5 assumes the opponent has at least one 5, making the total count 3. This is a reasonable opening bid as it's moderate and gives the opponent the option to either raise the bid or challenge if they believe it's too high.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 01342568, containing one '3'. The current bid is '5 3s', made by Player 0. This bid claims there are at least five '3's in total across both players' 16 digits. Since I have one '3', this requires Player 0 to possess at least four '3's in their 8-digit hand. The probability of having four or more of a specific digit (like '3') in an 8-digit hand, assuming random distribution (p=0.1), is statistically very low (approximately 0.5%). Given this low probability, the bid '5 3s' is highly likely to be an exaggeration or a bluff. Therefore, challenging the bid is the most strategically sound action.
