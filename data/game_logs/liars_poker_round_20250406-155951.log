Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, two 0s, and one each of 1, 3, 8, 2, and 4. A safe opening bid is usually two of a digit I have multiple of. Given I have two 6s, bidding 2 6s is a reasonable and conservative opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (82437399), I don't have any 6s. The current bid is 2 6s, which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 2 sixes between both our hands. Since I have zero 6s, this means Player 0 must have at least 2 sixes in their hand for this bid to be valid. This is certainly possible, but I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Since this is the first bid and relatively low (only claiming 2 out of a possible 16 digits), challenging would be risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid based on what I actually have in my hand. I notice I have two 3s and three 9s. I could bid either '2 7s' (increasing the digit) or '3 3s' or '3 9s' (increasing the quantity). I'll go with '3 9s' since I have the most 9s in my hand, giving me confidence in this bid.

Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, making it less likely there are 3 or more 9s across both hands. Since I hold 2 6s, I can confidently raise the bid to 3 6s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, lower digit, so not allowed), or increase quantity. Alternatively, I can bid 4 of any digit I have good count of. I hold two 6s and two 8s. Bidding 4 6s or 4 8s is plausible. Given the prior bid of 2 6s, bidding 4 6s is a natural escalation. This is safer than challenging now, as 3 9s is unlikely but possible. Therefore, I will bid 4 6s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (82437399), I have zero 6s. The current bid is '4 6s', meaning Player 0 is claiming there are at least 4 sixes between our hands. Since I have zero 6s in my hand, all 4 would need to be in their hand. While possible, this seems somewhat suspicious - they would need 4 out of their 8 digits to be 6s. Also, they started by bidding '2 6s', which suggests they might have 2 sixes and are now bluffing. Given this information, challenging seems like the best option.
