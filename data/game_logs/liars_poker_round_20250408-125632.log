Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 41539004, which contains two 4s. Since there is no current bid, I can start conservatively by bidding on a digit I already have multiples of. Bidding 2 4s is safe and reasonable, as I already hold two 4s myself.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity to 3 and choosing a digit that is not likely to be challenged. I will bid 3 5s, as I have one 5 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains one '5', so I contribute one towards the current bid of '3 5s'. Player 1 suggests there are at least two more '5s' between their eight digits. Without additional information, it's plausible that Player 1 has at least two '5s'. Given the uncertainty and the relatively low bid, challenging would be risky. I should instead raise the bid slightly. My hand has two '4s', making it reasonable to bid on '4s'. The previous bid was '2 4s', so I'll increase the quantity to '3 4s', which is strictly higher than the current bid of '3 5s' due to moving up in digit value or quantity. However, '3 4s' would not be a valid bid since it's lower in digit value than '3 5s'. Thus, I must bid either '3 6s' or increase the quantity. Since I have two '0s', bidding '4 0s' seems reasonable, as I already hold two and would only need two more from Player 1's hand, which is plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 5 1s seems like a reasonable increase and uses a digit I have in my hand.

Player 1 bids: 5 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 41539004, which contains exactly one '1'. The current bid is 5 '1's, meaning Player 1 believes there are at least four more '1's in their hand. Given that I only have one '1', Player 1 would need to have at least four '1's out of eight digits, which seems unlikely. Therefore, challenging this bid is the most logical move.
