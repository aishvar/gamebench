Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (53693821), I have two 3s. Bidding 2 3s is the safest and most reasonable starting point, as it's likely to be true and sets a baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (90784259), I don't have any 3s. The current bid is only '2 3s', which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 2 threes between our hands. Since I have no 3s, all of those would have to be in Player 0's hand. This is entirely possible - they could easily have 2 or more 3s. With such a low bid, challenging would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid based on what I know about my hand. I have one 4, one 5, one 7, one 8, one 9 (twice), and one 0. I could bid '2 4s', '2 5s', '2 7s', '2 8s', '2 9s', or '3 9s'. Since I have two 9s in my hand, bidding '3 9s' seems safest as I only need Player 0 to have one more 9 for this to be true. This increases both the digit and the quantity from the current bid.

Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, so the current bid of 3 9s is possible but not certain. I can either bid higher or challenge. Since I have a 9, bidding 4 9s is risky but possible. However, I also have multiple other digits that could support a higher bid. Bidding 4 3s is a safer option, increasing the quantity and leveraging my two 3s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The current bid is '4 3s', meaning Player 0 claims there are at least 4 threes in our combined hands. Looking at my hand (90784259), I don't have any 3s. This means all 4 claimed 3s would need to be in Player 0's hand. While this is possible, it would require Player 0 to have half their hand as 3s, which seems unlikely. They might be bluffing. However, I should consider my options for bidding higher. I could bid '4 4s' (I have one 4), '4 5s' (I have one 5), '4 7s' (I have one 7), '4 8s' (I have one 8), '4 9s' (I have two 9s), or increase the quantity to 5 with any digit. Since I have two 9s in my hand, bidding '5 9s' would mean Player 0 needs to have three more 9s, which is unlikely but possible. I think challenging the '4 3s' bid is my best move since I have zero 3s and it would require Player 0 to have exactly 4 threes.
