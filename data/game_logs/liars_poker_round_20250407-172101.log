Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid, I can start with a relatively safe bid. I have two 1's in my hand. Bidding one of a common digit like 1 is a reasonable starting point. I'll bid one 1.

--- Turn: Player 1 (quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 count of digit '1' across both hands. Looking at my hand (94048896), there are zero '1's. Since I have no '1's, the entire bid depends on Player 0's hand containing at least one '1'. With only 8 digits in Player 0's hand, it's quite possible they have no '1's at all, making the bid risky. Because the bid is at the minimum and I have none, challenging now is a good strategic move.
