--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 4s, two 0s, one 2, one 8, and one 9. A safe opening bid typically involves a digit I have multiple of, to reduce risk. I will start with '3 4s' because I have two 4s myself, and it's plausible that at least one more exists in the opponent's hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 2, 4, 9, 0, 8, 3, 4, 3. I have zero 5s, which makes me skeptical about the current bid of 3 5s. Since I have no 5s, the opponent would need to have all 3 or more 5s, which is possible but somewhat unlikely. However, it's early in the game, and a bid of 3 is quite conservative. Rather than challenging a reasonable bid, I can safely escalate by bidding 3 6s, which is a higher digit but the same quantity, and might pressure the opponent further.
