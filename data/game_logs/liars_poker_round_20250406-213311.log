Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Since I'm the first to bid, I'll choose a digit I have and make a reasonable bid. Bidding 3 8s is a good starting point, assuming the opponent might have at least one 8.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, which requires that my opponent holds at least 3 8s, or that the total number of 8s across both hands is at least 3. Since I have zero 8s, this seems unlikely. The probability of the opponent having all 3 or more 8s in their 8 digits is low. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
