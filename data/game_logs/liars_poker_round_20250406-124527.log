--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. While challenging is an option, it's early in the game. I have two 7s. Bidding 3 7s is a reasonable increase in quantity while using cards from my hand. It's also a different digit, making it less predictable than continuing with 8s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which means Player 1 is implying there are at least two more 7s in their hand or in the remaining digits. With only one 7 in my hand, it's unlikely there are three 7s in total. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
