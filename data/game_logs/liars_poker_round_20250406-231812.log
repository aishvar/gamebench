Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. Since there are 16 total digits across both players, bidding exactly 2 0s is safe because even if the opponent has none, my own two 0s meet the bid. This forces the opponent to either challenge (which they would lose) or make a higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I don't have any 0s in my hand, but I can bid a slightly higher quantity of a different digit. Bidding 3 1s seems like a reasonable increase without being too risky.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand has one 1. The current bid is 3 1s, so the opponent must have at least two 1s for the bid to be valid. With 16 total digits in play and an expected distribution, having exactly two 1s in the opponent's hand is possible but risky to assume. Given the low probability of three 1s across both hands and the opponent's potential bluff after my earlier 2 0s bid, challenging now offers better odds.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) challenges Player 1's (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bid of 3 1s.
