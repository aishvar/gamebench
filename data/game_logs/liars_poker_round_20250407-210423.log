Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I can see my hand contains two 0s, so the bid of '1 0s' is definitely valid and actually quite low. Since I know there are at least 2 zeros in my hand alone, and there could be more in the opponent's hand, I should make a higher bid. A bid of '3 0s' would be conservative and very likely true given I already have 2 zeros and only need 1 more from my opponent's 8 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Let me analyze this carefully: 1) In my hand, I have only one '1', 2) The current bid claims there are 3 '1s' total between both hands, 3) For this to be true, the opponent would need to have 2 '1s' in their hand, 4) Given 8 digits per hand, having 2 '1s' in a random hand is reasonably likely, 5) However, looking at the bid history, the opponent started with a low bid of '1 0s' when I actually have two '0s', suggesting they might not be very well informed, 6) The bid of 3 '1s' seems more like a cautious increment rather than a confident bid based on actually having multiple '1s', 7) Since I can see only one '1' in my hand, and the opponent's bidding pattern suggests uncertainty, I believe the claim of 3 '1s' total is likely too high
