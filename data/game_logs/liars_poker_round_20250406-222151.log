Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I examined my hand (1, 3, 1, 9, 3, 8, 6, 4) and noted I have two 1s, which guarantees that at least two 1s are in play. Since this is the first bid and there is no current bid, I want to start safely with a bid I know is true based on my hand. This sets a solid foundation while leaving room to escalate in later rounds.
