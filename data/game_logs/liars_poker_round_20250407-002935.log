Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, and the current bid is 1 0s. Since I know there are at least two 0s in total (mine plus at least one from the other player), I can safely increase the bid to 2 0s. This is a valid higher bid, increasing the quantity while keeping the same digit.

Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 1s. Since I have no 1s, I cannot confidently bid higher on 1s. However, I can bid on 0s, as I have two 0s and the previous bid on 0s was only 2 0s. Bidding 3 0s is a safe and reasonable move, increasing the quantity.
