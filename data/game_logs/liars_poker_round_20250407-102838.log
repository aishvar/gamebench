Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I see one of each digit except 5 and 9. A conservative but strong opening bid is 2 of a common digit in my hand. I'll choose 2 0s, since I have one 0 and it's likely my opponent has at least one 0 as well.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 76423180, I have one '1' and one '0'. The current bid is 2 1s, which is plausible since I have one and it's likely the opponent has at least one as well. To make a higher bid, I can consider digits I have multiple of. I have two '0's, so bidding 3 0s is a reasonable next move, as it increases the quantity and is based on my hand containing two zeros, making it plausible that at least one more exists in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 76423180, I have one '1'. The current bid is 3 1s, meaning there must be at least three 1s total across both hands. Since I only have one, the opponent would need to have at least two 1s, which is plausible. Instead of challenging now, a safer strategy is to increment the bid with a digit I have more of. I have two '0's, so bidding 4 0s is a reasonable next move, increasing the quantity and switching to a digit I hold more of.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 7, 6, 4, 2, 3, 1, 8, 0. I only have one '1' and one '0'. The current bid is 4 1s, which means there must be at least four '1's among all 16 digits. Since I only hold one '1', the opponent would need to have at least three '1's for the bid to be valid. This is somewhat unlikely given the distribution, as the average count per digit is about 1.6. The previous bids have been escalating between 0s and 1s, but I know I only have one '0' and one '1', so both counts are probably near their limits. It seems risky to increase the bid further without strong evidence, so challenging is the best move.
