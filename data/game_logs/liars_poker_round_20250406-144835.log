Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to set an initial bid. My hand contains two 9s. Bidding 3 9s is a logical starting point because it leverages my existing 9s while leaving room for potential validity. The bid is plausible since there are three other players who might have at least one more 9. Starting with a high digit (9) also limits opponents' options to either raise the quantity or choose a higher digit (which doesn't exist beyond 9).

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. To make a reasonable bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 4 9s is a possibility, but might be too aggressive. I also have a 7, so bidding 3 7s would be lower and therefore invalid. A safe and reasonable bid would be to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Bidding 3 1s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit than 9. I could also bid 4 0s, but I have no 0s in my hand. Therefore, 3 1s is the best option.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 4 9s is a logical next step, as it increases the quantity while maintaining the digit. This is a relatively safe bid given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (84655470), so the total count of 9s is at least 1. Given that there are 4 players and each has 8 digits, the maximum number of 9s is 32. The bid of 4 9s is plausible but on the lower side considering the total possible count. However, it's not extremely high. I need to consider my hand and the likelihood. Since I have no information about other players' hands and the bid is not unreasonably high, I should either challenge or make a slightly higher bid. Given that I don't have a strong presence of a higher digit in my hand and the quantity is already 4, I can either challenge or bid slightly higher. Bidding 5 0s would be a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity and changes the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand '70008714', I have three 0s. Given that the current bid is 5 0s, there would need to be at least two more 0s across the other 24 digits held by the other three players. Statistically, this is plausible, as the average count per digit is roughly 3.2 (32 digits / 10 digits), and 5 0s is not an unreasonable bid. Therefore, challenging now carries a significant risk. To avoid this, I will make a higher bid that is still conservative based on my handâ€”raising the quantity by 1 to 6 0s, which is within the realm of possibility and puts pressure on the next player.

Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. My hand has no 0s, and with 24 remaining digits among other players, the statistical likelihood of 6+ 0s is low (expected ~2.4 zeros in 24 digits). Challenging is likely to win as 6 0s seems improbable.
