Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 4s, one 5, one 7, one 6, and one 0. A reasonable opening bid is to start with a quantity of 2, choosing a digit I have multiple of to increase the chance the total count is higher. I will open with '2 4s' as I have two 4s, making this a safe and conservative opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 4s. It is quite plausible that Player 0 has at least one 4 as well, making the bid reasonable. To maintain pressure and avoid challenging prematurely, I will make a higher bid. I also have three 2s in my hand, so I will bid 3 2s, increasing both the quantity and shifting to a digit I have more of.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 53434576, I have two 4s and no 2s. The current bid is 3 2s, which I cannot confidently challenge because it is plausible that my opponent has at least three 2s combined with my zero. However, since I hold two 4s, a safe and natural higher bid is 3 4s, which matches the quantity but increases the digit, making it a strictly higher bid.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 4s. Based on the bid history, Player 0 seems to believe there are at least three 4s in total. However, I find it more plausible to bid on a digit I have more of, such as 2s. Since I hold three 2s, I can reasonably increase the quantity while switching to a digit I am confident about. Therefore, I will bid 4 2s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 2S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 5, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6. I have zero 2s, so for the current bid of 4 2s to be valid, the opponent must have at least 4 twos, which is quite unlikely given they only hold 8 digits. The probability of having 4 or more of a single digit in 8 digits is low (~6% for exactly 4). Since I have none, the total reaching 4 is improbable, so challenging is the best move.
