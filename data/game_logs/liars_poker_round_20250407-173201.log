Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (None), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I need to initiate the bidding. My hand contains the digits 3 (three times), 7 (twice), 9 (once), 2 (once), and 1 (once). It is strategic to start with a moderate bid to leave room for adjustments in subsequent rounds. I will bid on the digit 3, which is relatively strong in my hand, and start with a quantity of 3.

--- Turn: Player 1 (quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. Looking at my hand (70150105), I have zero 3s. Since I hold half the digits, and I have none, the entire count of 3s depends solely on Player 0's hand. For the bid to be valid, Player 0 would need to have all 3 of the claimed 3s in their 8 digits, which is unlikely because the expected average count of any digit per hand is less than 1. Thus, the probability that Player 0 has 3 or more 3s is quite low. Therefore, it is strategically sound to challenge the bid.
