Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (54094619), I have two 4s and two 9s. Bidding 2 4s or 2 9s would be a safe starting point, but to be more strategic, I'll bid 3 4s, assuming there might be at least one more 4 in the other player's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. I can see that bidding a higher quantity with the same or higher digit than 4 could be advantageous. Alternatively, I could bid the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I have two 6s in my hand, I could make a bid of 4 6s, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which means there are at least two 6s in total. The current bid is 4 6s, which seems plausible given my hand. However, I can increase the quantity to 5 6s, as it's still within the realm of possibility considering the total digits in play. This bid increases both the quantity and maintains a reasonable digit based on my hand.

Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 8 digits in each player's hand, I should consider the likelihood of there being 5 or more 6s in total. Since I have one 6, if I bid higher, I must consider the possibility of Player 0 having more 6s. I will bid higher than 5 6s by increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 6 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 6 6s, which means there must be at least six 6s in total. Given that I only have one 6, the opponent would need to have at least five 6s, which is highly unlikely with only eight digits in their hand. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
