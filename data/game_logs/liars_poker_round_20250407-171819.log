Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 19025743. There are 16 digits in total across both players (2 players * 8 digits each). The expected average count for any specific digit is 1.6 (16 digits / 10 possible digits). I have one '1' in my hand. Bidding '2 1s' is a relatively safe opening bid. It requires the opponent to have at least one '1' in their hand, which is statistically probable. This bid establishes a baseline higher than the absolute minimum ('1 0') while being highly likely to be true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one '1' (from the digit '1'). The current bid is '2 1s', which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least two '1's across both hands. Since I only have one '1', Player 0 must have at least one '1' in their hand for the bid to be valid. However, since I don't know their hand, there's a reasonable chance they might not have any '1's, making the bid unlikely. Therefore, challenging the bid is a strategic move.
