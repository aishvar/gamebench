Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand (digits: 2,8,2,8,0,9,4,1), specifically at positions 3 (0), so one zero, not three. Since I have only one 0, and the opponent made a minimal bid of 1 0s, it's likely there is at least one zero in total, so challenging now is premature. The minimal raise is either increasing the digit with the same quantity or increasing the quantity. I will conservatively raise to 1 1s, which is higher in digit with the same quantity, to maintain flexibility.
