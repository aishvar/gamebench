Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, making it likely there are at least three 8s in total across both hands. Starting conservatively with a bid of 3 8s seems safe and reasonable as the initial bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The current bid is '3 8s', meaning the opponent claims there are at least 3 eights between both our hands. Looking at my hand (34072196), I have zero 8s. Since there are only 8 digits in each player's hand (16 total), and I have none, all 3 claimed eights would need to be in the opponent's hand. This is possible but not guaranteed. I could bid higher, but without any 8s in my hand, I'm uncertain about the distribution. Since this is the first bid and relatively low (3 out of a possible 16 digits), challenging seems risky. I'll make a conservative higher bid based on what I do have in my hand. I see I have one 9, so I'll bid '3 9s', which is higher than '3 8s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 3, 4, 6, 9, 7, 8, 5, and 8. I have exactly one '9' in my hand. The current bid is 3 '9s', meaning Player 1 believes there are at least two more '9s' in their hand. Given each player has 8 digits, it's plausible Player 1 could have two or more '9s', making their bid reasonable. However, I have two '8s' in my hand, and previously I bid '3 8s', which was uncontested. Increasing the bid to '4 8s' is a safer option, as I already hold half of that bid quantity myself, making it a reasonable next move without risking an immediate challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (34072196), I don't have any 8s. The opponent has bid 4 8s, which means they're claiming there are at least 4 8s between our hands. Since I have zero 8s, all 4 would need to be in their hand. While possible, this seems unlikely - they would need to have 4 out of their 8 digits be 8s (50% of their hand). Their initial bid of 3 8s suggests they probably have at least 2-3 8s, but bidding up to 4 suggests confidence. However, I think there's a good chance they're bluffing by increasing to 4. I'll challenge rather than making a higher bid that would be even more difficult to sustain.
