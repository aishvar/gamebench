Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (64883809), I have: two 8s, one each of 6,4,3,0,9. Since this is the opening bid and I have two 8s, making a conservative bid of '3 8s' is reasonable. This leaves room for only one more 8 between both hands while being high enough to be competitive.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 8s. Since there are 16 digits total and I hold 8 of them, the entire bid of 3 8s relies solely on the opponent having at least 3 8s, which is unlikely. The probability of the opponent having 3 or more 8s in their 8 digits is low. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best strategic move.
