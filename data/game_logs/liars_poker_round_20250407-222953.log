Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start by bidding 1 9s. This is a safe move because I know I have at least one 9, and the total count will be at least 1, meeting my bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand (15966027), so I know the current bid of '1 9s' is valid. Since it's a very low bid and I have strong digits like 6 (two of them), I can confidently make a higher bid. Bidding '2 6s' is safe since I already have two 6s in my hand alone.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s, so the total must be at least two if Player 1 has one. Bidding 3 6s is a strategic move, hoping Player 1 has two, making the total three. This increases the quantity from the current bid, making it a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I can see two 6s in my hand (15966027). The opponent bid three 6s total, which means they're claiming there's at least one more 6 in their hand. Given that I can see two 6s myself, this is quite plausible. I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. Since I'm confident about 6s being common, I'll increase the quantity to 4 6s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 1 bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 6s. Considering the total possible 6s, if Player 1 has at least two, the bid is correct. However, without certainty, challenging is a reasonable move to test the bid's validity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) challenges Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022)'s bid of 4 6s.
