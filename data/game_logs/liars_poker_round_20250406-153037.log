Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. I have the digits 2, 9, 7, 1, 8, 8, 3, 6 in my hand. The most frequent digit in my hand is '8' with two occurrences. A reasonable starting bid could be the quantity and digit that I am somewhat confident about. Bidding 2 8s seems like a safe initial bid as it reflects my hand and is a relatively conservative start.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (40819743), I have one 8. The current bid is 2 8s, which is quite plausible given 16 total digits, and I already hold one. Since the minimum next bid must be 3 of any digit or 2 of a digit higher than 8 (i.e., 2 9s), I consider the likelihoods. I have no 9s, so bidding 2 9s is risky. For 3 of any digit, I check my counts: I have two 4s and two 0s, but not three. However, 1s appear twice in my hand, so a bid of 3 1s could be reasonable, assuming the opponent might have at least one 1. This is a safer incremental raise than jumping to 3 8s, which would require me to believe there are at least two more 8s beyond my one. Therefore, I'll increase the quantity and switch to a digit where I have strong representation.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand (29718836). To determine the likelihood of this bid being correct, I need to consider the total count of 1s. I have one 1, so there are 7 remaining digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand. The bid suggests at least 3 1s in total. Since I have one, there need to be at least 2 more 1s in the opponent's hand. It's possible but not certain. I can bid higher to try to make the opponent fold or challenge if I think the bid is too high. Given that I have some information about my hand and the current bid is not extremely high, I can try to bid higher. Bidding 3 2s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit and keeps the quantity the same, making it a relatively safe bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 2S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (40819743), I have one '2'. The current bid is 3 2s, meaning there must be at least three 2s across both hands. Since I only have one, the opponent would need to have at least two 2s for the bid to be true. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely. Additionally, since the bid is only 3, it's a relatively low-risk challenge. Considering the probability and the fact that increasing the bid would be risky without more 2s in my hand, the best move is to challenge.
