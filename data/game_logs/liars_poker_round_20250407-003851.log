Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (10483779), I have two 7s, which is a good starting point. Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid. Given that each player has 8 digits, claiming there are three 7s total is reasonable since I already have two 7s in my hand, and there's a decent chance the opponent has at least one more 7.
