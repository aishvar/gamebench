Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (25214679), I see a distribution of digits. A good starting point is to bid on a digit that appears frequently in my hand. I have two 2s and no other digit appears more than twice. Bidding on 2s seems reasonable. The minimum bid is a quantity of 1 for any digit, but to make a meaningful start, I'll consider bidding on a quantity that reflects my hand. Since I have two 2s, bidding '3 2s' is a reasonable start as it slightly overestimates the count, making it a relatively safe initial bid.
