--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 5s, and one each of 0, 1, 2, and 7. The most frequent digits in my hand are 3 and 5, both appearing twice. A conservative but credible opening bid would be 2 3s or 2 5s. To start with a safe and reasonable bid reflecting my hand strength, I'll bid 2 5s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have one 5 in my hand (since my digits are 6, 7, 4, 3, 2, 4, 8, 9 and none of them are 5). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have any 5s, I will increase the digit to make a new bid. Bidding 2 6s is a valid move as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 6s, so to reach the current bid of 2 6s, the opponent must have at least two 6s. That is plausible. Since I must bid higher, the minimal increment is either 3 0s or 2 7s. I have two 5s and two 3s, so a safe next bid could be 3 5s, leveraging my strong count of 5s. This is a reasonable and strategic increase.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. My hand is 67432489, which contains one 5 and one 4, and other digits not relevant to the current bid. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. I can see that I have a '4', so there is at least one 4. Increasing the quantity to 4 and keeping the digit the same or changing it to a higher or relevant digit could be a strategy. However, my hand doesn't have many high digits, so bidding 4 5s seems like a reasonable and safe increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 3 6s, but my hand doesn't support a strong claim about the number of 6s beyond what's already bid (since I have one 6). Bidding 4 5s is a more informed decision given my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 5s (digits: 5, 3, 3, 5, 2, 7, 0, 1). The current bid is 4 5s, so the opponent is asserting there are at least one more 5 in their hand, which is plausible. Since I hold three 5s already, a total of 4 or even 5 is reasonable. Rather than challenge now, I can safely raise the bid to 4 6s, which is a strictly higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). I have one 6 in my hand (actually none), but since I have no 6s, bidding 4 6s would be risky. Alternatively, bidding 5 5s is plausible because I already have three, and needing two more in their hand is possible but less certain. Given the risk, challenging seems better because 4 5s requires the opponent to have at least one or two 5s, which is plausible, but 5 5s would be a stretch. Therefore, I will challenge the current bid.
