Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. My hand is 50164017. I have two 0s and two 1s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. The expected number of any specific digit across all 16 digits (2 players * 8 digits) is 1.6. Since I have two 1s, bidding '2 1s' is a very safe opening bid, as it's highly likely there are at least two 1s in total. It starts the bidding conservatively.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have no 1s in my hand, but I do have two 8s and two 4s, which are strong numbers to bid on. Since I need to increase the bid, I can raise the quantity and switch to a digit I have. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable choice, as I already hold two 8s, and it's likely that at least one additional 8 exists in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. My hand is 50164017, which contains zero 8s. For the current bid to be true, the opponent must have at least three 8s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of having 3 or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is low (approximately P(k>=3 in B(8, 0.1)) â‰ˆ 3.8%). Since I have no 8s, the probability of the bid being correct is very low. Potential higher bids like 4 0s (I have two 0s, opponent needs >=2) or 4 1s (I have two 1s, opponent needs >=2) are more plausible than 3 8s, but challenging 3 8s has a much higher probability of success (approx 96.2%). Therefore, challenging is the statistically strongest move.
