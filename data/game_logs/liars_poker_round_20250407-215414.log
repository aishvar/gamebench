--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand (38704829), the counts of digits are: 0 (1), 1 (0), 2 (1), 3 (1), 4 (1), 5 (0), 6 (0), 7 (1), 8 (2), 9 (1). The digit with the highest count is 8, appearing twice. A safe opening bid is usually 2 of a digit I hold multiple times, so I will bid '2 8' (two eights), which is a reasonable starting point given I hold two 8s and there could be more in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s, which is a relatively low bid. Given the large number of players and the possibility that other players may have multiple 8s, I should challenge the current bid to prevent a potentially high total from being established.
