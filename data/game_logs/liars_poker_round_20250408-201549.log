Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 36286947, which contains no zeros. Since the current bid is only 1 zero, it's quite plausible the opponent has at least one zero in their 8 digits. Challenging now is risky. A safe and minimal higher bid is to increase the digit at the same quantity. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 1 6s is guaranteed true on my side alone, which is a safe incremental raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 and one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 1 7s, which is plausible because I have one 7 myself. Since I must bid higher, the minimal increment is to bid 1 8s, but with no 8s in my hand, that's risky. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 2 for a digit I hold. I have two 6s, so bidding 2 6s is reasonable as it leverages my strong holding and is a safe incremental bid.
