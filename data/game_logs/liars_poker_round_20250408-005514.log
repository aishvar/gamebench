Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 66510347, I see that I have two 6s, which is a good starting point. Since I have no information about the other player's hand, I'll make a conservative bid based on my own hand, choosing a digit I have at least one of. Bidding on the 6s seems like a reasonable starting point because it's a digit I have multiple of, and it's not too high or too low, giving me a bit of flexibility for future bids.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (92585104), I have no 6s. Since the current bid is 2 6s, and I have zero, the opponent must have at least 2 sixes for their bid to be valid. While it's possible, it's not guaranteed. However, since it's early in bidding and the bid is fairly conservative, challenging now is risky. Instead, I can safely raise the bid to 2 7s, which is a minimal increment, keeping pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given my hand is 66510347, I have two 6s and no 7s. The current bid is 2 7s. Since I don't have any 7s, I must rely on the likelihood of Player 1 having at least two 7s or having one 7 and hoping I have the other, which is not the case. Considering the bid history, Player 1 just bid 2 7s after I bid 2 6s, indicating they might be trying to bluff or actually have a strong hand with 7s. Given I have no 7s and the bid is relatively low, challenging seems like a reasonable strategy to test Player 1's bid without risking an overly high bid myself.
