Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, one 8, one 5, one 4, one 2, one 0, and one 6. A common opening strategy is to bid on a digit I have multiple of, which provides a safe starting point. I have two 9s, so bidding 2 9s is a reasonable opening bid that reflects my hand strength and sets a solid baseline.
