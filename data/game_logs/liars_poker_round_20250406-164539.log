Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 4, a 5, and a 7 in my hand. I should look for the most common digit and bid on it. With no bids yet, I can start with a relatively high quantity and a moderate digit. I see that 4 is the most common digit in my hand, and I have two 4s, so I should bid on 4.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 1, 5, 4, 9, 6, 0, 9, 0. There is only one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s, which means there are at least three 4s total across both hands. Since I only have one 4, the opponent would need to have at least two 4s for the bid to be valid. This is plausible, but not guaranteed. Instead of challenging now, a safer approach is to increase the bid slightly with a digit where I have strong presence. I have two 0s and two 9s, so I can confidently bid 3 9s, which is a higher bid (same quantity, higher digit).

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Player 1's bid of 3 9s seems reasonable given the current bid history. However, I have a 9 in my hand, which increases the likelihood of higher quantities of 9s. I should bid a higher quantity of 9s to stay competitive.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s. The current bid is 4 9s, so for that bid to be valid, there must be at least two more 9s in Player 0's hand. Given typical digit distribution, having four or more 9s total is plausible but somewhat unlikely. If Player 0 had only one 9, their bid would be risky. Since I hold two, it's quite possible Player 0 has at least two as well, making the total four. Because the bid is borderline plausible, I will raise cautiously to test their confidence.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 9s (digits: 15496090). The current bid is 4 9s, which means the opponent claims there are at least four 9s among both hands. Since I hold three, the opponent would need to have at least one 9 to make the bid plausible. While possible, it's risky to assume they have one or more additional 9s. Given that four is already a high count for a specific digit in 16 total digits, and I hold the majority of 9s, it's statistically unlikely there are four or more 9s in total. Therefore, I will challenge.
