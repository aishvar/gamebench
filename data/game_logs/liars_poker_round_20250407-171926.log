Player 0 Reasoning: Since it's the first turn and there's no current bid, I need to make the initial bid. I will analyze my hand to determine the most frequent digit. My hand is 01644196. The frequency of digits in my hand is: 0(1), 1(2), 4(2), 6(2), 9(1). The most frequent digits are 1, 4, and 6, all with a count of 2. I will bid on the highest of these digits to maximize the chances of the bid being valid. Therefore, I will bid on '6' with a count of 2.
