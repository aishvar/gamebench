Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I see one 0, so the current bid of 1 zero is plausible. Since I must raise, the minimal valid bid is 1 1s. Looking at my hand, I also have no 1s, but two 2s and two 3s. A safe incremental bid would be 1 3s, which is higher than 1 0s and supported by my hand. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to 2 of a digit I have multiples of, such as 2 2s or 2 3s. Since I hold two 2s and two 3s, bidding 2 2s is reasonable, indicating that at least 2 twos exist in total, which I know for sure is true. This is a safe and strategic raise.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 3s, which already fulfills the current bid of 2 3s without considering Player 0's hand. Since the bid is likely valid, challenging would be unwise. To increase the bid, I can either raise the count or bid the same quantity on a higher digit. Noticing I also have two 9s, bidding 2 9s would be a minimal valid raise, but it's safer to increase quantity to pressure the opponent. I will bid 3 3s, as I already hold two 3s, making it plausible there is at least one more 3 in Player 0's hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 3S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 4s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 3s, two 2s, two 9s, one 0, and one 8. The current bid is 3 4s, but I have zero 4s, so I cannot directly support the current bid. Statistically, for the other player to have at least three 4s is unlikely given only eight digits, especially since I have none. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
