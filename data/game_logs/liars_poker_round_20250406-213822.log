--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a reasonable bid. Bidding 3 8s is a good starting point, as it's based on my hand and leaves room for the other player to either escalate or challenge.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable increase in quantity. I do not have any 9s in my hand, so I cannot bid 3 9s. Challenging seems risky because 3 8s is a plausible bid, given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have three 8s in my hand, so the other player must have at least one 8 for the total to be four. Challenging is risky, but given the high likelihood of the total being four, I decide to challenge.
