Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I see one 0. Since the current bid is 1 0s, there is at least one 0 in my hand alone. Given the total of 16 digits, it's quite probable there is at least one more 0 in Player 0's hand. Therefore, a safe and minimal higher bid would be 2 0s, which is both plausible and raises the quantity, satisfying the bidding rules.

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 2 1s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 87560239, I have zero 1s. The current bid is 2 1s, so Player 0 is claiming there are at least two 1s across both hands. Since I have none, all 1s would have to be in Player 0's hand. That is possible but somewhat unlikely, as the probability Player 0 has two or more 1s in their 8 digits is about 23%. Given this low probability, it's a good spot to challenge rather than risk making a dubious higher bid.
