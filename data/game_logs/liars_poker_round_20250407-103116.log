Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 7, one 9, and one 3 (so two 3s). Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I can bid '2 3s' based on my two 3s, which is likely safe and sets a good baseline.
