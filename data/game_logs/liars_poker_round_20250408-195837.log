Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: There are no previous bids, so I can start with a bid that I know is safe. My hand shows two 5s, meaning I have certainty that at least two 5s are in play. By starting with '2 5s', I set a low but credible bid that forces my opponent to either raise or risk a challenge later.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. I could challenge, but there's a chance the other player has a few 5s. A safer move is to increase the bid slightly. I'll bid 3 6s, as I don't have any 6s myself, so I'm not revealing any information about my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold 2 sixes in my hand and the current bid is 3 6s – which requires only one six from the opponent’s 8 unknown digits. Statistically, the chance that the opponent has at least one six is about 57%, meaning there’s roughly a 43% chance they have none. Any bid I make instead would require even more sixes (or switch to a digit I have less of), resulting in an even lower probability of being correct. Therefore, challenging this bid gives me the best chance of winning this round.
