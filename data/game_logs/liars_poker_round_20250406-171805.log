Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s, so bidding 2 6s seems like a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I don't have any 6s in my hand. To increase the bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I will increase the quantity to 3 and keep the digit as 6.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have a 6 in my hand, and I know there are at least 3 sixes in total because the previous bid was 2 6s and the current bid is 3 6s. Given that I have a 6 and the total count could reasonably be higher than 3, I should try to increase the bid quantity or digit. Since I have one 6, bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I don't have any 6s in my hand. Since I don't have any information to suggest the bid is incorrect, and I need to make a valid bid, I'll bid slightly higher. I will bid 5 7s.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains 61410269. I have one 7 and no information about Player 1's hand. I also have two 6s, which were previously bid. The current bid of 5 7s seems potentially valid given that there are 16 digits in play and Player 1 could have a significant number of 7s. However, I don't have enough information to be certain. I can try to bid higher with a digit I have. Since I have two 6s and the last bid was 4 6s, I can try to increase the quantity or digit. Bidding 6 6s seems reasonable as it's higher than the previous 4 6s and 5 7s seems unlikely to be accurate given the total number of digits in play.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand. The previous bids have been fluctuating around 6s and 7s. Bidding 7 0s is a safe increase in quantity, and I have a 0 in my hand, though that's not the primary reason for this bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 7 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is the better option. My hand contains the digits 6, 1, 4, 1, 0, 2, 6, and 9. The maximum possible quantity for any digit across both players' hands is 16. The current bid of 7 0s seems high but I need to consider if it's likely or not. I have two 6s in my hand, and the last few bids have been quite high. I should consider if there's a possibility that the digit 0 has such a high count. Given that I do not have many 0s (none in my hand), I should consider making a bid that seems reasonable and higher than the current one.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 1S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 8 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Bidding higher seems risky. I'll challenge since 8 ones seems like a high number, given that there are only 16 total digits.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) challenges Player 0's (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bid of 8 1s.
