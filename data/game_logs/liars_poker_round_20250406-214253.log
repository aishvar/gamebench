Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. Given the current bid is 1 0s, which is the minimum possible bid, and considering I do have a 0, it's reasonable to increase the bid slightly. Since I only have one 0, bidding on a higher quantity of 0s might be risky. However, I can bid on the same quantity but a higher digit. Looking at my hand, I see I have a few digits, but none of them appear more than once except for none, which means I don't have enough information to safely bid higher quantities of any specific digit. Given this, a safe move would be to bid on the same quantity (1) but a higher digit than 0, which would be 1 1s, considering I have a 1 in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 1 2s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Looking at my hand, 04318396, I notice I have one 3. Since I only have one 3 and the bid needs to be higher than 1 2s, bidding on the quantity of a higher digit seems more feasible. However, I should also consider the likelihood of certain digits appearing. Given that I have two 6s and no other digit repeats more than once in my hand, and considering the opponent's naive 50/50 strategy might not necessarily aim for the highest possible bids, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. A safe increase would be to bid on a digit I have at least one of, ensuring I'm not overestimating. Since I have a 3 and two 6s, and the current bid is 1 2s, I could bid 1 3s as it's a higher digit and I have at least one 3, or consider the presence of my 6s for a potentially safer bet. However, given the need for a strict increase and the information from my hand, bidding 1 3s seems like a reasonable next step without overcommitting, as it increases the digit value from 2 to 3, which is a direct and minimal increase.
