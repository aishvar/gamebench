--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first move of the game, so I must open with an initial bid. Looking at my hand (70062321), I have two 0s, one 1, two 2s, one 3, one 6, and one 7. The most common digits in my hand are 0 and 2, each appearing twice. Since there are 16 digits total in play, it's statistically safe to start with a conservative bid of 3 of a digit I have at least two of, such as 2s. This balances safety and pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 twos. Looking at my hand (1, 5, 4, 9, 6, 9, 3, 3), I see zero 2s. Since I have none, all 3 twos would have to come from Player 0's hand, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. The probability that Player 0 has 3 or more 2s is low. Therefore, challenging is the best move rather than raising the bid.
