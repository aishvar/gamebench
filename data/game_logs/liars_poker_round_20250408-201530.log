Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand (digits: 5,7,4,2,1,9,2,9). Since there are 16 digits total and the current bid is only 1 0s, it's very likely Player 0 has at least one 0, making a challenge risky. The minimal legal raise is to increase the digit while keeping quantity at 1, so I'll bid 1 1s, which I know I have at least one of, making the bid safe.
