Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make an initial bid. I have two 1s in my hand. I will bid a small number of 1s to start.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand (06806739). To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. I see that I have multiple 6s and 7s, but no 8s or 9s. Bidding 3 2s or higher seems reasonable as it increases the digit. However, I should also consider the likelihood of the other player having the digit I'm bidding on. Since I have one 1, it's possible the other player has at least two 1s, making the bid plausible. I'll bid 3 2s as it's a conservative increase.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. I could bid 3 3s, which is a slightly higher bid. However, I'm not confident that there are at least three 3s in total. I could also bid 4 0s, since I have one 0. However, I'll play it safe and bid slightly higher based on what I know. I'll bid 4 2s, increasing the quantity slightly.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 2S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have one 2 in my hand (06806739), so the total count of 2s must be at least 1 (mine) + 1 (opponent's, minimum to make their bid plausible). The bid of 4 2s is already quite high. However, I can bid higher by increasing the digit. I have multiple 6s and 7s, so I can make a reasonable guess that there might be more of these digits in total. Bidding 4 3s is a safe increase in digit without committing to a higher quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I don't have any 3s in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, which is a safe increase in quantity. However, since the previous bids have been relatively low, it might be a bluff. I will bid slightly higher to test the waters.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have two 0s in my hand (06806739), so the total count of 0s must be at least 2. While it's possible that the other player has 3 or more 0s, it's not extremely likely since I have a significant portion of the total 0s. However, bidding higher on 0s is not an option. I can either bid a higher quantity with a different digit or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. I see that I have a total of 3 digits that are 6 or higher (6, 7, 9). It's plausible that together we have more than 5 of a higher digit than 0. I'll choose to bid the same quantity (5) but with a higher digit (1), since I don't have enough information to confidently bid higher than 5.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. Bidding 6 1s is a safe increase.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 1S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have one 1 in my hand (06806739). The total count of 1s across both players must be at least 6 to validate the bid. Since I have one 1, my opponent must have at least 5 1s. While possible, it's a relatively high count. However, my hand also contains other digits that could be used to make a higher bid. I can see that I have a total of 2 zeros, 1 one, 1 two, 0 threes, 1 four (not present), 1 six (and one other 6), 2 sevens, 1 three, and 1 nine. A reasonable next bid could be to increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 7 1s is a possibility if I believe my opponent has a lot of 1s, but it's a bit of a stretch given the quantity. Alternatively, bidding 6 2s is a safer option as it increases the digit. However, I should consider the likelihood of my opponent having a strong hand in 1s. Given the bid history, it's clear that both players are trying to outbid each other in various digits. Since I have some other digits, I'll choose to bid 6 2s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. Bidding 7 0s is a safe increase in quantity and doesn't rely on my hand's specific digits.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 7 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. My hand is 06806739, which contains two 0s. The total count of 0s across both players is at least 2 (mine) and potentially more if Player 0 has some. However, bidding 8 0s seems plausible because it increases the quantity. I should check if there's a more reasonable bid or if challenging is an option. Since the current bid is 7 0s, I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding 7 1s is a valid move as it keeps the same quantity but increases the digit. Given that I have two 1s in my hand (from 06806739), it's reasonable to believe there could be more 1s in total. Thus, bidding 7 1s is a strategic move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. Bidding 8 1s seems like a reasonable increase, and it's not an outrageous claim given that there are 16 total digits.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 8 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s. My hand is 06806739, which contains two 1s. The total count of 1s across both players must be at least 2 (the ones I have) plus some unknown number from Player 0's hand. Given that Player 0 has already bid 8 1s, it's possible they have some 1s, but bidding 8 2s seems like a safe increase as it raises the digit. However, I should consider if it's more likely that Player 0 is bluffing or has a strong hand. Since I have two 1s and the bid is already at 8, I should think about the maximum possible count and the likelihood of Player 0 having more than 6 additional 1s. Given the history of the game and the fact that the bid has been escalating, I should consider if challenging is a better option. However, making a higher bid seems reasonable.
