Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a total of 8 digits in my hand: 3 zeros, 2 threes, 1 four, and 1 one. Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make a valid bid. Given that I have 3 zeros, I can start with a bid of 3 zeros, which is a reasonable and safe opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s (digits are 1,9,9,2,6,2,5,7). The current bid is 3 0s, which requires at least three zeros across both hands. Since I have zero, all three would need to be in the opponent's hand of eight digits, which is unlikely but possible. Rather than challenge immediately, I can make a safe higher bid based on my hand. I have two 9s, so bidding 3 9s (same quantity, higher digit) is a reasonable incremental bid supported by my hand.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s and one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which seems unlikely given that I have no 9s. I can bid 4 3s, which is a valid higher bid since I have enough 3s to support it and it increases both the quantity and the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 9s (digits: 1 9 9 2 6 2 5 7), and the current bid is 4 3s. Since I have no 3s, I estimate the total number of 3s in both hands is unlikely to be 4 or more. Given the low probability, challenging the bid is a strategic move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
