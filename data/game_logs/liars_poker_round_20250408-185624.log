Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand and all other digits appear only once. With no current bid, a safe and logical opening move is to bid on the digit I know is most prevalent in my hand. Bidding '2 9s' ensures the bid is backed by my cards, and there's a fair chance the opponent's hand includes additional 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have a single 9. The current bid is 2 9s, which is plausible since I have one, and the opponent may have one or more. Making a minimal higher bid is safe, so I'll increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same by bidding 2 9s -> 2 9s is invalid, so instead I will increase the quantity to 3 9s. Since I only have one 9, expecting there to be three 9s total is somewhat risky but still within reason given 16 total digits; statistically, this is plausible.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand while the current bid of 3 9s requires that the opponent supplies at least one 9. Given that the probability of the opponent having a 9 in an 8‐card hand is roughly 57% (since the chance of him having no 9s is about (0.9)^8 ≈ 43%), the current bid isn’t overwhelmingly strong. If I bid higher—my only option being to raise the quantity to 4 (and my best shot is '4 9s' since I hold two 9s)—then the opponent would need at least 2 9s, which happens only about 19% of the time. In comparison, challenging now gives me a more favorable chance. Therefore, I choose to challenge.
