Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. Starting the bidding with 3 2s is a moderate move, considering the opponent might have at least one more 2.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. I can see that bidding '4 2s' would increase the quantity while staying with the same digit. Alternatively, I could bid with a higher digit but the same quantity. Since my hand contains a 6, 7, and 8, I could potentially bid on a higher digit. However, without knowing the exact distribution of digits in the other player's hand, I should start by increasing the quantity slightly as it's a safer bet.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 2s. If Player 1 has at least one 2, the bid is valid. However, if they have none, challenging would be successful. Given the uncertainty and the potential risk, challenging is a viable option.
