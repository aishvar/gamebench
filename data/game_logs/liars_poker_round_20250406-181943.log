Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. A reasonable next bid should be higher than 1 0s. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 0, increasing the digit to 1 1s is a safe and valid move.
