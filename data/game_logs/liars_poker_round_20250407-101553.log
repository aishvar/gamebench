Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the opening bid, and I have two 4s, two 9s, one 2, one 7, one 5, and one 3. A safe and reasonable opening bid is usually 2 of a digit I hold multiple of. Since I have two 4s and two 9s, I can start with '2 4s' or '2 9s'. I'll choose '2 4s' as a conservative but solid opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I see one 5. The current bid is 2 5s, so there must be at least one more 5 in Player 1's hand for their bid to be valid. This is quite plausible. To continue the game and avoid an early risky challenge, I'll make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving from 2 5s to 2 6s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 9, 2, 7, 5, 4, 9, 4, 3. I see only one 7. The current bid is 2 7s, which is plausible assuming the opponent has at least one 7. To raise, I can either bid 2 8s or increase the quantity to 3 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s and two 4s, making a bid of 3 4s or 3 9s more credible. Since I hold two 9s, a bid of 3 9s is reasonable, betting that the opponent has at least one 9. This is a safe and higher bid both in quantity and digit.
