Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a low bid. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding '2 7s' is a safe starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 80403692, I have zero 7s. Since the current bid is only 2 7s, it's plausible the opponent has 2 or more 7s, but there's still a decent chance they don't. However, it's a low bid early in the game, so challenging now is risky. A safer approach is to increase the bid slightly. I notice I have two 0s. Bidding 3 0s increases the quantity, and since 0 is less than 7, I cannot bid '2 8s' or '2 9s' to be higher; thus, I must increase quantity. Therefore, bidding 3 0s is a valid higher bid supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. I could bid 3 of a higher number, but I have two 7s. The last bid before the current one was 2 7s. I will bid 4 7s, increasing the quantity.

Player 0 bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 80403692, I have zero 7s. Since the current bid is 4 7s, my opponent is claiming at least 4 sevens across both hands. Given I have zero, this would require the opponent to have all 4 or more sevens, which is statistically very unlikely in 8 digits. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
