Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 64523182, which contains one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, and one 8. I can see that I have a relatively balanced distribution of digits. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. I have two of the most common digits (1 and 2 are not the most common in my hand, but 1 is relatively low). However, bidding on a digit I have more than one of could be risky if the other player also has it. I have one 8, one 6, and other digits appearing once. A safe starting bid could be on a digit that is somewhat likely to appear given my hand and considering the total count across both hands is 16. Bidding 2 1s seems reasonable as it's a low digit and I have one, making it plausible that together we have at least two of them.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 09468238, I have zero 1s, which makes me skeptical about the current bid of 2 1s. Since there are 16 digits total, it's possible the opponent has two 1s, but it's not very likely. Given I have none, the probability that two 1s exist is relatively low. Therefore, challenging now seems like a good strategic move rather than risking a higher bid on a digit I have no support for.
