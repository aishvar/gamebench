Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 30189809, I have: two 0s, one 1, one 3, one 8 (twice), one 9. Since this is the opening bid and I have two 0s in my hand, I can reasonably bid on 0s. A conservative opening bid of '3 0s' would be strategic - it's likely there's at least one more 0 in the opponent's hand given how common 0s are.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s. For the opponent's bid of 3 0s to be valid, they would need to have at least one 0 in their hand. Since each player has 8 digits, it's plausible they have at least one 0, making the total at least 3. Therefore, challenging now carries a high risk. Instead, I will make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit to 3 1s, which is a safe incremental bid and keeps the pressure on the opponent.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 1s

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 30189809, I have only one 1. The opponent bid '3 1s', meaning they believe there are at least 3 ones total between both hands. Since I only have one 1, this means they would need to have at least 2 ones in their hand for their bid to be valid. While possible, I can make a safer bid based on what I see in my hand. I have three 0s and two 8s. Since three 0s has already been bid, I'll bid '3 2s' which maintains the same quantity but increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid. This is safer than challenging since the opponent's bid of 3 1s is quite reasonable.

Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 71456330, I have two 3s, two 0s, and no 2s. The current bid is 3 2s, but since I have zero 2s, it relies entirely on the opponent having all three or more 2s, which is quite unlikely given only 8 digits. Therefore, challenging is a strong move here.
