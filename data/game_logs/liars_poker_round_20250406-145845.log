--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand '19120109', I notice that I have three 1s and three 0s, which are the most frequent digits. A safe and strategic opening bid would be on one of these digits. I'll start with '3 1s' to reflect my strong count and leave room for future incremental bids.

Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are three 1s in total across all hands. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
