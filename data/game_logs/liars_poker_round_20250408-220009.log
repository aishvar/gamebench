Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 2 threes in my hand, so itâ€™s likely there is at least one more among the other 8 unknown digits. Starting with 3 3s is a reasonable opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have a 3 in my hand, which means there are at least 3 threes in total if the other player has no threes. Given that I need to make a strictly higher bid, I should consider increasing either the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains a 3, I can confidently bid on a higher digit or a higher quantity of the same digit. I have a 3 and several other digits, but no extremely high counts of any single digit. A reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity slightly and choose a digit that I have in my hand. I have two 6s, which could be a good starting point.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I only have one 6 in my hand. Reaching a total of 4 would require the opponent to have at least three 6s in their eight digits, which seems unlikely. I will challenge.
