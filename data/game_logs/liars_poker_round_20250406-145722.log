--- Turn: Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 5s and one 6 in my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that other players have at least one 5.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since I have no 5s in my hand, I should consider bidding on a digit I have. I have two 6s, which could be a good starting point. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 3, 0, 0, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3. I do not have any 6s. The current bid is 4 6s, which requires at least four 6s across all 24 digits. Since I have zero 6s, that leaves four or more 6s distributed among the other 16 digits held by Players 0 and 1. Statistically, expecting four or more 6s out of 16 digits is somewhat unlikely, as the average count per digit would be around 1.6. Given that, and my own lack of 6s, I believe the current bid is risky and likely an overstatement, so challenging here is the optimal move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 1's (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bid of 4 6s.
