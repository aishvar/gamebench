Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 97824455. I count the digits: 9 (1), 7 (1), 8 (1), 2 (1), 4 (2), 5 (2). The most frequent digit in my hand is 4 and 5, both appearing twice. A reasonable starting bid could be on the digit '4' or '5' with a quantity of 3, hoping that the other player might also have at least one of these digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand, so the opponent must have at least two 4s for the bid to be valid. Given the uncertainty and the possibility of bluffing, challenging the bid is a safer move.
