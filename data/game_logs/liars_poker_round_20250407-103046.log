Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 0s, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 6, and one 7. The most frequent digit in my hand is 0, with two occurrences. Given there are 8 unknown digits in the opponent's hand, it's reasonable to expect at least one more 0, so a safe opening bid is 3 0s.
