Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the opening bid and there is no current bid, I want to start with a conservative but reasonable bid. In my hand, I have two 2s, two 6s, two 8s, one 1, and one 7. The most common digits are 2s, 6s, and 8s, each appearing twice. Assuming the opponent's hand has at least one more of these digits, a safe opening bid would be 3 of one of these common digits. I'll choose 3 6s as my opening bid since I hold two 6s myself.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7 and two 6s. The current bid is 3 7s, which would require at least two 7s in Player 1's hand if I only have one. That is somewhat unlikely but plausible. Since I have two 6s, increasing the bid to 4 6s is a safe and strategic move, as it leverages my known digits and pressures my opponent.
