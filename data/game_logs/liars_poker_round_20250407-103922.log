Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 9s, one 0, one 1, one 3, and one 8. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 7s, as I hold two 7s myself, making it likely there are at least two in total and possibly more.
