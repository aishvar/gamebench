Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I analyzed my hand (49198683) and noted that I have two 9s. This guarantees that there are at least two 9s in total. Since there is no current bid, I can safely start with a bid that I can back up with my hand. Bidding 2 9s is a solid opening move because if challenged later, I know the bid holds based on my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. I will bid 3 0s, increasing the quantity and choosing a digit I have.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, making the opponent's bid of 3 0s highly unlikely. With only 8 digits, the probability that my opponent has three or more 0s is extremely low. Instead of raising to a bid that I would risk backing with little support from my hand, it is safer to challenge the bid.
