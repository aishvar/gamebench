Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 zero. Looking at my hand (59822792), I have zero zeros. Since there are 8 digits in my hand, and 8 in Player 0's, the maximum zeros possible is 16. The bid of 1 zero is quite conservative and very likely true, as it only requires there to be at least one zero between both hands. Given I have none, but the opponent almost certainly has at least one zero in their 8 digits, challenging is risky. Therefore, I should raise the bid to a safe, minimal valid increase. The next minimal bid would be 1 of a higher digit, such as 1 one, 1 two, etc. I have two 2s in my hand, making a bid of 2 twos a safe and aggressive option. This increases the count and digit, putting pressure on the opponent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. Looking at my hand (59822792), I have zero 3s. For the total bid of 2 3s to be true, the opponent must have both 3s. Since each digit is equally likely, the probability that Player 0 has two or more 3s is relatively low (~10%). Given the naive opponent's random bidding style, it's unlikely they have both 3s, making the bid suspicious. Therefore, challenging here is strategically sound.
