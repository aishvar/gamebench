Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 4, 1, 9, 0, 8, 7, 7, 1, which includes exactly one '0'. The current bid is 1 zero, which is already satisfied solely by my hand. Since Player 0 is naive and bid the minimum, it's very likely there are no additional zeros in their hand, but not guaranteed. Raising to 2 zeros would require the opponent to have at least one zero, which is a 50/50 chance per digit, making the total probability for at least one zero in their hand relatively high (about 98%). Therefore, bidding 2 zeros is safe and puts pressure back on them. Challenging now is unwise since the current bid is clearly valid.
