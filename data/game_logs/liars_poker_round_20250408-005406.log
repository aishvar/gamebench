Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open. Looking at my hand 47860140, I have two 0s and two 4s, with one each of 1, 6, 7, and 8. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid is strategic. Given my two 0s, bidding 2 0s is a safe opening, but since the opponent is likely to have at least one 0 as well, starting with 3 0s is a solid yet not overly aggressive opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. Looking at my hand, 19823537, I notice I have one 0, but to make a bid, I need to consider what could be in the other player's hand as well. Since I have to bid higher, I could either increase the quantity or the digit. Given that I have two 3s in my hand, and considering the possibility that the other player might have some 3s as well, bidding on 3s seems like a reasonable strategy. I will bid on the same quantity but a higher digit, which is 3, because I have two of them and it's a safer bet than increasing the quantity without knowing the other player's hand.

Player 1 bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s and no 3s. The current bid is 3 3s, which I cannot confidently challenge since it's quite plausible that there is at least one 3 in the opponent's hand, adding to zero or more in mine (which is zero). To increase the bid, I can leverage my two 0s and raise the quantity to 4 0s, which is a reasonable escalation given my hand. This bid is strictly higher by quantity and based on my known digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. Given my hand 19823537, I notice I have one 0, but to determine the best move, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least four 0s in total between both players' hands. Since I only have one 0, I need to assess if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. Bidding on a digit I have more of seems safer, but since the current bid is on 0s and I only have one, I should consider the distribution of other digits. However, without specific information on the opponent's hand, challenging seems risky unless the bid is obviously too high. Given that 4 is not an excessively high number for any digit considering there are 16 digits in play, and without clear evidence that the current bid is too high, making a bid on a digit I have more of or seems plausible could be a good strategy. I have multiple instances of other digits, but since the bid needs to be strictly higher, I must either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit if the quantities are the same. Since my hand contains two 3s and the bid history shows a bid of 3 3s, which was surpassed by 4 0s, and considering I don't have enough information to safely challenge the 4 0s bid, I should look for a digit that could reasonably have a higher count or the same count but is a higher digit. Given these considerations and the need to make a strictly higher bid, bidding on a digit that I have a good number of or seems likely to exist in sufficient quantity is necessary.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (47860140), I have two 0s, zero 3s, and no strong evidence of many 3s overall. The current bid is 4 3s, which seems risky because I hold none, and statistically it's unlikely the opponent holds all four. The maximum total digits are 16, so four 3s is plausible but on the higher side, especially given my zero. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
