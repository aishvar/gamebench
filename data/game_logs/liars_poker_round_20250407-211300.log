Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand 35175680, I have the following digit counts: 0(1), 1(1), 2(0), 3(1), 4(0), 5(2), 6(1), 7(1), 8(1), 9(0). The most common digit in my hand is '5' with 2 occurrences. A safe opening bid is typically 2 of a digit I have multiple of, so I'll start with '2 fives'.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 27184916. The current bid is '2 5s' made by Player 0. I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher one. My hand contains zero 5s. For the current bid of '2 5s' to be true, Player 0 must hold at least two 5s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, challenging such a low opening bid is risky. It's generally better to increase the bid. 

Analyzing my hand, I have:
- two 1s
- one 2
- one 4
- one 6
- one 7
- one 8
- one 9

A higher bid must increase the quantity (to 3 or more) or keep the quantity at 2 but increase the digit (to 6, 7, 8, or 9).

Possible safe bids based on my hand:
- '2 6s' (I have one 6, need one more from opponent)
- '2 7s' (I have one 7, need one more from opponent)
- '2 8s' (I have one 8, need one more from opponent)
- '2 9s' (I have one 9, need one more from opponent)
- '3 1s' (I have two 1s, need one more from opponent)

Bidding '3 1s' seems strategically strong. It leverages my strongest digit count (two 1s), making the bid highly likely to be true (opponent only needs one 1 out of 8 digits). It also increases the quantity, putting more pressure on the opponent than bids like '2 6s' or '2 9s'. Therefore, I will bid '3 1s'.

Player 1 bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 ones. Looking at my hand (3 5 1 7 5 6 8 0), I have only one '1'. For Player 1's bid of 3 ones to be valid, they would need to have at least 2 ones in their hand. Since it's statistically unlikely to have 3 or more total ones across both hands (average count of any digit is about 1.6 in 16 digits), and given I only have one, the bid seems risky. Therefore, instead of increasing the bid, the best strategic move is to challenge, as it's probable that the total number of ones is less than 3.
