Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game, so I want to start with a conservative yet credible bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 4s, one 1, one 3, one 5, and one 8. Since I have two 2s and two 4s, starting with a bid of 3 2s is reasonable, as it is likely there is at least one more 2 in the opponent's hand, making the total at least three.
