Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have two 0s, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 5, and one 8 in my hand. A conservative but valid first bid would be 1 0s. This is a safe opening move to gauge the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 2, 9, 6, 6, 4, 5, 7, 7. I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. To raise the bid, I'll look for digits I have multiple of. I have two 6s and two 7s. A natural, safe higher bid would be '2 6s' or '2 7s', both of which increase the quantity from 1 to 2 and are reasonable given my hand. I'll choose '2 7s' to slightly increase the digit value as well.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s would be risky as it relies entirely on my opponent having the 7s. I have two 0s, and the previous bid was 1 0s. I can safely bid 3 0s, increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could consider bidding on a digit I have more of, such as 2 0s or 2 8s. However, 3 0s is the most conservative and logical increase given the prior bid and my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 2, 9, 6, 6, 4, 5, 7, 7. I have no 0s at all. The current bid is 3 0s, which means at least three zeroes across both hands. Since I have zero zeroes, all three would need to be in Player 0's hand of 8 digits. Having three or more zeroes in a single hand is possible but unlikely (~10% probability). Given this low likelihood, challenging is the best move.
