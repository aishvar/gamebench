Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 7s, two 1s, one 6, and one 2. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid based on my two 9s, I will bid 2 9s to set a baseline without overcommitting.
