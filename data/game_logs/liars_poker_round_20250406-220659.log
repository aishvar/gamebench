Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, making it a safe choice to bid on 6s. Starting with a lower quantity ensures the bid is likely valid, providing a solid foundation for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s. Since I only have one, it's possible the opponent has at least one more 6 to make the bid valid. However, bidding higher with a 3 6s would be risky since I don't know the opponent's hand. Instead, I can bid a higher digit that I have more of, like 3 7s, which I have two of in my hand, making it a safer bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, so all 7s must be in Player 1's hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which requires Player 1 to have at least 3. Considering the uncertainty and the high digit, challenging seems prudent as it's less likely they have exactly 3 or more 7s.
