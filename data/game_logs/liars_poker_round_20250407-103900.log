Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is 1 0s, and I know I have at least one, it's quite likely there is at least one zero in total. To avoid challenging such a safe bid and to progress the game, I should make a higher bid. I don't have multiple 0s, so increasing the quantity on 0s is risky. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, so bidding 2 6s is a safe and strictly higher bid (same quantity but higher digit).

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 0, 8, 2, 6, 4, 1, 3, and 7, which includes exactly one 2. Since the current bid is 1 2s, and I know I have one, there is a good chance there is at least one more 2 in the opponent's hand, but not guaranteed. However, since the current bid is quite low and safe, it is strategically better to increase the bid instead of challenging such a conservative bid. The minimal higher bid would be 1 3s, which is a safe incremental bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 0, 8, 2, 6, 4, 1, 3, 7, which includes exactly one 4. The current bid is 1 4s, so at least one 4 across both hands is certainly true. Since the bid must increase, and I possess one 4, it's plausible there could be another 4 in Player 0's hand, but not guaranteed. Making a minimal safe increase, I can bid 1 5s, but I have no 5s, making that risky. Alternatively, I can bid 2 0s since I have one 0, and zeros tend to be common. Given I have one 0, it's likely there is at least one more zero in Player 0's hand, making '2 0s' a reasonable and safe incremental bid.
