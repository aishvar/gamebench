Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. Starting the bid with 2 4s is valid since my count alone meets it. Choosing 4 as the digit because it's higher than other duplicates (3), and the quantity is reasonable to set a baseline without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 4s, which means the current bid of 2 4s relies entirely on the opponent holding at least two 4s. While that's possible, it's not guaranteed. Since the bid is quite low and plausible, challenging now is risky. Instead, I should raise the bid slightly, and I notice I have two 8s. So a safe, incremental bid would be 2 5s, but that's not strictly higher (digit is higher but same quantity, so valid). Alternatively, I can bid 2 8s, which is the same quantity but a higher digit than 4, making it a valid higher bid. This leverages my strong count of 8s and keeps the pressure on.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity or choose a higher digit. Bidding 3 4s (quantity 3 > 2) is valid since I have two 4s, giving a base to assume the opponent might have at least one. This reduces the risk compared to bidding a higher digit (e.g., 2 9s) where I have no support in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 4S'
Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 3, 2, 5, 8, 6, 9, 1. This includes two 8s and no 4s. The current bid is 3 4s, but since I hold no 4s, all 4s would have to be in the opponent's hand, which is unlikely. The chance that the opponent has three or more 4s out of eight digits is low. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
