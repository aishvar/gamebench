--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. The optimal opening bid typically targets a digit I have multiple times, maximizing my confidence. In my hand, the digits are 7, 3, 3, 4, 0, 9, 8, and 6. I have two 3s, which is the highest count of any digit in my hand. Statistically, across 16 digits, each digit appears around 1.6 times on average, so starting with a bid of 2 threes is safe and reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s, meaning there should be at least two '3's across both hands. Looking at my hand (69516127), I have zero '3's. The probability that the opponent's hand contains two or more '3's is relatively low given only 8 digits. Since I hold none, it's unlikely the total reaches two, so challenging is the strategic move.
