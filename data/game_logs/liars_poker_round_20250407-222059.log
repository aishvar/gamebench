Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid in the game. Looking at my hand (91440037), I have one 9, one 1, two 4s, one 0, one 0, one 3, and one 7. Since I have two 4s in my hand, that's a good starting point for my bid. I could bid '2 4s' since I know for certain there are at least that many. However, I could also consider what my opponent might have. With 8 more random digits in play, there's a decent chance there might be another 4 among them. So bidding '3 4s' would be a reasonable opening bid - not too aggressive but not too conservative either. I'll go with that.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 4s (digits: 0,3,8,8,3,7,4,8). Since the current bid is 3 4s and I already hold two, it's quite plausible there is at least one more 4 in the opponent's hand, making the current bid reasonable. Instead of challenging, I can safely increase the bid by raising the digit while keeping the quantity, moving to 3 5s, or increasing the quantity to 4 for any digit. Given my hand has three 8s, a strong position would be to bid 4 8s, raising both quantity and digit, leveraging my known strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. My hand is 91440037, which contains one 4, two 0s, one 3, and one 7, but no 8s. The current bid is '4 8s' made by my opponent. Since I have no 8s in my hand, all 4 claimed 8s would need to be in my opponent's hand. While this is possible, it seems somewhat unlikely that they would have exactly 4 of the same digit. I could bid '5 0s', but I only have two 0s, so I'd be betting on my opponent having at least three 0s, which is risky. I could also bid something like '4 9s', but I only have one 9, so I'd need my opponent to have at least three 9s. Given the current bid and my hand, challenging seems like the safer option since I don't have any 8s and it would require my opponent to have exactly 4 of them.
