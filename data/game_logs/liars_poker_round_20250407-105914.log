Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is 1 0s and I already have one, it's likely valid. To make a strictly higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and bid a higher digit. Given my hand contains two 1s and two 4s, a safe and incremental higher bid would be 1 1s, which is valid and minimal.
