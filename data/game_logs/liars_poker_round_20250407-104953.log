Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, one 1, one 7, one 6, one 9, one 5, and one 8. A conservative but reasonable opening bid would be 2 3s, as I already hold two 3s myself, making it likely that there are at least two 3s in total.
