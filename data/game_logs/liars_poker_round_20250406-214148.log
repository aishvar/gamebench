Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 27974864, which contains four 4s and two 7s and other digits. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand. I notice I have two 7s, so bidding on 7s seems reasonable. I'll start with a bid that reflects a digit I have, increasing the likelihood it's in the total count. Bidding '2 7s' is a conservative start.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s. Bidding 2 8s is a valid higher bid based on my hand and the current bid.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (from 27974864), so the total count of 8s is at least 1. The bid of 2 8s is plausible but I need to make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about other digits, I'll increase the digit. Bidding 2 9s is a valid move as it's higher than 2 8s.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Considering the bid history and the likelihood that Player 0 may be bluffing, challenging the bid seems risky but plausible. If the actual count of 9s is less than 2, I win. Given the potential for bluffing, challenging is a strategic move.
