Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0 (the digit '0' in '38046921'). Since the current bid is only 1 0s, it's likely the total number of 0s is at least 1, possibly more. To safely increase the bid, I can either bid 2 0s or 1 of a higher digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, so bidding 2 1s is a solid, statistically favorable move that increases the quantity and targets a digit I hold multiples of.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 38046921, I have the digits 3, 8, 0, 4, 6, 9, 2, 1. Counting the 2s, I only have one. The current bid is 2 2s, which is plausible since there could be one or two 2s in Player 0's hand. Challenging now is risky because 2 2s is quite reasonable. To make a safe higher bid, I look for digits I have multiple of. I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 8, one 9â€”so no duplicates. Since I must increase the bid, the minimal valid bid is 2 3s (same quantity, higher digit). This is a conservative and safe incremental bid that keeps the pressure on Player 0 without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 38046921, I have one 4, which means for the current bid of 2 4s to be valid, the opponent must have at least one 4. This is plausible, so challenging now is risky. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep it at 2 with a higher digit. I observe I have two 9s, making a bid of 2 9s a safe incremental raise that is strictly higher (same quantity, higher digit), supported by my hand strength.
