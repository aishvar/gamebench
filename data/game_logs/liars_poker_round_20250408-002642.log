--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my hand contains one 6, I should consider bidding higher than 3. I have a 7 and an 8, which are higher digits than 6. Given that I do not know Player 0's exact hand but need to make a strategic move, bidding 4 7s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, making the bid of 4 7s questionable. Challenging is a strategic move to test if the bid is valid.
