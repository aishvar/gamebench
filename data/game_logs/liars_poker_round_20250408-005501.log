Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two 5s in my hand, I can start with a conservative bid that reflects my hand strength. Bidding 2 5s is a safe starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (21964328), I have no 5s. The current bid is 2 5s, which requires at least two 5s across both hands. Since I have zero 5s, all 5s must be in Player 0's hand to make the bid valid. That is possible but somewhat unlikely, as it would mean they have exactly two or more 5s. Given this, challenging is a reasonable strategy because the probability that there are at least two 5s is not high.
