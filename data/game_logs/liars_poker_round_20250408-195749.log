Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Since this is the first bid, I can start with a reasonable quantity. Bidding 3 7s seems safe, assuming the other player might have one more 7.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, so the current bid of 3 7s depends entirely on my opponent's 8 hidden digits. Given that each digit has a 10% chance of being a 7, the probability that my opponent has at least three 7s is very lowâ€”around 4%. This bid is extremely unlikely to be true, so challenging is the best option.
