Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. Looking at my hand (86042802), I have two 0s. Bidding 2 0s is a safe and reasonable starting point, as it is based on the actual count in my hand and there is no existing bid to compare against.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. I can safely bid higher. I have two 5s, so bidding 3 5s is a reasonable option, increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 2 1s, 2 4s, 2 7s, 2 8s or 2 9s. However, bidding 3 5s seems most logical given my hand.

Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, which means there are at least two 5s in total. The current bid is 3 5s, which seems plausible given the possibility of more 5s in Player 1's hand. However, I can increase the bid by raising the quantity to 4, as I have two 5s and there could be at least two more in Player 1's hand. This is a reasonable bid based on my hand and the current game state.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s. I can confidently bid higher. Bidding 5 5s is a logical next step, as it increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same. This is a relatively safe bid given my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 5S'
Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 5 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 5 5s, which means there should be at least five 5s in total. Since I only have two 5s, the opponent must have at least three 5s. However, bidding higher on 5s is risky without more information. Instead, I can bid on a different digit. I have three 0s in my hand, and the previous bid on 0s was only 2 0s. Bidding 6 0s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and leveraging my strong hand of 0s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 0S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. The previous bids focused on 5s, and now Player 0 switched to 0s. This suggests they might have some, but 6 seems high. I have two 5s, and the previous bids went up to 5 5s, so it's possible there are more 5s in play. I will bid 7 5s, increasing the quantity. This is a reasonable bid given the recent history and my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 5S'
Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 7 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, and the current bid is 7 5s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total, it's unlikely there are 7 or more 5s. I don't have enough 5s to support this bid, and increasing the quantity further seems risky. Challenging is the safer option.
