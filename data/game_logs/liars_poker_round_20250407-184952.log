Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game. I have two 6s, two 0s, two 7s and one each of 1 and 3. A safe initial bid is to bid a quantity of 2 for the digit 7. My hand contributes two 7s, and it's plausible the opponent also has at least one. Bidding higher than 2 might be too aggressive this early, and a lower quantity is unlikely to be accepted.
