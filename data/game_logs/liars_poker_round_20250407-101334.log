Player 0 (Naive) making initial bid: 1 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Since I have two 8s and two 9s, I can confidently increase the bid by either quantity or digit. A safe incremental bid is 1 1s, but a better strategic move is to raise the quantity on a digit I hold multiples of. Therefore, I will bid 2 8s, which is a reasonable and stronger bid based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 9s (positions 2, 8, and 7). Since the current bid is 2 9s and I alone hold three 9s, the actual count is at least 3 regardless of Player 0's hand. Therefore, I can confidently increase the bid to 3 9s, which is a strictly higher bid and well supported by my hand.
