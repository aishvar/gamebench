Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I can start with any valid bid. Looking at my hand (64968281), the most frequent digit is 6 and 8, each appearing twice. Starting with a bid of 2 6s is a safe and reasonable opening move, as it's based on my actual hand and leaves room for the opponent to respond.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 6s'. I need to decide whether to challenge this or make a higher bid. My hand is 59043015, which contains two 0s, one 1, one 3, one 4, two 5s, and one 9. Crucially, I have zero 6s. For the current bid of '2 6s' to be true, the opponent must have at least two 6s in their 8-digit hand. While I have no 6s, a bid of quantity 2 is very low early in the game (16 total digits), making it quite plausible that the opponent holds two 6s. Challenging seems risky. I should consider making a higher bid. Possible higher bids include '3 0s' (or any higher quantity) or '2 7s', '2 8s', '2 9s'. Since I have two 0s and two 5s, bidding '3 0s' or '3 5s' seems like a strong strategic move. It leverages my hand's information and requires only one matching digit from the opponent's 8 cards, which is statistically likely. I will bid '3 0s'.

Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand (from my digits 64968281). The current bid is 3 0s, which means Player 1 is implying there are at least three 0s in total across both hands. Given that I only have one, it's unlikely that Player 1 has two more 0s to meet the bid. Therefore, challenging seems like the best move.
