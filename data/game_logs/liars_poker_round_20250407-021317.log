Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. As the first bidder, starting with a bid of '2 8s' is safe because even if challenged, the minimum total count is 2 (from my hand alone). This forces the opponent to either bid higher or take a risk challenging a guaranteed valid bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is only 2 8s. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand has two 8s. The opponent bid 3 8s, which requires at least one more 8 from their hand. The probability they have no 8s is significant (â‰ˆ43% if digits are uniform), making a challenge risky but plausible. However, since they raised from my 2 8s, they might have at least one 8. To avoid gambling on their bluff, a safer move is to bid 4 3s, leveraging my two 3s and hoping the opponent has two more to meet the bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 5 3s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 3S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid is 5 3s, requiring Player 1 to have at least three 3s. Given the bid history's shift from 8s to 3s and the inherent risk of holding three 3s in an 8-card hand, I suspect Player 1 might be bluffing. Challenging seems justified as the total 3s likely fall short of five.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
