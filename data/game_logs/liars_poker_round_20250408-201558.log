Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 8s, one 9, one 4, one 2, and one 7. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, as I already hold two 5s myself, making it likely the total is at least two or more.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 5, 9, 4, 5, 8, 2, 8, 7. I have zero 6s, so the total number of 6s depends entirely on Player 1's hand. The current bid is 2 6s, which is plausible if Player 1 has both 6s. Since I cannot confidently challenge this bid, the safe move is to increase the bid. I have two 5s and two 8s. Increasing the bid to 3 8s leverages the fact that I hold two 8s, so only one more 8 is needed in Player 1's hand, which is plausible. This is a reasonable and strategic next bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 59458287. Counting digits, I have one 9, two 8s, one 5, one 4, one 2, and two 7s. The current bid is 3 9s. Since I only have one 9, for the total to be at least 3 nines, the opponent must have at least two 9s, which is possible but somewhat unlikely. Given that the maximum number of 9s is 16, but typical distributions make 3 9s plausible, challenging now is risky. Instead, I can safely raise the bid. I have two 8s, and the previous bid was 3 8s before 3 9s, so the next higher bid options are 3 9s -> 4 0s (next quantity) or 3 9s -> 4 1s, ..., 4 9s. Bidding 4 8s leverages my two 8s and is a reasonable incremental raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 5, 9, 4, 5, 8, 2, 8, 7. I have one 9 and two 8s. The current bid is 4 9s, which would require at least three 9s in the opponent's hand, which is unlikely given the distribution. Since I only have one 9, it's improbable that there are four or more 9s total. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
