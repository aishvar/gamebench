Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 50915733, the digit counts are: 0(1), 1(1), 3(2), 5(1), 7(1), 9(1). The most frequent digit is '3' appearing twice. A conservative but strategic opening bid is 2 of digit 3, as it's supported by my own hand and plausible overall.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 3s'. My hand is 16470965. I have zero 3s. For the current bid to be true, the opponent must have at least two 3s in their 8-digit hand, which is possible but not certain. Challenging such a low bid early is risky. I should look for a safe higher bid based on my hand. I have two 5s and two 6s. Bidding '2 5s' is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is supported by my hand (I have exactly two 5s). This is a safe move that puts the pressure back on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains one '5' (the second digit). The current bid is 2 fives, implying at least one or two more '5's in the opponent's hand. Given that I only have one '5', it is plausible the opponent has a second '5', but not guaranteed. Since 2 fives is a conservative bid and not unlikely, challenging now would be premature. Instead, I will raise the bid. The simplest minimal raise is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, for example, bidding 2 6s. However, I have no '6's in my hand, making that risky. Alternatively, I have two '3's in my hand, so increasing the count on 3s is safer. The current bid is 2 5s, so the next valid higher bid would be 3 3s, increasing quantity. Since I have two '3's, it is plausible the opponent has at least one '3', making 3 3s a reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 16470965. I have zero 3s. The current bid is '3 3s' made by Player 0. For this bid to be true, there must be at least three 3s across both hands (16 digits total). Since I have no 3s, Player 0 must have at least three 3s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively low (around 3.8%). Player 0 previously bid '2 3s', I bid '2 5s', and they immediately raised to '3 3s'. This could indicate they have two 3s and are bluffing the third, hoping I have one or won't challenge. Given I have zero 3s, the burden of proof is entirely on Player 0's hand, making the bid statistically unlikely. Therefore, challenging is the most logical move.
