Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, two 4s, two 3s, one 7, one 1, and one 2. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 of a common digit in my hand, such as 6s, which I have two of. This sets a modest starting point without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. My hand is 19070729, which contains one 7 and no 6s. Given that I have no 6s, it's possible that the other player has two or more 6s. However, I can bid higher than 2 6s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 2 7s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, and I have one 7 in my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 43765612, I have one '7'. Since the current bid is 2 7s, it requires at least one more '7' in the opponent's hand to be valid. Given that the opponent raised from 2 6s to 2 7s, they likely have at least one '7', making the bid plausible. Raising to 3 7s would require there to be at least two more '7's in the opponent's hand, which is less probable. Alternatively, I could bid 2 8s, which is a minimal raise and keeps the pressure on without overcommitting. I will make this safe incremental raise.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. My hand is 19070729, which contains one 7 and one 8, but no 9s. The bid history indicates that the opponent bid 2 6s first, then I bid 2 7s, and they responded with 2 8s. Given that I have one 7 and one 8, and considering the digits in my hand, it's plausible that there are at least 2 eights or higher digits in total. However, I can bid a higher digit with the same quantity. I will bid 2 9s as it's a higher digit and seems reasonable given the context.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (43765612), I have two 6s, zero 9s, one 8, and one 7. The current bid is 2 9s, which is plausible but I don't have any 9s. Since the bid history shows incremental increases in digit at quantity 2, the next logical bid would be to increase the quantity to 3 with a digit I hold multiple of. I have two 6s, so bidding 3 6s is reasonable because it only requires the opponent to have at least one 6, which is likely in 8 digits. Therefore, I will bid 3 6s to increase the quantity and select a digit I have a strong count of.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. My hand is 19070729, which contains two 7s and no 6s. The bid history shows an escalation in digits. Given that I have no 6s, I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 3 6s across both hands. With 8 digits each, that's a total of 16 digits, and I have seen 2 6s in the bidding history from the opponent. It's possible they have some 6s. Bidding 3 7s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit, and I have some information about the 7s from my hand. However, I should be cautious and not overbid. Since I have two 7s, there's a total of 16 digits, and it's not an extremely high bid, I will bid 3 7s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 43765612, I have two 6s and zero 7s. The current bid is 3 7s. Since I have no 7s, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least 3 7s, which is unlikely given they hold only 8 digits. The probability of 3 or more 7s in their hand is low, especially since I have none. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
