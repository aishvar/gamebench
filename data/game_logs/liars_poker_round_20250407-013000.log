Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, one 0, one 1, one 5, one 8, one 9, and one 4. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 6s, reflecting my own hand and setting a moderate starting point.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 75729834. The current bid is 2 6s. I have zero 6s. Challenging is possible, but the bid is very low (only 2 out of 16 total digits). It's plausible Player 0 has two 6s. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 2 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is guaranteed to be true based on my hand alone. This is a safe and strategic move early in the game.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6 and one 7. The current bid is 2 7s, which is plausible since I hold one 7, so the opponent might have one or more. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable next move because I hold one 6, and the probability that there are at least two more 6s in the opponent's hand is moderate. This raises the quantity and resets to a digit I have some confidence in.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand (75729834). For the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least three 6s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively low (roughly 4-5% assuming random distribution). Although Player 0 previously bid 2 6s, increasing the quantity to 3 after my bid of 2 7s is an aggressive move. Given I hold none of the bid digit, the likelihood of the bid being false is high. Bidding higher (e.g., 3 7s, based on my two 7s) is an option, but challenging seems statistically stronger.
