Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 94630277, I have two 7s, one 9, one 4, one 6, one 3, one 0, and one 2. The most frequent digit in my hand is 7 with two occurrences. A safe opening bid is 2 of 7s, as it's supported entirely by my hand and is a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand (96588914) has no 7s, so the current bid of 2 7s is potentially high. However, the opponent could have up to 8 digits, and it's possible they have at least two 7s. Since the bid is still relatively low, it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. The next logical bid would be to increase the quantity to 3, keeping the digit the same (7s).

Player 1 bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 sevens. Looking at my hand (94630277), I have two 7s. For the bid to be valid, there must be at least 3 sevens across both players' hands. Since I hold two 7s, Player 1 needs to have at least one 7, which is quite plausible. Challenging now carries a significant risk. To continue strategically, I can raise the bid by increasing the digit or quantity. The safest next legal bid is 3 8s (higher digit, same quantity). Checking my hand, I have no 8s, so that would be risky. Alternatively, I can bid 4 of a digit I have many of. I have two 7s, one 9, one 4, one 6, one 3, one 0, and one 2. The only digit I have multiple of is 7. So the natural next bid is 4 7s, assuming the opponent might have 2 or more 7s, which is plausible. It is safer than challenging now.

Player 0 bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '7' in my hand (96588914). The current bid is '4 7s', which means Player 0 is implying there are at least 4 '7's across both hands. Given that I only have one '7', Player 0 would need to have at least 3 '7's in their hand for the bid to be valid. The probability of Player 0 having 3 '7's in an 8-digit hand is relatively low, especially since the bid has already escalated from 2 to 4 '7's. Therefore, it is reasonable to challenge the current bid.
