Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player to bid, I can choose any digit and quantity. Observing my hand (60519419), I notice the digit '1' appears twice. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I can safely bid 2 '1's, assuming the other player might have at least one '1'. This is a conservative yet valid starting bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 ones. Looking at my hand (23573707), I have zero 1s. Since I have no 1s, for the current bid to be valid, opponent must have at least 2 ones in their hand. That is statistically unlikely, as 2 or more 1s in 8 digits is not very common. Therefore, it is a good opportunity to challenge, expecting that Player 0 probably does not have 2 or more 1s, making their bid likely invalid.
