Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first move of the game, so I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand '70405257', I have: one 0, one 1, zero 2s, zero 3s, two 4s, two 5s, one 7, and zero 6s, 8s, and 9s. Since I'm starting, I should bid on a digit I have multiple of to increase my chances. I have two 4s and two 5s in my hand. The opponent has 8 unknown digits, so there could be more 4s or 5s there. A conservative opening bid would be to claim there are 3 of either 4s or 5s total. I'll go with 3 fives, which means I'm claiming there's at least one more 5 in my opponent's hand beyond the two I already have.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 fives. In my hand (11962324), there are zero 5s. Since I hold zero, for Player 0's bid to be truthful there must be at least 3 fives in their own hand, which is unlikely given typical digit distributions. The average count of any digit across 16 digits is about 1.6, so having 3 fives total is above average and unlikely without any in my own hand. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
