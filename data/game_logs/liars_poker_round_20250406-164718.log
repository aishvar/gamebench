--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder with no current bid, I want to make a safe, reasonable opening bid. My hand contains two 0s, two 2s, two 3s, one 7, and one 9. Since I have two 2s and two 3s, a conservative but credible opening bid would be 3 2s or 3 3s, expecting the opponent to have at least one more of those digits. I'll choose 3 3s as my opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. Given my hand contains a 7 and a 6, I can confidently bid 3 7s, increasing the digit based on my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 02339702, I have two 0s, two 2s, two 3s, one 7, and one 9. The current bid is 3 7s, and since I only have one 7, Player 1 would need to have at least two 7s for the bid to be valid. This is plausible but not guaranteed. However, since I have two 3s, making a bid of 4 3s is safer and strictly higher than 3 7s by increasing the quantity. This leverages my strong count of 3s and puts pressure back on Player 1.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s, and I have one 3 in my hand. I can bid 4 4s, which is higher than the current bid by increasing the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 4S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 0, 2, 3, 3, 9, 7, 0, 2. There are no 4s at all. The current bid is 4 4s, which requires at least four 4s across both hands. Since I have zero 4s, all four would have to be in my opponent's hand of 8 digits, which is unlikely. The probability that the opponent has four or more 4s is quite low, so challenging is the best move here.
