Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 53582381, I have two 5s, two 3s, two 8s, one 2, and one 1. The most common digits in my hand are 3, 5, and 8, each appearing twice. A good opening bid typically starts conservatively with a digit I have multiple times, as there's a reasonable chance the opponent has at least one as well. Therefore, a safe and strategic opening bid is '3 5s', which reflects my two 5s plus a reasonable assumption that the opponent has at least one 5.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s, meaning Player 0 is asserting there are at least three 5s across both hands. Looking at my hand (41873076), I have no 5s. This means all three 5s must come from Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. Given that Player 0's hand is only 8 digits, it seems unlikely they would have exactly 3 or more 5s without overestimating. Therefore, I believe the bid is too high and should be challenged.
