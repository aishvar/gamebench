Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) making initial bid: 1 0s

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is 1 0s, and knowing there are 8 unknown digits in Player 0's hand, it's quite likely there could be at least one more zero. Therefore, raising the bid to 2 0s is safe and a minimal increment over the current bid, keeping pressure on Player 0 without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 2 1s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 5, 0, 0, 2, 9, 7, 8, 5. I have zero 1s, so for the current bid of 2 1s to be valid, the opponent must have at least 2 of them. While possible, it's not guaranteed. However, I have two 0s myself, so bidding 3 0s is reasonable since the opponent likely has at least one 0, making 3 or more 0s quite plausible. This is a safe and incremental higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 1s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (50029785), I have zero 1s, so all three claimed 1s must be in Player 0's hand. The probability that Player 0 has exactly three 1s in their eight digits is quite low. Since the bid is 3 1s and I have none, it's unlikely there are three in total, so challenging is the best move.
