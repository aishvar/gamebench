Player 0 Reasoning: It is the first turn, and there are no bids yet. I have two 2s, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 7, one 8, and one 9 in my hand. A conservative opening bid would be 2 2s, as I know I have at least two 2s. This bid sets a reasonable starting point without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 2 4s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, making it a valid higher bid. Since I already have two 4s, this bid is supported by my hand even if the opponent has none.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. In my hand, I do not have any 4s, which makes it less likely that there are many 4s across both hands. However, challenging at this stage would be risky since 2 4s is a low bid and could easily be true. Instead, I will make a higher bid based on the digits in my hand. I have two 2s, which makes 3 2s a reasonable bid, as it increases the quantity while staying on a digit I have confidence in.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s. Bidding 3 4s is a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit). Assuming the opponent has at least one 4, the total could reach 3 or more, making this bid plausible.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 4. The current bid is 3 4s, which means there must be at least three 4s across both hands. Since I only have one 4, Player 1 must believe there are at least two more 4s in their hand. This seems plausible, so challenging would be risky. Instead, I will raise the bid. I also have two 2s, so I can reasonably bid 4 2s, increasing the quantity while switching to a digit I have more of.

Player 0 bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. My hand has only one 2. For the bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least three 2s. Given the bid history and the low likelihood of them having three 2s in their 8 digits, challenging is the best move.
