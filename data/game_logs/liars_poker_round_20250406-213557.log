Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I can choose any quantity and digit. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 3 9s is a reasonable starting point, leveraging my existing digits and setting a moderate challenge.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, there are zero 9s. Since the total number of digits is 16, and I have none, the opponent would need at least 3 9s in their hand for the bid of 3 9s to be valid. While this is possible, it is somewhat unlikely for a single player to hold 3 or more of a specific digit. However, it's not improbable enough to justify an immediate challenge. Instead, I can safely raise the bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, choosing a digit where I hold multiple copies. I have two 0s, so bidding 3 0s increases the digit to a lower value but is a valid higher bid due to the digit order. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity with a digit I have multiples of. Since I have two 0s, raising to 4 0s is a reasonable, slightly aggressive but defensible bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s, and I have only one 0 in my hand. It's unlikely that the other player has three 0s, making the total four. Challenging seems like a good move here.
