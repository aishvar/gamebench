Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible. Since I must bid higher, the minimal valid raise is either 2 0s or 1 1s. Given that 0s are relatively rare and I only have one, it's safer to increase the digit rather than the quantity. Therefore, I will bid 1 1s to minimally raise the bid without overcommitting.
