Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (67542682), I have two 6s. Bidding 2 6s is a safe starting point, as it is based on the actual count in my hand and sets a baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s and I have no 6s in my hand, so if the bid were correct, both 6s would have to come from my opponentâ€™s 8 unknown digits. The probability that an 8-digit hand contains at least two 6s is around 18.7%, which is quite low. Given these odds, challenging the bid is a strong move.
