Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the opening bid, so I want to start with a reasonable, conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 5s and two 0s, which are my most frequent digits. A safe opening bid is 2 5s, reflecting my own hand and leaving room to maneuver in future rounds.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one digit '5'. The current bid is '2 5s', meaning the opponent likely has at least one '5'. Given that there are 16 digits in total, it's reasonable to believe at least two '5s' exist. However, since I'm uncertain about more '5s', it's safer to increase the bid slightly on another digit I have multiple copies of. I have two '3s', making a bid of '2 6s' invalid (since it's lower digit than current bid), but '2 6s' is invalid anyway. Therefore, I must either bid higher quantity or same quantity with higher digit. Given my hand has two '3s' and '8s', bidding '2 8s' is valid and safer because I already have two '8s', so I don't rely on the opponent's hand.

Player 1 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 59610542, I have zero 8s. Since the current bid is only 2 8s, it's plausible the opponent has two 8s or one 8 and is bluffing. Because 2 total 8s is quite reasonable across 16 digits, challenging now carries a high risk. Instead, I will escalate the bid to 3 of a digit I hold multiple of. I have two 5s and two 0s, so bidding 3 5s is a sensible, safe increase over 2 8s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (digits: 1, 3, 9, 8, 7, 3, 8, 5), I have exactly one '5'. The current bid is 3 '5's, meaning Player 0 believes there are at least two more '5's in their hand. Given that Player 0 initially bid '2 5s', then returned to '3 5s' after my bid of '2 8s', it's likely they hold multiple '5's. Since I already have one '5' myself, the bid of '3 5s' seems plausible. However, I don't have a strong enough hand to confidently bid higher on '5's. Instead, I will bid conservatively on a digit I have multiples of. I have two '8's, and previously bid '2 8s'. To increase my bid, I can safely bid '3 8s', assuming Player 0 might have at least one '8'.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (openai/gpt-4.5-preview) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 59610542, I have zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, meaning there must be at least three 8s across both hands. Since I have none, the opponent would need all three 8s in their hand of 8 digits, which is unlikely. The average expected count of any digit across 16 digits is about 1.6, so three 8s is already on the high side. Given I have zero 8s, it's improbable there are three in total, so I will challenge.
