Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '76015526', I have zero 0s. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, and I have none, it's quite possible the opponent has one 0, making the bid plausible. A challenge would likely fail. The minimum valid raise is either increasing the quantity to 2 0s or bidding 1 1s. I see two 1s in my hand, so bidding 2 1s is a solid and safe higher bid based on my hand.
