Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I don't have any 2s in my hand. However, I also don't have enough information to confidently challenge. I can raise the bid slightly to 3 3s. This is a safe move, as it only increases the digit and keeps the quantity the same.
