--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open with an initial bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 8s, one 3, one 2, one 9, and one 6. A common and safe opening bid is 2 of a digit I have multiples of. I have two 5s and two 8s, so I can start with either. Choosing 2 5s as an opening bid is reasonable and conservative.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, so the total number of 5s depends on Player 0's hand. Since I cannot make a higher bid with my current hand, challenging the bid is the best option.
