Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s and two 8s. A bid of 2 8s seems reasonable as it reflects the number of 8s I have and doesn't overestimate the total count.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. Since the opponent has already bid 2 8s, it is possible they have some 8s. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity to 3 and choosing a digit that is not 8. I will choose 3 0s as it is a valid bid.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. I have two 6s and two 8s in my hand, and the current bid is quite low. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 8s and the current bid is 3 0s, bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to 2 8s. However, I should verify if there's a possibility of having more 0s or 8s in total, considering the opponent's hand might also have some 8s or other high digits.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I don't have any 8s in my hand. To make a valid bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. I could bid 4 9s, or 5 of any digit. Since I don't have any strong information, I'll bid 5 0s. It's a safe, small increase.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 3, 2, 8, 6, 2, 6, 4, 7. I have no 0s, so bidding higher on 0s is not possible for me. I should look for a digit that appears multiple times in my hand to make a reasonable bid. I have two 6s and two 8s, but no 0s. The last bid was 5 0s, so I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 0s, I will increase the digit. I see that I have two 6s and two 8s. Bidding 6 8s seems reasonable as it's higher than 5 0s and based on the digits I have.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. There are a total of 16 digits in play. It is plausible that there are six 8s. I don't have any 8s in my hand. I could bid higher, but I will challenge instead as it seems risky to bid much higher.
