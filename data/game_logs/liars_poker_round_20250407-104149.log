Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. I could bid 3 1s, or I could bid a slightly higher digit. Since I don't know the other player's strategy, I will bid 3 1s to play it safe.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s. I could bid 3 3s, which is a slightly higher bid and doesn't rely on me having more 2s. However, I also have two 1s. The bid history shows 3 1s already. I could bid 4 1s safely.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I don't have any 2s in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, 5 1s, 5 3s, etc. or 4 of any number higher than 2. Given that the other player is a naive 50/50 player, it might be worth challenging to see if they are bluffing. However, since the quantity is only 4, it's plausible. I'll bid 5 0s to increase the quantity and see what the other player does.
