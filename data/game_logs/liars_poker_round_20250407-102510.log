Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s and two 0s, which are my strongest counts. Opening with a conservative yet credible bid is optimal. Therefore, I will bid 2 9s, reflecting the two 9s in my hand, which is a reasonable and safe opening bid.
