--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 4s, two 7s, one 5, and one 8. A typical conservative opening bid is 2 of a common digit in my hand. I will start with '2 4s' because I have two 4s, making it plausible that there are at least two 4s in total.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 82542747, I have no 5s, so the current bid of 2 5s relies entirely on Player 1 holding at least two 5s, which is plausible but uncertain. However, I have two 4s and two 7s, making a bid of 3 4s or 3 7s more defensible than accepting the current bid of 2 5s. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I will raise the quantity to 3 and select 4s, leveraging my known two 4s and hoping there is at least one more between both hands.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 2, 5, 4, 2, 7, 4, 7. There is only one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s, which means at least three 5s across both hands. Since I only have one 5, the opponent would need to have at least two 5s for the bid to be valid. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely given the distribution. Additionally, raising to 3 6s or 3 7s is risky without stronger evidence, and raising quantity to 4 would be even riskier. Given the moderate improbability of three 5s total, I will challenge.
