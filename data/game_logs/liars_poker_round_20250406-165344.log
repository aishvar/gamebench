Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 5s. Since the current bid is 2 5s, there are already at least two 5s accounted for, making that bid plausible. It is quite likely there is at least one more 5 in the opponent's hand, so a bid of 3 5s is reasonable. To increase the bid, I can either bid 3 6s or 3 5s. Looking at my hand, I also have two 2s and two 4s, but since the current bid is about 5s, raising to 3 5s is the minimal valid next bid and quite safe given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have two 5s in my hand. I can confidently bid 4 5s, increasing the quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 5S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 5. The current bid is 4 5s, implying there should be at least four 5s among both hands. Since I only have one, the opponent would need to have at least three 5s for the bid to be valid. This is somewhat unlikely given the distribution of digits across 16 total cards. The probability of the opponent holding three or more 5s is low, so challenging is the best strategic move here.
