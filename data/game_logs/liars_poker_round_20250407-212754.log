Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, the most frequent digits are 9 and 4, each appearing twice. Starting with a conservative opening bid on a digit I have multiple of increases the chance the total count is at least that number. Therefore, I will open with a bid of 2 nines.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. To make a valid bid, I need to bid higher. I could bid 3 of any digit, or 2 of a digit higher than 9 (which doesn't exist, so I need to increase the quantity). I will bid 3 3s. I have two 3s in my hand, so 3 3s is plausible. I could also challenge, but I don't have enough information to know if 2 9s is likely or not. There are 16 total digits, and the probability of having at least two 9s seems reasonable. Therefore, I will bid 3 3s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. To make a valid bid, I need to bid higher. I can bid 3 of any digit or bid 2 of a higher digit than 9, which is impossible. Therefore, I will bid 3 0s. It's a slightly risky bid, but it's better than challenging without good reason. I have one 0 in my hand, so I need at least two more 0s between the other player's hand to make this bid valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (73504949), I have one '0'. The current bid is 3 zeros across both hands. Since I can see only one zero, the opponent must have at least two zeros for their bid to be true. Given that two zeros in their hand is plausible but not guaranteed, I need to assess the likelihood. Statistically, the chance of them having two or more zeros in eight digits is moderate (~35%). Since it's not extremely unlikely, a challenge is risky. To stay in the game strategically, I will raise the bid modestly. My hand has three '9's, so a bid of 4 9s is valid and beats the current bid (since 4 > 3). This also pressures the opponent and leverages my strong count of 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. It's plausible that there are at least four 9s in total across both hands. I could bid higher, but challenging has a decent chance of success. I will challenge to try and win now.
