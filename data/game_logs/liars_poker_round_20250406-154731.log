Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s and two 5s, which are the most frequent digits. Opening with a conservative but credible bid based on my hand, I will bid 2 7s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s and one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable move because it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid. Additionally, bidding 3 9s is also a valid option, but 3 6s seems more strategic as it is less likely to be challenged given the current bid.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, so all three would need to be in Player 1's hand, which is unlikely. Statistically, expecting 3 of the same digit in 8 digits is possible but not very probable. Since I have no 6s to support the bid, challenging here is the best move.
