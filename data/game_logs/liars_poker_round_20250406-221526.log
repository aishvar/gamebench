Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so any bid is valid. My hand includes two 7s. Bidding 2 7s is safe and utilizes a higher digit (7) to set a reasonable starting point. This bid is plausible since the opponent might have additional 7s, and challenging would reveal the actual count which includes my two 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid since 7 is higher than 6. I have two 7s, so if the opponent has at least one 7, the bid holds. This avoids challenging the risk of their having 3+ 6s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 6s in my hand, and I know there is at least one 6 in the opponent's hand. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move because it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid. Challenging seems risky since the opponent could have one or more 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand has no 6s, so the opponent must have all 4. The probability of them having 4 or more 6s in their 8 digits is extremely low (approx 0.5%). Challenging is highly likely to win.
