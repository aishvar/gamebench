Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two 5s in my hand, I can start with a conservative bid that is likely to be true based on my hand. Bidding 'Q: 5 D' (quantity 2 of digit 5) is a safe starting point, as it's based on the actual count in my hand and leaves room for the opponent to respond.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 fives. Looking at my hand (8 7 1 8 8 0 9 2), I have zero 5s. Since I hold none, for the bid to be valid, my opponent must have both fives in their hand. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely given only 8 digits. Without any fives on my side, I suspect the opponent may be bluffing or overestimating. Therefore, challenging is a reasonable choice here rather than raising the bid.
