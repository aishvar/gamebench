Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (63140550), I count the occurrences of each digit: 6(1), 3(1), 1(1), 4(1), 0(2), 5(2). A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I have. I have two 0s and two 5s, which are the highest counts. Bidding on a digit I have more of seems logical. I'll bid on 5s with a quantity of 2, as it's a conservative start.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. I could bid 3 0s, which is a valid bid and doesn't rely on me having many 5s. Alternatively, I could bid 3 5s, but that might be risky. Since I don't have a strong read on the game, I'll play it safe and bid 3 0s.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have many 0s, increasing the quantity might be challenging. However, I can bid 3 1s, which is a higher digit. Alternatively, I can bid 4 0s if I believe there's at least one more 0 in the other player's hand. Given the information, bidding 3 1s seems like a reasonable and safe move.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. I could bid 3 2s, increasing the digit. Or I could bid 4 0s, increasing the quantity. I'll bid 4 0s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have two 0s in my hand, so I know there are at least 2 0s. Player 1 has bid 4 0s, suggesting they likely have at least two 0s as well. Given that there are 8 digits per player and 2 players, there are a total of 16 digits. The probability of having more than 4 0s is plausible, especially if Player 1 has more than two 0s. However, I should consider bidding higher than 4 0s. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 1, and there's already been a bid of 3 1s, I should consider bidding higher than 4 0s. Bidding 4 1s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit. Alternatively, I could bid 5 0s, increasing the quantity. Given my hand and the information available, bidding 5 0s seems like a reasonable risk, as it directly challenges the current bid by increasing the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. The previous bids have been relatively low. I could bid higher on 0s, but it's risky. I could also bid on a digit I have in my hand. I have two 1s, two 2s, one 4, one 5, and one 9. Bidding 6 0s is possible, but I'll bid 6 1s instead, since I have two 1s and it's more likely to be a valid bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 1S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have one 1 in my hand, so the total count of 1s is at least 1. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have information about other digits in my opponent's hand, I'll analyze my hand. I have 63140550, which contains one 1 and one 5 and one 0. The bid of 6 1s is quite high, so I should think carefully. I can bid 6 2s or higher, or 7 0s or higher. Given that I have one 0, bidding 7 0s seems plausible as it increases the quantity and relates to a digit I know exists in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 7 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. I have zero 0s in my hand. Bidding higher on 0s seems risky. I could bid 7 1s, matching the quantity but increasing the digit. However, I have two 1s, so bidding higher than 7 1s is also possible. I will bid 8 1s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 1S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 8 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. My hand is 63140550, which contains one 1. The total count of 1s across both players is at least 2 (one from my hand and potentially one from the other player's hand). Bidding 8 2s is a reasonable next step as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit. However, considering the quantity, I can also think about increasing it. If I assume the other player has at least one 2, the total count could be higher. Thus, bidding 9 1s is also a possibility. Given the information, bidding 8 2s seems like a safe and reasonable move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 2s. I have two 2s in my hand. Bidding higher than 8 2s seems risky. I could bid 9 0s, but that doesn't leverage my hand. Given the bid history, it's not unreasonable to think there might be eight 2s in total. However, I'm not confident enough to bid higher. Therefore, I will challenge.
