Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand '51882319', I have two 8s, two 1s, two 9s, one 5, and one 3. The most common digits are 8, 1, and 9, each appearing twice. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid would be 3 of one of these digits, reflecting my own hand's strength while accounting for the opponent potentially having at least one more. I will choose 3 8s since I have two 8s myself.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (from 72604365), so the total count of 8s is at least 1. I need to either make a higher bid or challenge. Since I have multiple high digits (6 and 5), I can consider bidding on a higher digit. Bidding 3 9s is not possible because it doesn't exist, and I don't have enough information to bid higher confidently on 8s. However, I can bid 4 5s, increasing the quantity. Alternatively, challenging seems risky as Player 0 might have two or more 8s. I'll increase the quantity and bid on a digit I have more confidence in.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 51882319, I have one 5. The current bid is 4 5s, which requires at least 3 more 5s in the opponent's hand. This is plausible but somewhat unlikely given the distribution, though not impossible. Since I have two 8s, increasing the bid to 4 8s is a safer strategic move, matching the quantity but raising the digit, and is likely to be more credible given my hand.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand contains one 8, so I know that there is at least one 8 in my hand. The total number of 8s across both hands must be at least 1 (mine) and at most 9 (if the other player has 8 more). The current bid of 4 8s is within this range and doesn't seem extremely high or low based on my hand alone. However, I can bid higher by increasing the digit. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid. I'll choose to bid 4 9s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 5, 1, 8, 8, 2, 3, 1, 9. This includes one 9. The current bid is 4 9s, meaning there must be at least three 9s in the opponent's hand for the bid to hold. Given that the average count per digit is about 1.6 (16 digits / 10 digits), having four 9s total is already quite unlikely. The probability that the opponent holds three or more 9s is low, making the current bid suspicious. Therefore, challenging is the best strategic move.
