Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains no 0s, so I have 0 of them. Given the total of 16 digits and the naive opponent's initial low bid of 1 0s, it's quite plausible that there is at least one 0 in their hand. Challenging now would be risky because even if I have zero 0s, the opponent only needs a single 0 to win the challenge. Therefore, the optimal move is to make a minimal safe higher bid. I have two 4s, so increasing the bid to 2 4s leverages my hand and is a natural progression.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 4 and one 5. The current bid is 2 5s, and since I have one 5, it's plausible there is at least one more 5 in Player 0's hand, making the bid reasonable. To raise, I can either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. I have two 4s, so bidding 3 4s is a solid move, as it increases the quantity and is supported by my hand. The probability of there being at least one more 4 in Player 0's hand is reasonable.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 5s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (44395871), I have one 5. Given the current bid of 3 5s, Player 0 likely has at least two 5s if their bid is honest. Since the maximum total is 16 digits, it's plausible there are three 5s, but not certain. Raising the bid slightly is safer than challenging now, as the bid is reasonable. I will increase the digit to 6s at the same quantity, leveraging the fact that I have one 6, making '3 6s' a plausible next bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
