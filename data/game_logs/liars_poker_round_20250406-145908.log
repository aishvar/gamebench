--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 2s, two 5s, one 4, and one 7. A safe and strategic opening bid is usually around 3 of a common digit. Given I have two 2s and two 5s, I will open with '3 2s', which is reasonable and leaves room for maneuvering in future rounds.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my hand is 95624896, I have a total of 3 '2's, 1 '5', 1 '6', 1 '8', 1 '9'. I also notice that I have 3 '2's in my hand but I don't have enough information about other players' hands. However, I can see that bidding a higher quantity or digit is possible. I have 3 '2's and other digits appear once or twice but not 3 of them. A reasonable next bid seems to be increasing the quantity or digit. I have 3 '2's which matches the current bid quantity but I don't have enough higher digits to make a strong case for a much higher bid without risking a challenge. However, I can try to increase the digit and see if it works.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 3s. Since I have two 8s, it's reasonable to assume there might be more 8s in the other players' hands. Bidding 5 8s increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a strong bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (52171425), I have zero 8s. Since there are 24 digits total and I hold 8 of them, the remaining 16 digits are unknown. For there to be at least 5 eights, the other two players would need to collectively have all 5 (or more). The probability of 5 or more 8s appearing in 16 digits is quite low, especially since I have none. Given the unlikely nature of this bid, it's a good opportunity to challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 2's (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bid of 5 8s.
Revealed Hands: P0(openrouter/quasar-alpha):52171425 | P1(meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor):95624896 | P2(mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor):97880454
Actual count of 8s across all hands: 3
Challenge Successful! Actual count (3) < Bid quantity (5).
Winner: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha)
Losers: Players 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor)
