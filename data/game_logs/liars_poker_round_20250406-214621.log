Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. I have one 7, one 0, one 1, one 4, one 5, one 9, and one 8 in my hand. A conservative bid would be 1 of any of those digits. I'll start with 1 9s as it's a higher digit and relatively safe.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 1 9s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Looking at my hand, 94835297, I see that I have one 9. Since the bid needs to be higher, I could either increase the quantity of 9s or move to a higher digit. However, increasing the quantity of 9s might not be the best strategy without knowing the other player's hand. A safer bet might be to look for a digit that appears more frequently in my hand and bid on that, ensuring the quantity is at least 2 since bidding on a single digit is already taken. My hand contains two 3s and other digits that appear once. Bidding on a digit I have more of could increase my chances of winning if the other player doesn't have many of those digits. Therefore, bidding 2 3s seems like a reasonable move, as it's higher than the current bid and based on the digits I have in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit to 4s seems reasonable, as I have no 4s, and it's a relatively low risk. Bidding 3 4s is a plausible move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 4s and examining my hand (94835297), I notice I have one 4. Since the bid is about the total count across both players' hands, and considering the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, bidding higher requires careful consideration. The current bid seems somewhat conservative, but without knowing the other player's hand, it's hard to gauge its accuracy. However, I also have a couple of 5s and other digits, which might give me an edge in bidding on a different digit or increasing the quantity slightly. Given that I only have one 4 and no 4s higher than the current bid would be a significant jump, I'll consider bidding on a different digit that I have more of, like the 5s or 9s, but increasing the quantity might be risky without more information. Since I have two 9s and one 5, and given that the current bid is on 4s, I could attempt to increase the digit or the quantity based on my hand's composition. However, considering the risk and the fact that I don't have enough information to safely increase the quantity of 4s or confidently bid on another digit without potentially overbidding, I should consider challenging the current bid if it seems unlikely or make a cautious bid. Given my hand and the need to make a strictly higher bid, I will choose to bid on a digit I have, aiming to balance the risk of overbidding with the potential reward of winning the round.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Bidding 4 5s would be a reasonable increase in quantity, and I know there's at least one 5 in play. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 1 7s or 1 8s. However, given the previous bids, it seems like the other player is trying to push the quantity. Therefore, increasing the quantity of 5s seems like the most logical move, as it's a slight increase that isn't overly aggressive.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 5s' and examining my hand '94835297', I notice I have one 5. Since the bid is about the total count across both players' hands, and considering the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, bidding higher requires careful consideration. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Given that I only have one 5 and no information about the other player's hand, challenging the current bid seems risky without more insight. However, I can attempt to bid on a higher digit or slightly increase the quantity if I feel it's plausible based on my hand and the bidding history. The history shows a progression from '1 9s' to '4 5s', indicating players are somewhat conservative with their bids. Since I don't have enough information to safely challenge or significantly raise the quantity of 5s, and given that my hand doesn't offer a clear advantage for higher digits, I must decide based on the likelihood of the next digit appearing more frequently than 5. Considering my hand and the nature of Liar's Poker, a reasonable next step could be to bid on a digit that appears plausible based on my hand and the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. The previous bids show a pattern of increasing quantities and digits. I can either challenge or bid higher. Given I have a '7' in my hand, bidding 4 7s is a reasonable next step, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This is preferable to challenging immediately, as it allows me to gather more information about the opponent's hand and potentially bluff further.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 7s, I must decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, 94835297, I notice I have one 7 and one 9, but no 8s. Since the bid is about 7s and I only have one, I must consider the likelihood of the other player having at least three 7s to meet or exceed the bid of 4 7s. Considering the bidding history, the bids have been steadily increasing in either quantity or digit value, suggesting a cautious and strategic approach from both players. However, without more 7s in my hand and given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, bidding higher than 4 7s seems risky. Challenging seems like a viable option because if the total number of 7s is less than 4, I win. Given the information and the strategic play so far, challenging the current bid of 4 7s appears to be the most prudent move, as it forces a reveal and could give me an advantage if the bid is unlikely.
