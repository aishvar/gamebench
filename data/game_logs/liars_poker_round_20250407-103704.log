Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I am required to start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s and two 7s. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be 2 9s, reflecting my own hand strength and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 70998957, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 3 0s relies entirely on Player 1 having at least 3 zeros, which is unlikely given only 8 digits. Since I have no zeros, and the total is 16 digits, the probability of 3 zeros is low. Challenging now is a strong move as the bid seems too optimistic.
