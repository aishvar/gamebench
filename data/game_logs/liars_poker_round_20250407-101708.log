Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Since I must make a higher bid or challenge, and challenging a minimal opening bid is unwise given the high likelihood the opponent has at least one 0, I will safely raise the bid to 2 of a digit I have multiple of. I have three 6s, so bidding 2 6s is a safe, conservative increase.
