--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand 56707801, I have two 0s, two 7s, two 1s, one 5, one 6, and one 8. Statistically, the most common digits in my hand are 0, 1, and 7, each appearing twice. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on this, I'll start with 3 7s, expecting that with 24 total digits, there are likely at least three 7s among all players.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have a 7 in my hand. Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity of the current digit. This bid is likely to be safe, as there are three other players who might also have 7s in their hands.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 4 sevens in total across all players' hands. Given that I have no 7s in my hand (35399020), I should consider the possibility of other players having sevens. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I must evaluate the risk of challenging versus making a new bid. My hand does not contain any 7s, which makes it risky to challenge directly without assessing the potential count of 7s across all players. However, I can try to make a higher bid with a different digit. I have two 6s and two 9s in my hand, making 6 a potential candidate for a bid increase.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6. The current bid is 5 6s, which means there must be at least five 6s across all 24 digits. Assuming an average distribution, about 2-3 of each digit typically appear across all hands. Since I only have one 6, and the bid is already at five, it seems unlikely that there are at least five 6s total. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 2's (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bid of 5 6s.
Revealed Hands: P0(openrouter/quasar-alpha):56707801 | P1(mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor):89254317 | P2(meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor):35399020
Actual count of 6s across all hands: 1
Challenge Successful! Actual count (1) < Bid quantity (5).
Winner: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha)
Losers: Players 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor)
