Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, the counts are: one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, two 5s, one 6, and one 8. A safe opening bid would be 2 5s, as I have two 5s myself, making it quite likely there are at least two 5s in total.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 5s'. I hold one 5 in my hand (51183203). This means the bid is true if the opponent (Player 0) has at least one 5. With 8 unknown digits in their hand, this is highly probable. Challenging this low bid is strategically poor. I need to make a higher bid. Options are increasing the quantity (3 or more of any digit) or keeping the quantity at 2 but increasing the digit (2 6s, 2 7s, 2 8s, or 2 9s). My hand contains two 1s and two 3s. Bidding '3 1s' is a safe and informative bid. It increases the quantity, is supported by my hand (I have two 1s), and requires the opponent to have only one 1 for the bid to be potentially true, which is statistically likely. This is a stronger move than bidding on digits I have fewer of or making a riskier jump.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 1s, making it less likely that there are 3 or more 1s across both hands. Since I hold 2 8s, a safe and strategic higher bid would be 3 8s, matching the quantity but increasing the digit, which is a valid and credible raise based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (51183203). For the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least two 8s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having two or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively low (approximately 19% based on binomial probability: 1 - P(0) - P(1) = 1 - (0.9^8) - (8 * 0.1 * 0.9^7) â‰ˆ 0.187). Therefore, it is statistically more likely that the total number of 8s is less than 3. While Player 0's jump from '2 5s' to '3 8s' could indicate strength, it's also a plausible bluff. Making a higher bid, such as '4 1s' or '4 3s' (based on my two 1s and two 3s), would require the opponent to have at least two of that digit, which carries a similar low probability of being true (around 19%). Challenging the current bid seems like the safest move based on the probabilities.
