Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 58499812, I notice I have two 9s, which is the highest count of any digit in my hand. Starting with a conservative yet reasonable opening bid based on my hand, I will bid 2 9s, indicating I believe there are at least two 9s among all 16 digits, which is guaranteed from my hand alone.
