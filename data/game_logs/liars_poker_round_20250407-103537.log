--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must open the bidding. In my hand, I have two 3s and two 0s, which are the most frequent digits. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 3s, reflecting my hand strength and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 3s, one 4, and two 0s. The current bid is 2 4s. Since I only have one 4, the likelihood that there are at least two 4s total is plausible, so a challenge now would be risky. To increase the bid, the minimal increment would be either 2 5s or 3 3s. I hold two 3s, so bidding 3 3s is relatively safe because it only requires one more 3 in the opponent's hand, which is quite likely. Therefore, raising to 3 3s is a reasonable strategic move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s and two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s, and since I hold two of those, it's quite plausible there is at least one more 4 in Player 1's hand, making the bid reasonable. To maintain pressure and build on my strong hand, a safe higher bid would be 3 5s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Calculating action for Player 1 (Naive 50/50)
Player 1 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 6s
Player 1 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 3, 4, 0, 3, 9, 2, 3. I have zero 6s, so all three 6s in the current bid must come from Player 1's hand, which is unlikely. Since there are only 16 digits total, and I hold none of the claimed digit, the probability that the other player has 3 or more 6s is quite low. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 1's (Naive 50/50) bid of 3 6s.
