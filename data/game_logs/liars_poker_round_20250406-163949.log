Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. I'll start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 3s, so bidding 2 3s seems reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. My hand has zero 3s, so challenging risks losing if the opponent has two. Bidding 2 8s is a valid higher bid (higher digit) and truthful since I have two 8s, ensuring the total is at least 2. This avoids immediate risk and shifts pressure to the opponent.

Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 3, 7, 0, 2, 6, 9, 1, 5. I have two 6s and other digits that could potentially be high. However, I don't have any 8s or higher quantity of 8s to make a strong case for a higher bid of 8s. I can bid 3 0s as I have one 0, increasing the quantity while choosing a digit that I know exists in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. My hand has no 0s, so the opponent must have at least 3 0s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of having 3 or more 0s in 8 random digits is low (around 2%). Challenging is likely profitable since it's improbable the opponent has that many 0s.
