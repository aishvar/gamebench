Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand, making it relatively safe to start with a conservative bid of 2 4s. This is a cautious opening bid, given I already hold two of them.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have one 4 in my hand (26294738). This means the bid is true if the opponent has at least one 4 among their 8 digits, which is quite likely. Challenging seems risky. I need to make a higher bid. Options are increasing the quantity (e.g., 3 0s) or keeping the quantity at 2 but increasing the digit (e.g., 2 5s). I have two 2s in my hand. Bidding '3 2s' leverages my hand's strength. This bid requires the opponent to have at least one 2. Given there are 16 total digits and I hold two 2s, it's statistically plausible (more likely than not) that the opponent has at least one 2 among their 8 digits. This bid increases the quantity, putting more pressure on the opponent than simply increasing the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 91036544, containing no digit '2'. The opponent bid '3 2s', meaning they likely have some '2's, but since I have none, it's uncertain if there are actually three or more '2's total. However, my hand has two '4's, and I previously bid '2 4s'. Given my own hand already has two '4's, bidding '3 4s' is a safer and valid higher bid, as it increases the digit from '2' to '4' while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have one 4 in my hand (26294738). For the bid to be true, the opponent needs at least two 4s in their 8-digit hand, which is plausible. Challenging seems risky, especially since the opponent raised their own bid on 4s (from 2 4s to 3 4s) after I bid 3 2s. I have two 2s in my hand. My previous bid was 3 2s. A bid of 4 2s is higher than 3 4s (higher quantity). This bid requires only two 2s from the opponent's hand to be true, which is statistically reasonable (2 out of 8 digits). It leverages my strongest digit count and seems safer than challenging or bidding on a digit where I hold fewer copies.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. My hand (91036544) contains no 2s, meaning all four 2s would have to be in my opponent's hand. While possible, it's statistically unlikely for one player to have four of the same digit. Given the risk involved in raising this bid further without any supporting digits, the safer and more strategic decision is to challenge the current bid.
