Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 9s, one 7, one 0, one 6, and one 1. A safe and reasonable opening bid is '2 8s' because I hold two 8s myself, making it quite likely there are at least two 8s in total. This sets a solid foundation for the game.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 9s (digits: 7, 0, 6, 9, 9, 8, 1, 8). Since the current bid is 2 9s and I already hold 3 myself, it's certain there are at least 3 9s total. Therefore, I can safely increase the quantity to 3 9s without risk. This is a minimal but valid raise, keeping the pressure on my opponent.
