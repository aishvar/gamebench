Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s, one 9, two 4s, one 8, one 3, and one 1 in my hand. Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on the digits I have. Bidding 2 1s is a safe starting point as I already have two 1s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. The current bid is 2 1s. Bidding 3 7s is a higher quantity and a higher digit, which is a valid and strategic move given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. Since I only have one, it's possible the opponent has two more 7s, making the bid valid. However, bidding higher with a digit I have more of, like 4 1s (I have two 1s), seems safer and increases the quantity.

Player 0 bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand, making it possible to bid 4 7s. This is a higher bid than 4 1s because 7 is a higher digit. It's a strategic move to increase the bid based on my known cards.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 1 bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. Given that there are 16 digits in total (8 per player), it's unlikely that there are 4 7s unless the opponent has 3 7s. Since I only have one, I should challenge the bid.
