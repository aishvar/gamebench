Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, and since no bid has been made yet, I can set a safe opening bid. Bidding '2 9s' leverages the fact that I already hold both 9s, and even if my opponent holds no additional 9s, the total count would exactly meet my bid. Additionally, using the highest digit I have maximizes the pressure on my opponent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (00819234), I have one 9. The current bid is '2 9s', which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 2 nines total between our hands. Since I have 1 nine, this bid would be valid if Player 0 has at least 1 nine as well. This is quite reasonable for an opening bid. I should make a higher bid. I could bid on digits I have multiples of (I have two 0s), or I could bid on other digits. Since '2 9s' is already a high digit, I'll increase the quantity instead. I'll bid '3 0s' since I already have two 0s in my hand, so I only need Player 0 to have one more 0 for this to be valid, which is fairly likely.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I don't have any 0s in my hand and out of the 8 unknown digits (the opponent's hand), the probability of having 3 or more 0s is extremely low (around 4%). Since the current bid of 3 0s is very unlikely to be accurate, I should challenge the bid.
