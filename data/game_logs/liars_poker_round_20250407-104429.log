Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I don't have any 1s in my hand. Since the previous player is a naive 50/50 player, I'll assume they're not bluffing too wildly. I'll bid slightly higher, going to 3 2s. This increases the quantity and changes the digit, making it a valid bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. I could raise the quantity to 4 3s, or keep the quantity and raise the digit. Given my hand, raising the quantity to 4 3s seems safer and more likely to be true. Alternatively, I could bid 3 of a higher digit I have, like 5, 6, or 9. Since I have one 9, bidding 3 9s might be a good option. However, since I already have a 3, raising the quantity of 3s seems a bit safer. I will bid 4 3s.
