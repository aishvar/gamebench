Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. I have two 8s in my hand. A conservative bid of 1 8s seems reasonable to start, as it's based on my known cards and doesn't require assuming much from the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '1 8s', I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have one 8 in my hand and considering the opponent could have at most one 8 for the bid to be reasonable, bidding a higher quantity of the same digit or the same quantity of a higher digit seems like a viable strategy. However, without knowing the opponent's hand, it's a bit risky to bid too high. I notice I have two 9s in my hand, which gives me a good basis to bid on 9s. Bidding on a higher digit seems safer than increasing the quantity of 8s, as the opponent might not have any 8s, making '1 8s' a bluff. Thus, bidding '1 9s' is a reasonable move, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same as the current bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 1 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit to 0 is not a good strategy as it's a low digit. Increasing the quantity to 2 9s is reasonable, given I have one 9 and there are 16 total digits. It's a small increase, but it's a valid bid.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 2 9s and my hand of 15019387, which does not contain any 9s, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least two 9s in total between both players' hands. Since I have no 9s, the bid's validity hinges on Player 0's hand. Considering the bidding history, Player 0 has already bid 1 8s and then increased to 2 9s, which might indicate confidence in their hand. However, without any 9s in my hand and given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, bidding higher than 2 9s requires careful consideration. A safe strategy would be to challenge the current bid, as it's the immediately preceding bid and allows me to test Player 0's confidence without overcommitting. Challenging also gives me the opportunity to win if the total count of 9s is less than 2, which is possible given I have no 9s and the distribution of digits can be unpredictable.
