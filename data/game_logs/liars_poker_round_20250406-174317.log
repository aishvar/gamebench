Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. I can safely increase the bid to 2 0s, as it's still early in the game and a small increase is unlikely to be challenged immediately. Alternatively, I could bid 2 of any other digit. I will bid 2 1s, as I have two 1s in my hand.
