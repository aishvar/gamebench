Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s and two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s, which means there must be at least three 4s in total. Given that I have no 4s, I can safely assume that the claim is weak. I will challenge the bid instead of making a higher one, as the total count of 4s across both hands is likely to be less than three.
