Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (23727306), I see that I have two 2s, two 3s, two 7s, and one 6, and one 0. The most frequent digit in my hand is 2, 3, and 7, each appearing twice. A reasonable starting bid could be based on the most frequent digit I have. Since I have two of several digits, a bid of '3 2s' seems like a good starting point as it slightly increases the quantity beyond what I can see in my hand, making it a relatively safe initial bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I don't have any 2s in my hand. I can raise the bid to 4 3s. This is a safe raise, increasing both quantity and digit.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have a lot of high digits, I'll increase the digit. I can bid 4 4s, which is a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, which is a safe increase. However, I also have a 1, a 5, a 6, an 8, and a 9. Bidding 5 0s is a weak move. I'll bid 5 5s instead, as I have one 5 in my hand. This is a slightly riskier bid, but potentially more rewarding.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have the digits 23727306, which contains two 2s, two 3s, and no 5s or higher digits relevant to the bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 5s or higher, and increasing the digit seems more feasible, I will bid the same quantity (5) but on a higher digit (6). Thus, bidding 5 6s is a valid and reasonable move as it adheres to the rules and is based on my hand's information.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 6 6s is a safe increase, as it only increases the quantity by one. It's possible there are at least five 6s in total, but it's also possible there aren't, so challenging is risky. I'll play it safe and increase the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have the hand 23727306, which contains two 6s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s, it's possible that the total count of 6s is at least 6 (2 from me and potentially 4 from the other player). However, bidding more than 7 6s seems risky. I can bid 6 7s, which is a valid higher bid because it has the same quantity but a higher digit.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. The bid is already quite high. Bidding higher would be risky. Challenging seems like the best option.
