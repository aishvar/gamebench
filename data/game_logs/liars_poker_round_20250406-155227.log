Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first move, so I need to open with a reasonable bid. In my hand, I have two 8s, two 9s, two 6s, one 2, and one 1. A safe opening bid would reflect a digit I have multiple of, making it likely the total count is at least three across both hands. I'll start with '3 6s' as I hold two 6s, making it probable there are at least three 6s in total.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable increase, as it's a higher quantity than the current bid. I don't want to challenge immediately, as it's plausible someone could have enough 6s to reach 3, and I have one myself. A higher bid keeps the game going and allows me to gather more information.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 6s (digits: 8, 2, 9, 8, 1, 6, 6, 9). The current bid is 4 6s, so my opponent claims there are at least four 6s in total. Since I already have three, it's plausible they have at least one 6, making four or more 6s likely. Challenging now would be risky. To continue, I can make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, such as 4 7s, but since I have no 7s, it's safer to increase the quantity of 6s to 5, supported partially by my strong hand. Therefore, I will bid 5 6s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding higher than 5 6s is necessary. I could bid 6 6s, but that's risky given I only have one. I could also increase the digit. Bidding 5 7s seems reasonable as it's a valid higher bid and doesn't rely on me having many 7s. Alternatively, I could challenge, but 5 6s isn't outrageously high, so challenging is less appealing.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 2, 9, 8, 1, 6, 6, 9. I have no 7s, so the current bid of 5 7s relies entirely on my opponent holding at least 5 sevens, which is highly improbable given they only have 8 digits. Even if they had 3 or 4 sevens, it would still fall short. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
