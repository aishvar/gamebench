Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid. My hand contains the digits 2, 5, 8, 9, 9, 3, 0, and 8. I see that I have two 8s and two 9s. The highest possible digit I can bid on is 9. I will start with a conservative bid to test the waters.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. In my hand, I have one 8. Given that there are 16 digits total across both players, it is reasonable to assume that there could be at least three 8s in total. I will increase the quantity to 3 while keeping the digit as 8, as this is a safe and valid higher bid.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand, and I know there are 8 digits in total for each player. Given that the bid history shows an increase from 2 8s to 3 8s, my opponent seems to be trying to accumulate information or push the limit. Since I have one 8 and my opponent has already bid 3 8s, I should consider if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. Given that I only have one 8 and it's unlikely that between us we have more than 3 8s in total, I should challenge this bid to gain an advantage.
