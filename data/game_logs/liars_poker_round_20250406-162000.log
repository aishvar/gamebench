Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two 5s in my hand, I'll start with a conservative bid that reflects my hand strength. Bidding 2 5s is a safe initial move.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand, so for the current bid of 2 5s to be true, the opponent only needs at least one 5, which is quite plausible. Making a minimal higher bid is strategically safer here. I also have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s is a reasonable next move, increasing both the quantity and changing the digit to one I hold multiple of.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand (50571963). The current bid is 3 8s, which means Player 1 is claiming there are at least three 8s in total across both hands. Since I have zero, it's unlikely Player 1 has three 8s in their hand (as the maximum possible is 8 digits per player). Therefore, challenging seems like the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) challenges Player 1's (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bid of 3 8s.
