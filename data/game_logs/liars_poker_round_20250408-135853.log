--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. In my hand, I have no 9s, making it less likely that there are three or more 9s across both hands. Since the total number of digits is 16, and I have visibility on half of them with zero 9s, the probability of there being three or more 9s in the opponent's hand is low. This makes the bid seem unlikely, so I will challenge.
