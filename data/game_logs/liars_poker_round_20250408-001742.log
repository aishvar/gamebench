Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, providing a solid foundation for a bid. Starting with a lower quantity on a mid-range digit is strategic as it's less likely to be challenged immediately. Bidding 2 5s is safe and sets a manageable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are more than 3 5s in total. However, I have two 8s, so I can safely bid 3 8s, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, making it uncertain if Player 1's bid of 3 8s is valid. Challenging is a strategic move to test if they have at least three 8s, as I have none.
