Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the game, and my hand contains two 5s, two 8s, two 3s, one 2, and one 4. A safe opening bid is to pick a digit I have multiple of, such as 5 or 8. Given that, I'll start with a conservative but reasonable opening bid of 2 5s, reflecting my hand and leaving room to escalate.
