Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid, I can bid any quantity of any digit. I will start with a conservative bid of 1 Queen (Q). This allows me to gather information about my opponent's hand without risking a challenge too early. I have no Queens in my hand, but it's a reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid, so I can bid any valid quantity of any digit. I have three 6s in my hand. Bidding 3 sixes seems reasonable as a starting bid. It's not overly aggressive, but it's not so low that it gives my opponent a large advantage.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. My hand contains only one 6. To exceed the bid, I could raise to a higher digit or higher quantity. However, bidding a higher digit (e.g., 1 9) is safer but allows the opponent to continue. Challenging the bid has an ~85% probability of success since the opponent's 7 hidden digits likely contain fewer than 2 additional 6s (total â‰¤ 2). The risk of losing (15%) is low enough to justify challenging.
