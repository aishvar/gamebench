Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (43213702), I see that I have two 2s. Bidding 2 2s is a safe starting point, as it's the lowest possible valid bid and I know for certain that there are at least two 2s in play.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s and one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 2 2s, which is quite low. Since I have higher digits, I can increase both the quantity and the digit. Bidding 3 4s seems reasonable as I have the 4s to back it up and it raises the bid appropriately.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand, making a total of at least 3 4s possible when combined with the opponent's hand. The current bid is 3 4s, so I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have enough 4s to increase the quantity, I'll bid 3 5s, increasing the digit. This is a reasonable bid based on my hand, as I have one 5.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have two 5s in my hand, making it reasonable to believe that there are at least 4 5s in total. Therefore, I can bid 4 5s, which is a valid higher bid than the current one.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 5s. I don't have any 5s, so I can't increase the quantity of 5s. However, I can bid on a higher digit with a quantity of 4 or more. I have two 7s, so bidding 4 7s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand and two 4s, but no 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, which I find quite high considering I have no 7s. I believe it is unlikely that there are 4 or more 7s in total, especially with the previous bids. Therefore, I will challenge the last bid.
