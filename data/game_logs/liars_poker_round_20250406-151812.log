Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (24632789), I see a mix of digits with no clear majority. However, I notice I have two 2s. A reasonable starting bid could be to bid on the digit I have the most of or a digit that is somewhat common. Since I have two 2s and no other digit appears more than twice, bidding on 2s seems like a good strategy. I'll start with a low quantity to give myself room to maneuver later. Bidding 2 2s is a safe and reasonable starting point.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 93402941, I have one '2'. The current bid is 2 2s, which is plausible given my one '2' and the opponent likely having at least one as well. It's early in the bidding, and raising to 3 2s would be a reasonable next step. Alternatively, since I hold two '4's, I can increase the bid on a digit I have more of, making my bid stronger. Therefore, I will bid 2 4s, which is a higher bid because the digit is higher while maintaining the same quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have one 4 in my hand (24632789), so there are at least 2 fours in total. The next higher bid can be either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. I can bid 2 5s or 3 0s, 3 1s, ..., 3 9s. Since I have a 5 and a 6 in my hand, and there are potentially more 5s or 6s in the other player's hand, bidding 2 5s or 3 5s/3 6s seems reasonable. However, increasing the quantity to 3 with a lower or same digit is also an option. I'll choose to bid 2 5s as it's a conservative increase in the digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 9, 3, 4, 0, 2, 9, 4, 1. There are no 5s in my hand, making it less likely that there are at least two 5s across both hands. However, since the current bid is only 2 5s, and with 16 digits total, it's quite plausible my opponent has two or more 5s. Challenging now is risky. Instead, I can safely raise the bid by increasing the digit but keeping the quantity, as I have two 4s. So bidding 2 6s is risky, but 3 4s is reasonable because I hold two 4s myself, and it's likely my opponent has at least one more 4.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have one 4 in my hand (24632789), so it's possible that there are three 4s in total. However, I also have a 7 and other digits. I can bid higher than 3 4s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit, and I have a 2 and other low digits, making it plausible that there could be three 5s or more when considering both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 93402941, I have zero 5s but two 4s. The current bid is 3 5s, which I cannot confidently support since I have no 5s, making it unlikely there are three or more 5s across both hands. Given my two 4s, a safer move is to increase the digit back to 4s with the same quantity, resulting in a higher bid per rules. Therefore, I will bid 3 6s to increase the digit, or alternatively, I can increase the quantity on 4s to 4 4s, which is more credible based on my hand. Since I hold two 4s, it's plausible there are at least two more 4s in opponentâ€™s hand, making 4 4s a reasonable bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have the digits 24632789, which means I have no 4s in my hand. The total count of 4s across both hands must be at least the number of 4s in Player 1's hand. Since Player 1 bid 4 4s, they likely have at least some 4s. However, given that I have none, it's plausible that they have most of the 4s. Still, bidding 4 5s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit. I can also consider challenging, but given the history and my hand, making a slightly higher bid seems more strategic.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 9, 3, 4, 0, 2, 9, 4, 1. I have zero 5s, so the current bid of 4 5s relies entirely on Player 0 having at least 4 or more 5s, which is quite unlikely given typical distribution. Since 4 of a single digit in one hand is rare and I have none, it's improbable there are 4 or more 5s total. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
