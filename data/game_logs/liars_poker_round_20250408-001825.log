Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: With two 5s in my hand, starting with a bid of 2 5s is a safe and reasonable opening move. It's based on the digits I have, and it's a low bid that's less likely to be challenged immediately.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The current bid is '2 5s', meaning Player 0 claims there are at least 2 fives in total across both hands. Looking at my own hand (59649212), I can see I have one 5. This means there needs to be at least one more 5 in Player 0's hand for their bid to be valid. Since this is a very low and reasonable bid to start with, and I already have one 5 in my hand, it's likely their bid is valid. I should make a higher bid. I have one 9, one 6, one 4, one 2, and two 1s in my hand. I could bid '2 6s' (increasing the digit), '2 9s' (increasing the digit further), or '3 1s' (increasing the quantity). Since I have two 1s in my hand, bidding '3 1s' seems safest as I only need Player 0 to have one 1 for this to be valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 1s. If Player 1 has two or more 1s, the bid is valid, but if not, it's invalid. Given the uncertainty and the risk of the bid being valid, challenging seems like the better option to test the validity of the bid.
