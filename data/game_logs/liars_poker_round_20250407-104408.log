--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, but I'm not confident there are at least five 0s in total. Alternatively, I could bid a higher quantity of a different digit. I have three 9s. The previous bid was 3 9s, so I know at least that many exist. Bidding 5 9s seems like a reasonable increase and leverages information about my hand.
