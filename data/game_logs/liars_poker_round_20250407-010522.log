Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and it's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 79866910. I have two 6s and two 9s, which are my most frequent digits. The total number of digits in play is 16 (2 players * 8 digits). On average, there should be 1.6 of each digit across all hands. Having two 9s is slightly above average. Bidding '3 9s' is a reasonable opening bid. It leverages my strong holding of the highest digit I have multiples of and makes a plausible claim that there's at least one more 9 in the opponent's hand, which is statistically likely.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I can see my entire hand (42532516) and there are no 9s in it. For the opponent's bid of '3 9s' to be true, they would need to have at least 3 nines in their hand since I have zero. While possible, this seems unlikely given they chose this as an opening bid. Since I have perfect information about my hand and know there are zero 9s in it, challenging here is relatively safe - they would need 3+ nines in just their 8 digits for their bid to be valid.
