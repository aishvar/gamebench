Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 27460253. I count 2 fours, 2 fives, and 2 other digits that appear once or twice. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I see. I have two 2s. Bidding 3 2s seems like a safe initial bid as it slightly increases the quantity beyond what I can see in my hand, considering there are 16 digits held by other players.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. The opening bid is '3 2s', which means Player 0 claims there are at least 3 twos among all players' hands. Looking at my own hand (39180454), I have zero 2s. This means that for the bid to be valid, Players 0 and 2 would need to have at least 3 twos between them, which is certainly possible. Since I don't have any 2s, I'm slightly skeptical of this bid, but it's a very reasonable opening bid that could easily be true. I should make a higher bid based on what I do have in my hand. I notice I have two 4s in my hand, so I could bid '3 4s', which would be higher than '3 2s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity. This seems like a safe move that builds on what I know I have.

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains the digits 4, 0, 2, 1, 7, 9, 3, 1. I have one 4 in my hand. The bid needs to be higher than 3 4s. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 4, increasing the quantity seems risky without more information. However, I can try to increase the digit. Bidding 3 5s or higher seems reasonable as I have a 5 and several high digits, but I should be cautious about overbidding.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 27460253. I count 1 '5'. The current bid is 4 5s, which is higher than my count. I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. The next possible bid could be 4 6s, which is a valid higher bid. However, I should first analyze the likelihood of the current bid being true. With 8 digits per player and 3 players, there are 24 digits in total. The current bid of 4 5s implies that at least 4 out of 24 digits are '5'. This is not extremely high, and it's possible. I have 1 '5', so the remaining 2 players must have at least 3 '5's between them. It's a bit tight but not impossible. I will take a cautious approach and bid higher, choosing a different digit that is more likely to be abundant. I see that I have multiple '2's. Bidding on '2's could be a safer option as I already have information about my hand. However, the current bid is on '5's, so I should bid higher than 4 5s. I can bid 4 6s or higher. I have 1 '6', so bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it matches the quantity and increases the digit.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge the bid of '4 6s' or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (39180454), I have zero 6s. For there to be at least 4 sixes total, the other two players would need to have at least 4 sixes between them. This is possible but not guaranteed. I have two 4s in my hand, which suggests 4s might be more common. I could bid '5 4s' which would be a valid higher bid (increasing quantity). Alternatively, I could bid '4 7s', '4 8s', or '4 9s' (same quantity, higher digit). Since I have one 9 in my hand, bidding '4 9s' might be reasonable as the other players would only need 3 more 9s between them. I'll go with '5 4s' since I already have 2 of them in my hand, making it more likely to be true.

Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid can be beaten. My hand contains the digits 4, 0, 2, 1, 7, 9, 3, 1. I have one 4 in my hand. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. Given that the previous bids have been relatively conservative, I should consider if there's a high digit in my hand that could make a strong bid. I have a 7 and a 9, which are high digits but I only have one 7 and one 9. I also have two 1s, but bidding 6 1s might be too aggressive without knowing the distribution of other digits. I will increase the quantity and bid on a higher digit than 4, considering that there are 8 secret digits for each player and the total count for any digit could be high.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. My hand is 27460253, which contains one 5. To determine the likelihood of the bid being true, I need to consider the total count of 5s. I have one 5, so 7 digits are left for the other two players. The bid claims at least 6 5s in total. It's possible that the other players have 5 or more 5s between them. However, bidding higher seems challenging. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. A higher bid could be 7 5s or 6 6s. Given that I don't have information about the other players' hands, I'll analyze the digits I have. I have one 5 and no 6s. Bidding 6 6s might be too aggressive since I don't have any 6s, and it relies on the other players having them. Bidding 7 5s is a safer increase in quantity. I'll choose to bid 7 5s as it's a more reasonable and less risky increase.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher than 7 5s or challenge. Looking at my hand (39180454), I have only one 5. The current bid is 7 5s, which means Player 0 claims there are at least 7 fives among all players. So far, Player 2 has been consistently raising the bid on 5s (from 4 to 6), suggesting they likely have multiple 5s in their hand. Player 0 then raised to 7 5s, which could mean they also have some 5s. Given that I only have one 5, and both other players seem confident about 5s, it's reasonable that there could be 7 or more 5s total. I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, which gives me some confidence. I'll bid 8 4s, increasing the quantity while changing the digit to one I have more of.

Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 4s. I need to determine if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand is 40217931. I have one 4 in my hand. The bid needs to be higher than 8 4s. I can see if I have enough digits to make a higher bid or if challenging is more suitable. Since I have a 4 in my hand, I can consider bidding higher on 4 or another digit. I also need to consider if there's a possibility that there are already 8 or more 4s in total, which seems unlikely given the distribution of digits.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 4S'
Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 9 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 4s. I need to make a bid that is higher than this. I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand is 27460253, which contains two 4s and other digits distributed. To assess the likelihood of the current bid, I count my 4s and see that I have two. This means there are at least two 4s in the game. The remaining 4s could be distributed among the other two players. A bid of 9 4s suggests that the bidder (Player 2) is confident in having a significant number of 4s. However, I can bid 9 5s as it is a higher bid than 9 4s. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 10. Given the distribution and the fact that 4s have been bid upon multiple times, I will take a strategic approach by bidding 9 5s, as it is a safer increase in the bid by changing the digit rather than significantly increasing the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (39180454), I have one 5. The current bid is 9 5s total across all players. For this to be true, there would need to be 8 more 5s between the other two players, meaning they would each need to have 4 5s on average. While possible, this seems unlikely. The bidding has been escalating quickly, with Player 0 and Player 2 repeatedly raising on 5s, suggesting they might have some 5s. However, for there to be 9 total seems high. I only have one 5 in my hand, and it would require the other players to have a very uneven distribution of digits for this to be true. I think challenging is the better option than making a higher bid like 10 5s or 9 6s.
