Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without risking a challenge. I see I have two 4s, which could be a good starting point. The bid should be higher than 0, and I have no information about the other player's hand. A bid of '2 4s' seems reasonable given my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Player 0 bid 2 4s, which is a relatively low bid. I have 2 4s in my hand, so I can safely increase the quantity and digit. Bidding 3 5s seems reasonable, considering my hand and the current bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains a 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0, along with other digits. Since I have one 6, I can reasonably bid on a higher digit or quantity if I think it's possible. The current bid is 3 5s, so I should consider increasing either the quantity or the digit. Given that I have a 6 and a 7, and assuming my opponent might have a few 5s or lower digits, bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit, and I have a 6 in my hand to support this.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have a 6 in my hand, so I can make a bid that increases both quantity and digit. Given my hand, bidding 5 6s seems reasonable.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, and the previous bids suggest that both players have a significant number of digits. Given that I already have two 6s and the bid is 5 6s, I should consider if I can reasonably increase the bid. Since my hand contains a 6 and other digits, I should check if bidding higher is feasible or if challenging is more prudent.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, which seems like a good starting point. However, I don't have any other 6s in my hand, so I should bid a quantity that is higher than 6, but still within a reasonable range. I also want to increase the digit to make the bid more believable. Considering the bid history, I think bidding 7 7s is a good move, as it's a higher quantity and digit than the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 7 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains 4, 3, 8, 7, 9, 0, 6, 7. I have two 7s, which means there are at least 3 sevens in total (including Player 1's hand). Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and there are only 8 digits in each player's hand, bidding 8 7s or higher seems risky without more information. However, I can try to make a valid higher bid. Since my goal is to make a higher bid than 7 7s, I should either increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 6s and two 7s, but no 8s or higher digits. A safe bet would be to increase the quantity or digit slightly if possible. The current bid is 7 7s, so I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. I can bid 8 6s or try to increase the digit. However, I only have two 6s and two 7s. Increasing the digit seems safer.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 8 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. Player 0's bid is 8 8s, which is a high quantity. However, I can still make a valid higher bid by increasing the digit to 9. This way, I'm not committing to a quantity higher than 8, but I'm still making a higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 8 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 8 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 9s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that this bid can be beaten. My hand contains a 4, 3, 7, 9, 0, 6, 7, and 8. I have one 9, but I also have other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and given that the current bid is 8 9s, I should consider if I can safely make a higher bid or if challenging is more prudent.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 9 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 0s. I have 3 0s in my hand. Given the bid history and my hand, I should make a bid higher than 9 0s by increasing the quantity to at least 10, as I have a good chance of finding at least one more 0 among the remaining digits.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 10 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 10 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 0s. Given that there are 16 digits in total and two players, I must assess the likelihood of there being 10 or more 0s in total. My hand contains one 0. The opponent's bid history suggests they might have a few 0s as well. However, considering the distribution and the fact that I have one 0, bidding a higher quantity seems risky without more information. I will challenge the bid as it seems unlikely there are 10 zeros in total, given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and my hand only has one 0.
