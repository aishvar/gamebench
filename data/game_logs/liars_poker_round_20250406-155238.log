Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 40721576, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 7 (two 7s total). Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 7s, as I already hold two 7s myself, making it quite likely that there are at least two 7s in total.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s would be risky as it's a high quantity and I have no information about the other player's hand. I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s is a reasonable increase in digit, and not an unreasonable quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 2 8s, but that doesn't increase the bid significantly. Bidding 3 8s is the most logical next step.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (40721576), I have no 8s, so the current bid of 3 8s relies entirely on the opponent having at least 3 or more 8s, which is unlikely given only 8 digits per player. Since I hold zero 8s, the probability that there are at least 3 total 8s is quite low. Therefore, challenging is the best strategic move.
