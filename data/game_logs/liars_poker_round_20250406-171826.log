Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make an opening bid. I have two 8s in my hand. I will bid a small amount of 8s to start.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider my hand and the possibility of having a higher quantity or digit. My hand contains the digits 9, 2, 9, 5, 2, 6, 4, 0. I have no 8s, but I do have two 9s and two 6s, among other digits. A reasonable bid seems to be increasing the quantity or the digit. I have two 6s and two 9s, so bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit than 8 and I have the numbers to back it up.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I could bid higher, but I don't have strong evidence to support a higher bid. I also have two 8s, and the previous bid was 2 8s. Since the current bid is only 3 6s, I will bid 4 0s to increase the quantity and reset the digit to 0. This is a safer bid than challenging, as I don't have enough information to confidently challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 9, 2, 9, 5, 2, 6, 4, 0. I have a total of 2 zeros, and given that Player 0 has already bid 2 8s and 4 0s, it's possible they have more 0s. However, I also have to consider that my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge if it's unlikely. Since I have two 6s and the last bid was 4 0s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I have one 0 in my hand, so bidding higher on 0s seems risky but doable if I think they have few 0s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 6 0s is a safe increase.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I need to consider the possibility of higher digits or quantities. Since my hand contains a 6 and a 0, and given that the bid history shows increasing interest in lower digits, I should consider if there's a likely higher digit or quantity. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and with 8 digits per player, I have a total of 16 digits in play. The current bid of 6 0s seems high but possible given that there are 16 digits in total and 8 in my hand. I will increase the quantity slightly and choose a digit that could reasonably exist given my hand and the bid history.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding higher on 0s seems risky. I could bid 8 of another digit, but that's also a big jump. Given that the bidding is already at 7, and the maximum is 16, I will challenge. It seems likely that the other player is bluffing.
