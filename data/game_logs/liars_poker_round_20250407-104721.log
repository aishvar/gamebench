Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 6s, one 0, one 2, one 4, and one 1. A safe opening bid would be 2 6s or 2 9s, as I hold two of each, making it likely there could be more in the opponent's hand. To maximize pressure and flexibility, I'll start with 2 9s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '29046169', I have two 0s. The current bid is 3 0s, meaning there must be at least one more 0 in Player 1's hand to make the bid valid. Since each player has 8 digits, it's plausible Player 1 has at least one 0. Making a higher bid of 3 1s is risky as I only have one 1, and increasing quantity or digit doesn't seem advantageous now. The bid of 3 0s is reasonable, so challenging now is premature. Therefore, I will increase the digit while keeping the quantity, bidding 3 1s.
