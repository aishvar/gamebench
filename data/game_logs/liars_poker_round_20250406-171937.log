Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without worrying about being too high. I see I have three 8s in my hand. A bid of 3 8s seems reasonable as a starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. I could bid 3 9s, but that's risky. Bidding 4 of a lower digit is safer. I have two 3s and two 1s. I will bid 4 1s since it is a slightly lower digit than 3.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I need to analyze my hand and the bid history to make a decision. My hand contains the digits: 7, 0, 8, 2, 5, 8, 6, 0. I have a total of 8 digits. The bid of 4 1s seems low, but I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should look for a digit that appears multiple times in my hand or seems likely to appear in my opponent's hand. The digit '8' appears twice in my hand, making it a good candidate for a bid. I also notice that the current bid of 4 1s might be difficult to beat with a higher quantity, so I consider bidding a higher digit with a similar or higher quantity. Given that I have two 8s, I can confidently bid on a higher digit with a reasonable quantity.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. To make a valid bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. I could bid 5 9s, or 6 of any digit. Given that the previous bid was 4 1s, and I have two 1s, bidding 6 1s seems like a reasonable strategy. It's a significant jump in quantity and leverages information from a previous bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 1S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely that the bid is incorrect. My hand contains the digits 7, 0, 8, 2, 5, 8, 6, 0. I have a total of 2 8s and 2 0s, and other digits appear once or not at all. The bid of 6 1s seems high but I have to consider if it's possible for Player 1 to have that many 1s. Since I have two 8s and my previous bid was 5 8s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. A bid of 7 8s seems unlikely given that I only have 2 8s in total, but I can try to bid higher on a different digit. I have two 0s and two 6s, but bidding on 6s or 0s might not be as strategic without knowing the distribution of other digits.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 0S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. It's possible, but not highly likely. I have no 0s in my hand. I could bid higher, but I'm not confident in the number of any particular digit. Challenging seems like a reasonable option, as the probability of there being at least seven 0s is relatively low.
