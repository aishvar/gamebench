Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the opening bid, so I want to start with a conservative but credible bid. Looking at my hand 18946238, I have two 8s, two 3s, and one each of 1, 9, 4, 6, and 2. Since I have two 8s, bidding 3 8s is a safe opening bid, assuming the opponent likely has at least one 8 in their 8 digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (from 99140376). So, there is at least one 8 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about other digits in my hand or the opponent's hand, I'll consider increasing the quantity or keeping the same quantity with a higher digit. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit, and I have one 9 in my hand. This makes my bid plausible.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (1 8 9 4 6 2 3 8), I have one 9. The current bid is 3 9s, which means there must be at least two 9s in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. Since each player holds 8 digits, it's unlikely but possible the opponent has two or more 9s. However, I have two 8s, so a safer and reasonable next bid is to increase the quantity to 4 and revert to 8s, which I know I hold two of. This bid is strictly higher and supported by my hand.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (since my hand is 99140376 and it contains one 8), making the total count so far 2 (one from my hand and assuming the other from Player 0's previous bids and hand). To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 is possible but risky since it would be a relatively high bid. However, I can bid 4 9s, keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit, which is a safer move given the current state. My hand has a 9, so it's plausible that there are at least four 9s in total.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (18946238), I have two 9s. The current bid is 4 9s, so for that to be valid, there must be at least two more 9s in Player 1's hand. Given only 8 digits per hand, it's unlikely Player 1 has 2 or more 9s, making a total of 4 quite improbable. Since increasing the bid would be risky and unlikely to be true, the best move is to challenge.
