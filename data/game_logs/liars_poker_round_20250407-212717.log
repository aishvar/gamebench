Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have the digits 0, 6, 9, 2, 6, 7, 0, 7. Counting the occurrences: 0 appears twice, 6 appears twice, 7 appears twice, 2 and 9 appear once each. The most frequent digits in my hand are 0, 6, and 7, each appearing twice. To open conservatively, I will bid 2 zeros since I know I have at least two, and there is a good chance the opponent has at least one zero, making this a safe opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher than '2 0s' or challenge. Looking at my hand (94314883), I have zero '0' digits. Since there are only 16 total digits in the game (8 in my hand, 8 in my opponent's hand), and I know I have zero '0's, there can be at most 8 '0's in my opponent's hand. The current bid is '2 0s', which claims there are at least 2 '0's total. Since I have none, this means my opponent would need to have at least 2 '0's in their hand for this bid to be valid. This is certainly possible, so challenging would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I could bid '3 0s', but since I don't have any '0's, I'd prefer to bid on a digit I actually have. Looking at my hand, I have two '8's and one '3', '4', '1', '9'. I'll bid '2 3s', which is higher than '2 0s' because the digit is higher while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold the digits 0, 6, 9, 2, 6, 7, 0, 7. In my hand, I have zero 3s. The current bid is 2 3s, meaning there should be at least two 3s among both hands. Since I have none, all 3s must be in Player 1's hand. While it's possible they have two or more 3s, it's statistically unlikely given only 8 digits. Itâ€™s safer to challenge this bid rather than increase it or risk overcommitting.
