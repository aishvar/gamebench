Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the likelihood of there being at least one 0 overall is plausible, making a challenge on 1 0s risky. To maintain pressure and control the game, I will make a minimal but strictly higher bid by increasing the digit to 1 1s. I have one '1' in my hand, so bidding 1 1s is safe and valid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 17931235, I have one 1, one 2, two 3s, one 5, one 7, and one 9. The current bid is 1 2s, which is quite low, and I know I have exactly one 2. Since the total digits are 16, and the bid is minimal, there is no reason to challenge. A safe and strategic move is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, so I will bid 1 3s, leveraging the fact that I have two 3s, making this bid well-supported.
