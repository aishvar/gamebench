Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I need to make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I see one 9, one 6, one 3, one 4, one 8, one 1, one 0, and another 1. I have two 1s, which is the highest count of any digit in my hand. A conservative but solid opening bid would be 2 1s, as I already possess that many myself, making it quite safe.
