--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 7, one 8, and two 4s (totaling two 4s). A safe and reasonable opening bid is '2 4s' because I hold two 4s myself, making it likely there are at least two 4s in total.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. My hand contains two 8s. Bidding 2 8s is a valid higher bid since the digit (8) is higher than 4 while maintaining the same quantity. This bid is safe because my two 8s ensure the total count is at least 2, making it valid even if the opponent has none.

Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8 and two 4s. The current bid is 2 8s, which is plausible given my single 8 and the opponent likely having at least one 8. To increase the bid, I can either go to 3 0s or 3 4s. Since I hold two 4s, bidding 3 4s is relatively safe and increases the quantity, making it a valid higher bid.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid due to the higher digit. I have two 8s in my hand, so if the opponent has at least one 8, the bid could hold. This shifts the focus to a digit I have more of, increasing the pressure on them to either challenge or raise further.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 8S'
Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. The current bid is 3 8s, which requires there to be at least two more 8s in the opponent's hand. That is plausible, but uncertain. Alternatively, I have two 4s in my hand, and since the previous bid on 4s was 3 4s, I can reasonably increase the bid to 4 4s, as it only requires two 4s in the opponent's hand, which is about as likely as the current bid. This is a safer strategic move than challenging now.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 4S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 8s, bidding 4 8s raises the digit (8 > 4) while maintaining the same quantity. This shifts focus to a digit I have more of, making the bid plausible if the opponent has at least two 8s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 8S'
Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. The opponent has 8 unknown digits, so for the current bid of 4 8s to be valid, there must be at least 3 more 8s in their hand, which is unlikely given the distribution. Since 4 of a specific digit across 16 total digits is already a moderately high bid, and I only see one 8 myself, it's risky to accept this bid. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
