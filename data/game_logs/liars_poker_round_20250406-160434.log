Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 12669271. I have two 1s, two 2s, and two 6s. As the first bidder, I should make a relatively safe bid based on my hand. There are 16 digits in total (2 players * 8 digits). On average, there are 1.6 of each digit. Since I have two 2s, bidding '3 2s' is statistically plausible (2 in my hand + expecting ~1.6 in the opponent's hand). This is a reasonable opening bid based on the strength of my hand for the digit 2.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 2s, so the current bid of 3 2s relies entirely on the opponent having at least 3 twos, which is plausible but not certain. To outbid, I can either increase the digit at the same quantity or increase the quantity. I have three 3s in my hand, so bidding 3 3s is a safe and legal higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This leverages my strong holding of 3s and puts pressure back on the opponent.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have zero 3s in my hand (12669271). For the bid to be true, the opponent must have at least three 3s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, challenging a low bid like 3 is risky. Instead, I can make a higher bid based on my hand. I have two 1s, two 2s, and two 6s. My previous bid was 3 2s. The opponent didn't challenge and bid 3 3s. Bidding 3 6s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Since I have two 6s, this bid only requires the opponent to have one 6, which is reasonably likely. This seems safer than challenging or jumping to a quantity of 4.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 54336540, I have two 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, so with my two 6s, the opponent would only need to have one 6 to make the bid valid. Given the distribution of digits, it's quite plausible the opponent has at least one 6. Challenging now is risky. To bid higher, I can either increase the digit to 7 (bid 3 7s) or increase the quantity to 4 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have no 7s, so bidding 3 7s is risky. For quantity, I have three 3s and two 5s, but the current bid is on 6s. I don't have enough confidence in other digits to jump to 4s there. However, since I have three 3s, bidding 4 3s is reasonable, as the opponent only needs one 3 to make that plausible. Therefore, the safest strategic move is to bid 4 3s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 11226679, containing two 1s, two 2s, and two 6s. The current bid is 4 3s made by Player 1. I have zero 3s, meaning Player 1 would need at least four 3s in their 8-digit hand for the bid to be true. While Player 1 has bid 3s twice (3 3s, then 4 3s), requiring four specific digits in one hand is statistically significant. Challenging is an option, but Player 1's persistence makes it risky. My previous bid was 3 6s, which Player 1 did not challenge. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 4 6s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires only two 6s from Player 1's hand for the total count to be four, which is statistically more plausible than Player 1 holding four 3s. This move leverages my hand strength in 6s and follows up on my unchallenged previous bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 54336540, I have two 6s. The current bid is 4 6s, so there need to be at least two more 6s in Player 0's hand to make the bid valid. With only 8 digits in their hand, having two or more additional 6s is possible but somewhat unlikely. Since the bid is already at 4 and I only see two 6s, I assess that challenging is a good strategy because it's risky for the opponent to have that many 6s collectively.
