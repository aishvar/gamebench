Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. I have two 6s, two 8s, one 5, and one 7 in my hand. A conservative bid would be 1 5s, but I can be more aggressive. I'll bid 2 6s, as I have two 6s and it's a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 6s, so all 6s would have to be in the opponent's hand to meet the current bid of 2 6s, which is possible but not guaranteed. Since the bid is quite low, challenging now is risky. A safe and strategic move is to increase the bid slightly with a digit I have many of. I have three 1s, so bidding 3 1s increases the quantity and is well supported by my hand.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. Bidding 4 1s would be a reasonable bluff, increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have, like 6. I have two 6s, so bidding 3 6s would be a valid bid, but it doesn't significantly increase the difficulty for the opponent. Since the opponent bid 3 1s despite me having bid 2 6s previously, they may be bluffing. Increasing the quantity of the same digit (1s) seems like a good strategy to test their bluff. I'll bid 4 1s.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 1s. The current bid is 4 1s, which means the opponent is claiming that there are at least four 1s in total. Since I hold three, this would require the opponent to have at least one 1, which is plausible. Making a higher bid on 1s is risky, but I can instead increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have two 4s, so bidding 4 4s is a reasonable next bid, as it increases the digit and is supported by my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 4S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 4s requires either increasing the quantity to 5 or more, or keeping the quantity at 4 and increasing the digit to 5 or more. Given I have two 6s, bidding 5 6s is a possibility, but it's a fairly high bid. However, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit relatively low seems safer. I have two 8s. Bidding 5 8s is a reasonable option. I will bid 5 8s.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains no 8s, making the current bid of 5 8s highly suspect. Since there are 16 digits total and I have zero 8s, Player 0 would need to have all 5 or more 8s in their hand for the bid to be valid, which is extremely unlikely. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
