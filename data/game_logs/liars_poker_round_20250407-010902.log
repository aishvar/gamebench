Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 09632895. I have two 9s, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. The total number of digits in play is 16 (2 players * 8 digits). Statistically, each digit is expected to appear 1.6 times. Since I already have two 9s, bidding '2 9s' is a very safe opening bid and likely true. It establishes a baseline based on my strongest digit.
