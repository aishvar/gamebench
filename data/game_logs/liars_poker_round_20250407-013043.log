Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 8s, two 9s, one 1, one 2, and one 7. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, as I hold two 5s myself, making it likely there are at least two 5s total.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 2 5S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 5s
