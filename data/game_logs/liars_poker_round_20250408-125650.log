Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I can make an opening bid. I have two 6s in my hand. I will bid a small amount to start.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 94600389, which contains one '6'. The current bid is '2 6s', meaning there must be at least two '6's total between both players. Since I already have one '6', it is plausible the other player has at least one '6' as well. The current bid is modest and likely accurate. Therefore, instead of challenging, I will make a slightly higher bid that I am confident in. I have two '9's in my hand, making '2 9s' a safe and conservative bid that is strictly higher than '2 6s' (same quantity but higher digit).

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have two 6s in my hand. I don't have any 9s. I could bid 3 0s, 3 1s, 3 2s, 3 3s, 3 4s, 3 5s, 3 6s, 3 7s, or 3 8s. I will bid 3 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 zeros. I have two zeros in my own hand (digits: 94600389), which already covers most of the bid. Given that the opponent has 8 digits as well, it's quite likely there's at least one more zero among their digits. Therefore, challenging isn't wise. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have two 9s, making a total of two known to me. To bid safely, I can raise the digit to something I already have multiple of. Since bidding must be strictly higher, I will bid 3 9s, as I already hold two, and it's reasonable to assume at least one more 9 exists in the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding higher would require me to increase the quantity or the digit. I could bid 4 0s, but that's not much of an increase. Given that the previous bid was 3 0s, and now 3 9s, it seems like Player 1 is trying to bluff. I don't have strong evidence to challenge, but I also don't want to keep raising the bid without having any of the target digits. I'll bid 4 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two '0's. The current bid is 4 '0's, meaning the opponent claims at least two more '0's. Given there are 16 digits total and I already have two '0's, it's plausible the opponent has two or more '0's. Thus, challenging seems risky. Instead, I notice I also have two '9's, and previously bid on '9's. If the opponent had none, they might have challenged earlier. So, bidding a higher quantity of '9's seems safer and more strategic.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. The highest possible number of 9s is 16. It's possible, but unlikely. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity to 5 and choosing a low digit like 0 or 1. However, it's safer to challenge since the bid is already at 4.
