Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o1-2024-12-17), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 6s in my hand, so the opponent would need all three 6s in their eight digits. The probability they have at least three 6s is quite low, making it very unlikely that the bid is accurate. Challenging is therefore the best move.
