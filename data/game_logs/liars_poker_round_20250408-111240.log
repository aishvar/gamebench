Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 63743869. I see I have two 3s and two 6s, and other digits appear once or not at all. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and consider the total count across both players. Since there are 8 digits per player, there are 16 digits in total. A bid of 3 6s seems like a good starting point because it's a digit I have, and it's a moderate quantity that doesn't overcommit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 5, 3, 2, 5, 7, 0, 8, 4. I have zero 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, meaning there must be at least three 6s across both hands. Since I have none, all three would have to be in Player 0's hand, which is unlikely but possible. Statistically, the expected number of 6s in 16 digits is about 1.6 (16 * 0.1). Having three or more is on the higher side of probability, and given I have zero, it's risky for Player 0. Therefore, challenging now is the best move.
