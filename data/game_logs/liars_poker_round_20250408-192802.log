Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: There are no bids yet, so I can safely start with a bid that I know is supported by my hand. I have two '1s' in my hand, which guarantees that there are at least two 1s in play. Bidding '2 1s' is a conservative yet credible opening that uses information from my hand without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 65431582, I have one 1. The current bid of '2 1s' claims there are at least two 1s total between both hands. Since I have one 1, this is quite plausible that the opponent has at least one more 1. I could challenge, but it's risky since the bid is quite conservative. Instead, I'll make a strategic bid based on what I see in my hand. I have one 5, so bidding '2 5s' would be a safe increase in digit value while keeping the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s, but I hold a 7 in my hand. By bidding 2 7s, I make the minimal legal raise (same quantity, but a higher digit) and add a bid on a digit I have. Since I have one 7, I only need my opponent to have at least one more 7 among their 8 digitsâ€”which is roughly a 57% chance. This bid is a plausible, low-risk escalation given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, but the opponent bid '2 7s'. With 8 digits in each hand, it's quite possible they have 2 or more 7s. Since the bid is relatively low (only claiming 2), challenging would be risky. Looking at my hand (65431582), I have one 8, so I can safely bid '2 8s', which is valid as it keeps the same quantity but uses a higher digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I notice that my hand contains two 1s (from my earlier bid of 2 1s), and using a higher quantity bid lets me switch back to a digit I have support in. By bidding '3 1s', I only need the opponent to have at least one additional 1 among their 8 unknown digits, which has roughly a 57% chance. This bid is strictly higher than the current bid of '2 8s' because the quantity is increased, and it plays to the strength of my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand (65431582). The opponent bid '3 1s', claiming there are at least 3 ones total. Since I only have one 1, this means they would need to have at least two 1s in their hand for their bid to be true. While possible, I can see their earlier bids were cautious (starting with '2 1s'). Given I have direct knowledge of only one 1, and their bidding pattern suggests uncertainty, challenging here is safer than making a higher bid which would require claiming 4 or more of any digit.
