Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but not guaranteed. Since it's the opening low bid, it's very safe to increase it. I notice I have two 3s and two 8s, so a straightforward stronger bid is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Moving from 1 0s to 1 8s leverages my two 8s and pressures the opponent without overcommitting.

Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 1 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s (digits: 8, 5, 7, 1, 8, 3, 3, 6). The current bid is only 1 9s, which is quite low. Since I have two 8s, it is very likely there are at least two 8s total. Therefore, I can confidently raise the bid to 2 8s, which is a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and leverages my strong hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 85718336, I have zero 9s, so the current bid of 2 9s relies entirely on Player 0 holding both 9s, which is improbable. Since the total number of 9s across 16 digits is unlikely to be 2 when I have none, challenging is statistically favorable here.
