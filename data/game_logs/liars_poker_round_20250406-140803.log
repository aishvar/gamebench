Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains the digits 3, 7, 0, 1, 4, 3, 2, and 8. I see that I have two 3s and two 4s, but no other repeated digits. I also have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 7, and one 8. Given that I have two 3s and my goal is to make a reasonable bid that could potentially be valid or challenging for others, bidding 2 3s seems like a good starting point as it reflects a true count from my hand and leaves room for others to have the digit as well.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (09026146), I don't have any 3s. The current bid is only 2 3s, which is quite low considering there are 24 total digits in play. Even without any 3s in my hand, it's very possible that between the other two players' 16 digits, there are at least 2 3s. I could challenge, but it seems risky given how low the bid is. Instead, I'll make a higher bid based on what I actually have in my hand. I see I have one 0, one 9, one 2, one 6, one 4, and two 1s. Since I have two 1s, I can confidently bid on 1s. I'll bid 3 1s, which is higher than 2 3s because it has a higher quantity.

Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 8 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I see one 8 and it's higher than 1, I can bid 3 8s. This is a reasonable bid as it increases the digit and is based on my hand.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have the digits 3, 7, 0, 1, 4, 3, 2, 8 in my hand. I can see that there are at least 3 8s in total if I consider Player 2's bid. Given that I have one 8 and two 3s, and considering the previous bids, I should try to make a higher bid. The current bid is 3 8s, so I need to bid higher than this. I have two 3s and two 8s are already in play, so bidding 4 8s seems reasonable if I consider that other players might have 8s as well.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (09026146), I don't have any 8s. The current bid is 4 8s, meaning Player 0 thinks there are at least 4 8s total among all players. Since Player 2 previously bid 3 8s, they likely have at least 1-2 8s in their hand. Player 0 increased this to 4 8s, suggesting they might have 1-2 8s as well. With 24 total digits in play and no 8s in my hand, it's certainly possible there are 4 or more 8s. I need to either challenge or make a higher bid. I have one 9 in my hand, so I could bid 4 9s (same quantity, higher digit). This seems safer than challenging, as 4 8s is a reasonable bid.

Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have the hand 53549886, which contains no 9s. The bid of 4 9s implies that there are at least four 9s across all players' hands. Given that I have 8 digits and none of them are 9s, the other two players must have at least four 9s between them. This seems unlikely but not impossible. However, I can bid higher. The next possible bid could be to increase the quantity or the digit. Since the digit is already 9, the highest possible digit, I must increase the quantity. Bidding 5 9s is the next logical step, but it's a risky move as it implies at least five 9s across all hands. I'll take a chance and bid 5 9s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 3, 7, 0, 1, 4, 3, 2, 8. I have two 3s, which could be useful. However, bidding higher than 5 would require me to have a good chance of having a higher quantity or digit than the current bid. Since I don't have a clear count of other players' digits, I must assess the risk. The current bid is quite high, and challenging seems risky without more information. I will try to make a slightly higher bid by increasing the quantity or digit. Given my hand, bidding 6 0s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit and I have at least two 0s and two 3s but no 9s.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to assess whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of '6 0s'. In my hand, I have one 0, which means there would need to be at least 5 more zeros among the other players' hands to make the bid valid. With 3 players and 8 digits each, there are 24 total digits. The probability of having 6 or more zeros out of 24 digits is reasonable. Since I have one 0 myself, I need to decide if 5 more zeros between the other two players is likely. I could bid higher, but I'm somewhat suspicious of this bid. Looking at the bidding history, we've seen escalating bids from 2 3s all the way to 6 0s, with players increasing either the quantity or the digit. Given that I have only one 0 and would need to bid at least '6 1s' or '7 0s', I think challenging is the better option here. The current bid seems optimistic.
