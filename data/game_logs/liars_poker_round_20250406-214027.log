Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I need to open with a reasonable starting bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 4s, two 8s, one 1, two 3s, and one 2. The most common digits in my hand are 3, 4, and 8, each appearing twice. With 16 total digits in play, it's statistically safe to start with a conservative bid of 3 of one of these digits. I'll choose 3 3s as my opening bid, reflecting my two 3s and likely at least one in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. Looking at my hand, 98671042, I notice I have one 3 and other digits. Since I only have one 3, bidding higher on 3s might not be the best strategy without knowing the other player's hand. However, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Given my hand does not offer a clear advantage in any particular digit to safely increase the quantity significantly, I should consider challenging or making a strategic bid. Challenging seems risky without more information about the opponent's hand, but making a bid that is too high could also backfire. A moderate increase, considering the digits I have and their potential distribution, seems prudent. I have two 1s and other unique digits, but increasing to a higher digit like 4 or more might be risky. Noticing I have no 4s but do have digits that could potentially match or exceed a bid of 3 in other numbers, I could consider bidding on a different digit or challenging if I felt the current bid was highly unlikely. Given my hand and the goal to make a higher bid, I must weigh the risks and potential rewards. Since my hand doesn't strongly support a significantly higher bid in any specific digit without more information, and considering the rules of the game, I should look for a digit that could reasonably have a higher count when combined with the opponent's hand. However, without clear evidence to safely make a much higher bid, I must decide based on the information I have and the potential for the opponent's hand to contribute to the total count of any digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 43132846, I have zero 1s, so the opponent is claiming there are at least four 1s between both hands. Since I hold none, all four would need to be in Player 1's hand, which is highly improbable given only 8 digits. The chance of someone having four or more of a single digit is quite low, so it's statistically unlikely the bid is valid.
