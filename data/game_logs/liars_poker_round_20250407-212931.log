Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player to bid, I need to establish a starting bid that reflects a reasonable estimate of the total count of a specific digit across both hands. My hand contains eight digits: 9, 3, 8, 8, 7, 3, 9, 0. This gives me a strong presence of 9s (2), 3s (2), and 8s (2). Starting with a bid of 2 for one of these digits is reasonable since it sets a baseline for the game without overcommitting. I choose the digit 9 because it is common in my hand and likely to appear in the opponent's hand as well.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 nines. In my hand (64022581), there are zero 9s. Since I have no 9s, this means the entire count of nines depends solely on my opponent's hand. For the bid to be valid, Player 0 must have at least 2 nines. While it's possible, it's statistically unlikely to have two or more 9s in one 8-digit hand (~7% chance). Given this low probability, challenging is the optimal move.
