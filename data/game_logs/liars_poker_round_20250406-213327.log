Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand. Since there's no current bid, I can start by bidding 3 5s, which is a reasonable claim based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Bidding higher than 3 5s is necessary. I have two 8s, so bidding 4 8s is a reasonable option, increasing both the quantity and the digit. While I have a 9, increasing the quantity to 4 feels safer given my hand composition and the lack of 5s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I don't have any 8s in my hand, making it unlikely that there are four 8s across both hands. Challenging this bid is a strategic choice to potentially win the game if the actual count is less than four.
