Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, making the current bid of 1 0s plausible since Player 0 might have one zero. Since the bid is very low, it's usually better to increase the bid to gather more information and apply pressure. I notice I have two 6s. A safe and natural escalation is to bid 2 6s, which is strictly higher both in quantity and digit, and supported by my own hand.
