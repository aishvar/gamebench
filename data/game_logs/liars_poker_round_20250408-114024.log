Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start with any bid. Bidding 2 7s seems reasonable, as I'm aware of my own hand and can make an informed decision.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. Since I have zero 7s in my hand (my digits are 0,8,5,8,6,2,0,2), the opponent must have at least two 7s. However, raising the bid to 2 8s is safer because I have two 8s, making the bid valid even if the opponent has none. This avoids challenging a bid that could be true and allows me to maintain control of the game.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 7 and a 5 in my hand, but no 8s. The current bid is only 2 8s. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 7S'
Player 0 bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 3 8s increases the digit while keeping the same quantity, which is valid. I have two 8s in my hand, so if the opponent has at least one 8, the total will meet the bid. This seems a safer option than challenging, as the opponent might have additional 8s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. Since I have one 8 in my hand, I can increase both the quantity and digit by bidding 4 9s. This is a reasonable move based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 9S'
Player 0 bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. My hand has no 9s, so the opponent must have at least four. Since the bid suddenly shifted to 9s after bidding on 7s/8s, it's likely a bluff. Challenging gives a chance to win if they have fewer than four 9s.
