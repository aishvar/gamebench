Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is 1 0s, there is a reasonable chance that the opponent has at least one more 0, making a bid of 2 0s plausible. Additionally, since it's early in the game with a low bid, it's strategic to raise incrementally rather than challenge immediately.
