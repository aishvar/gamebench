Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 96085987, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Since I must raise, the lowest valid higher bid is 1 1s. I have one 9, two 8s, one 6, and one 5, so I could make a slightly stronger bid. I have two 8s, so bidding 2 8s is a safe and modest increase, reflecting my actual hand strength without overcommitting early.
