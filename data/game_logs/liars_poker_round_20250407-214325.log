Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 zero. Looking at my hand '30727989', I have one zero myself. Since I know there is at least one zero in total, Player 0's bid of 1 zero is certainly valid. A minimal safe raise would be to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, or to increase the quantity. The next valid bids after '1 0s' would be '1 1s', '1 2s', ..., or '2 0s'. I have two 7s in my hand, so a strong incremental bid would be '2 7s', which is quite plausible. However, a conservative and safe increment is to bid '1 3s' since I have one 3, and it's a minimal legal raise. To maintain strategic pressure, I'll bid '1 3s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 4s. Looking at my hand (30727989), I have zero 4s. Since I hold 8 digits, and the opponent holds 8 digits, the total number of 4s across both hands can be at most 16. However, since I have zero 4s, the entire bid hinges on whether the opponent has at least one 4. Given the naive 50/50 opponent, the probability they have at least one 4 is roughly 1 minus the probability they have zero 4s. The chance they have no 4s is (9/10)^8 â‰ˆ 0.43, so the chance they have at least one 4 is about 57%. Given this, the bid of 1 4s is plausible but uncertain. Since the bid is minimal and quite likely to be true, challenging now is risky. Instead, I can safely increase the bid conservatively to 1 5s, as I hold one 5 in my hand (digit '5' is absent; correction: no 5s in my hand). Actually, I have no 5s, so bidding 1 5s is risky. Checking for other digits: I have two 7s, so I can confidently bid 2 7s, which raises the quantity, a valid bid. This is a safe and strong bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 7s and two 8s. The current bid is 2 8s. Since I already have exactly 2 eights, it's plausible Player 0 has none, but they might have one or more. Challenging now is risky because the bid is consistent with my hand alone. To increase pressure and maintain control, I can safely raise to 3 sevens, as I hold two 7s and it's likely Player 0 has at least one 7 in their eight digits. This is a safe incremental bid that exceeds the current bid by quantity and maintains credibility.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 30727989, I have two 8s. For Player 0's bid of 3 8s to be valid, they must have at least one 8, which is plausible. However, since I have 2 out of 8 possible 8s, the likelihood that Player 0 has at least one 8 is moderate but not guaranteed. Player 0 is naive and might be bluffing or overestimating. The total number of 8s could be 2 or 3, but pushing beyond 3 would be risky. A higher bid would require calling at least 4 of some digit, which seems unlikely with my hand only supporting 2 8s and 2 7s. Given the current bid of 3 8s and my knowledge, challenging is the best move since the probability Player 0 has 1 or more 8s is not high enough to confidently bid higher.
