Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s is reasonable. Since I must raise the bid, the safest minimal increment is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I see I have two 6s, so bidding 1 6s is a safe and legal next bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 1 6S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 1 6s
