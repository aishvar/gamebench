--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 5s, two 8s, one 1, and one 3. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be 2 of one of these digits. I'll choose 2 5s as my opening bid because I hold two 5s myself, making it quite likely that there are at least two 5s across both hands.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 8, 0, 1, 3, 5, 5, 0, 9. I have zero 6s. The current bid is 2 6s, which requires at least two 6s across both hands. Since I have none, all 6s must be in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. The probability that Player 1 has at least two 6s among their 8 digits is relatively low (~15%). Given this low likelihood and no evidence of many 6s, challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 1's (Naive 50/50) bid of 2 6s.
