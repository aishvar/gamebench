Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and need to make the first bid. My hand is 89552149. I have two 5s and two 9s, which are my most frequent digits. The expected number of any digit across the total 16 digits is 1.6. Having two 5s means it's statistically likely (probability > 50%) that there is at least one more 5 among the opponent's 8 digits. Therefore, bidding '3 5s' is a reasonable opening bid based on my hand, establishing a baseline and requiring the opponent to have at least one 5 for the bid to be true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains a single '5', meaning I only contribute one '5' towards the total. The current bid is 3 '5s', which is plausible since the opponent likely has at least two. However, I notice my hand has a diverse set of digits with no repeats, making it risky to increase the quantity of '5s'. Instead, I can safely bid higher by keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit. I have one '6' and one '7', making it reasonable to bid '3 6s', as it's plausible the opponent has at least two '6s'. This is a cautious yet valid increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand (89552149). For the bid to be accurate, the opponent (Player 1) must have at least three 6s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a single player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively low (approximately 3.8% based on binomial probability with p=0.1). Given I hold none of the bid digit, the likelihood of the current bid being true is significantly reduced. Therefore, challenging is the statistically favorable move.
