Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s is definitely valid. Since I must make a strictly higher bid, and I know there are at least two 0s total, a safe and natural next move is to bid 2 0s, which is likely to be true and puts pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s, zero 1s, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 9, and one 9. Since I have no 1s, and the current bid is 2 1s, it relies entirely on Player 0 having at least two 1s, which is unlikely given a naive distribution (expected roughly 1.6 of any digit per player). It is risky to increase the bid on 1s without any in my hand. Instead, I can make a higher bid on a digit I hold multiple of. I have two 0s, so bidding 3 0s is reasonable â€” it's a minimal increase and plausible that the opponent has at least one 0, making the total at least 3. This is safer than challenging now or bidding on 1s.
