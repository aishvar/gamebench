--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 3s, one 6, one 9, one 1, and one 2. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 3s since I already hold two 3s myself, making it likely that the total count is at least two or more.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (89460452), I don't have any 3s. The current bid is only '2 3s', which is quite low given there are 16 total digits in play. Even though I don't have any 3s, it's very possible my opponent has 2 or more 3s, making a challenge risky. I have two 4s in my hand, so I can confidently bid '2 4s', which is valid as it keeps the same quantity but increases the digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 60930312, I have no 4s but I do have two 0s and two 3s. The current bid is 2 4s, which I suspect is plausible given the other player's hand but I cannot know for sure. Since I have two 3s, I can safely increase the bid to 3 3s, which is a strictly higher bid (higher quantity and lower digit is valid). This leverages my knowledge and puts pressure back on the opponent.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 3S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (89460452), I have zero 3s. The opponent bid '3 3s', claiming there are at least 3 threes total. Since I have none, this means they would need to have at least 3 threes in their hand. While possible, this seems somewhat unlikely given they started with a lower bid of '2 3s' earlier. I could bid higher, but with no 3s in my hand, I'm skeptical of their claim and prefer to challenge.
