Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 8, and one 9, so no digit dominates. A safe and standard opening bid is 2 of a digit I hold, to avoid immediately overcommitting. I choose 2 5s, as I have one 5, so it's reasonable to assume there is at least one more 5 between both hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity by one. This bid is likely to be safe, as there are 16 digits in total and it's plausible that another 5 exists in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 5. The current bid is 3 5s, meaning there must be at least two 5s in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. While this is possible, it's still somewhat risky to challenge now. Instead, I can safely increase the bid by keeping the quantity the same but choosing a higher digit I have more of. I have two 4s in my hand, so bidding 3 4s is a safe and valid higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 5. The current bid is 3 5s, which is plausible since I have one and the opponent could reasonably have two or more. It's risky to challenge now. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since I have two 4s, bidding 3 6s is unlikely based on my hand, but I do have one 6, so I can safely bid 3 6s, which is a higher bid with the same quantity and higher digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 4 6s is risky since there are only 16 digits in total, and it's unlikely that there are 3 more 6s. However, challenging might be too early. I'll try to bluff with a modest increase in quantity, bidding 4 7s, as I have one 7 in my hand and hope the opponent doesn't have many.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (52814694), I have one 7. The current bid is 4 7s, so there would need to be at least 3 more 7s in Player 1's hand. Given only 8 digits in their hand, having 3 or more 7s is unlikely, especially since I only have one myself. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
