Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 zero. I have two zeros in my hand. The opponent is a naive player, meaning they are likely to bid randomly. Bidding 2 zeros is a reasonable next step, as it's a small increase and I have the cards to back it up. It's unlikely the naive player has enough zeros to challenge this bid, but it's also not a huge risk if they do.
