Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, which gives me a solid basis for claiming there are at least 2 8s among the 16 total digits. With no current bid, setting an initial bid that I can back up is a strong play. Therefore, I will open with 'BID: 2 8s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. If Player 0 also has one 8, the bid is valid. However, if they don't, the bid is invalid. Challenging this bid is a strategic move to potentially win the round if the actual count is less than 2.
