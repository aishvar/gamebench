Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s, two 2s, and two 3s in my hand. Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make a valid bid. I can start with a bid of 2 1s, which is reasonable given that I have two 1s. This is a low bid, but it establishes my presence in the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 1s in my hand, so I cannot confidently support the current bid of 2 1s. However, I do have two 7s and two 9s, which makes bidding on these digits more reasonable. To increase the bid, I will choose 3 7s, as it is a logical step up in quantity and aligns with my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s and one 1 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which seems unlikely since I have no 7s. I can bid 4 2s, which is a valid higher bid since I have enough 2s in my hand to support it.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 2s. Given my hand, it is reasonable to assume there are more 7s across both hands. By bidding 4 7s, I am matching the quantity of the current bid but increasing the digit, which is a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have two 2s and one 1 in my hand, but no 7s. Given that there are only 16 total digits and the previous bids have been relatively low, I suspect that 4 7s is a stretch. I should challenge this bid as it seems unlikely to be valid.
