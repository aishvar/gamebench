Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the opening move with no current bid. My hand contains the following counts: 0s=0, 1s=0, 2s=2, 3s=1, 4s=2, 5s=0, 6s=1, 7s=1, 8s=0, 9s=0. A safe starting bid is usually on a digit I have multiple of. I have two 2s and two 4s, so a bid of 2 twos or 2 fours is reasonable. Choosing 2 fours (2 4s) as the opening bid, since 4 is a strong digit in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to evaluate whether to challenge or make a higher bid. My hand is 67205919, which contains zero 4s. The current bid is '2 4s', meaning Player 0 claims there are at least 2 fours between our hands. Since I have no 4s in my hand, all claimed 4s must be in Player 0's hand. For the bid to be valid, Player 0 must have at least 2 fours. This is certainly possible, so challenging would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, so I know there are at least 2 nines in the game. Since 9 is higher than 4, I can bid '2 9s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains no 9s, so the total number of 9s depends entirely on the opponent's hand. Since each player has 8 digits, the maximum total 9s across both hands is 16. However, it's statistically unlikely that the opponent has 2 or more 9s, especially given that I have none. The previous bid was 2 4s, and I have three 4s, so that bid was conservative and reasonable. Player 1 then jumped to 2 9s, which seems suspicious considering my lack of 9s. The chance that they have exactly 2 or more 9s is low, making this a good opportunity to challenge.
