Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 6 in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can make a bid with any quantity and digit. Bidding 2 6s seems reasonable, increasing digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider increasing the quantity or the digit. The current bid is low, so I should assess my hand for potential digits to bid on. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit than 6 seems reasonable. I will increase the quantity to 3 and keep the digit as 6 because I have two 6s, making it plausible.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, which is more than the current bid quantity. I can safely increase the quantity to 4 and keep the digit the same, as it is a reasonable assumption based on my hand.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more likely to succeed. My hand contains a 6 and other digits, but I don't have enough information about Player 0's hand. However, I can see that bidding higher than 4 6s seems reasonable if I think there are enough 6s or if I can make a valid higher bid. Since my goal is to make a higher bid, I should look for a digit that I have multiple instances of and bid higher than 4 if possible. I have two 6s in my hand, but bidding 5 or more 6s seems risky without knowing the exact distribution of digits. I will instead focus on a digit I have multiple instances of and try to outbid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. I should increase the bid quantity or digit to make a valid higher bid. Bidding 6 6s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge it. My hand contains the digits 9, 5, 4, 7, 3, 3, 2, and one 6. Given that the bid is 6 6s and I have one 6, I should consider if there's a possibility that the total count of 6s is indeed 6 or more. Since I only have one 6, I must assess if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. The bid history shows a steady increase in the quantity of 6s, but I don't have enough information about Player 0's hand. However, I can see that bidding a higher quantity seems risky without knowing the exact distribution of digits among players. I should consider if challenging could be more beneficial given the high quantity of 6s already bid.
