Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there has been no bid yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 6s, two 5s, one 9, one 4. Opening bids are generally conservative, so I will start by bidding 2 8s, reflecting my known count and leaving room to escalate.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. Given the total of 16 digits, the chance that there are at least two 9s is quite reasonable, which aligns with the current bid. To raise, the minimal valid higher bid is 3 0s (higher quantity), but I lack information about zeros. Alternatively, I can bid 3 8s because I have two 8s, making it plausible that at least one more 8 exists in the opponent's hand, totaling three 8s. This is a safe incremental bid that leverages my strong count of 8s.
