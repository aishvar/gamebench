Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s and two 4s, but no other digits appear more than once. A bid of 2 6s seems reasonable given my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand, so there are at least 1 + 1 = 2 6s in total. The bid is accurate based on my knowledge. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Increasing the quantity to 3 6s seems reasonable. Alternatively, bidding 2 7s is also a valid higher bid. Given that I have multiple 7s and 3s, and no 8s or 9s, bidding 2 7s is a relatively safe and higher bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 2 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 6s, which I can use to inform my bid. Since the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid of 2 7s, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 3 or more 7s seems unlikely given the total number of digits in play is 16. I can try to bid 3 6s or higher, or switch to a higher digit. Given that I have two 6s, bidding 3 6s seems reasonable and increases both quantity and digit compared to 2 7s.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 7 in my hand. The previous bid was 2 7s, and I made that bid, so I know there's at least 2 7s. To make a higher bid than 3 6s, I can either bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I have seen one 7 and there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's, it's reasonable to believe there could be more 7s. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid because it has the same quantity but a higher digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. My hand contains the digits 5, 6, 0, 1, 9, 4, 6, 4. I have two 6s, and the current bid is 3 7s. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 7s or higher digits in quantity, I will increase the digit and try to make a reasonable bid based on my hand. I can see that bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as I have two 6s and it's higher than the current bid of 3 7s.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 and two 7s in my hand. The bid history suggests that Player 0 is trying to focus on 6s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I have two 7s, bidding 4 7s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains 2 sixes and 1 seven, but no 7s to contribute to the count of 7s. Given that the bid is 4 7s and I have no 7s, I should consider if there's a high digit in my hand that could make a valid higher bid. I have two 6s and my highest digit is 6. I could bid higher with 5 6s or 5 6s but I only have 2 sixes. The current bid of 4 7s seems potentially vulnerable if I think Player 1 might not have many 7s. However, I should also consider if I can make a reasonable bid that is higher than 4 7s. Since my hand does not have many high digits, I should think about challenging or making a conservative bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 7 in my hand, and previously, I bid 4 7s. To make a higher bid than 5 6s, I can either bid a quantity higher than 5 or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since my hand contains no 8s or 9s, bidding 5 7s or 5 8s/9s isn't possible. However, I can bid 6 6s, increasing the quantity. Given the back-and-forth bidding on 6s and 7s, it seems both players have some presence of these digits. I will bid 6 6s to continue the game.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. Given my hand (56019464), I have a total of 3 sixes. The bid history shows a gradual increase in both quantity and digit. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid of 6 6s. Since I have three 6s, I can confidently bid a higher quantity of 7 6s or increase the digit. However, bidding 7 6s seems risky without knowing the exact distribution of digits in the opponent's hand. I will increase the digit and bid 7 7s or higher if possible, but I don't have any 7s. Therefore, I will increase the quantity and bid 7 6s, as it seems reasonable and higher than the current bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have one 6 and no 7s in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have any 7s, bidding 7 7s might be too high. However, I can bid 8 6s, increasing the quantity. Given the back-and-forth bidding history, it seems Player 0 is trying to convince me that there are many 6s. I should consider challenging or making a slightly higher bid. Bidding 8 6s seems plausible as it is a relatively small increase in quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 8 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, and the bid history shows a steady increase in the quantity of 6s. Given that I have a total of 4 sixes in my hand (not considering the opponent's hand), I should consider if I can reasonably make a higher bid or challenge. Since my hand contains two 6s and I know there are at least 8 sixes in total (from the bidding history), I should assess if bidding higher is feasible or if challenging is more prudent.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 9 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 9 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 6s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Given that I have the digits 56389377, I can see I have one 6. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in my opponent's, making a total of 16 digits. The current bid of 9 6s implies that my opponent has 8 6s, which is possible but unlikely since it would mean they have all the remaining 6s. However, I do have a 7 and other digits. I can bid higher than 9 6s by bidding 9 7s or 10 0s (since 0 is the lowest digit and 10 is higher than 9). I have one 7, so bidding 9 7s seems feasible if I believe my opponent has a good number of 7s. Alternatively, increasing the quantity to 10 with a lower digit like 0s is also an option if I think there are enough 0s between us. Given the history, Player 0 has been aggressive with 6s, so they might have a strong hand in 6s. I will bid 10 0s as it's a safer bet given the low likelihood of having a very high count of 0s across both hands, and it's a significant jump from the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 0s. Given that there are 16 digits in total and I have 8 digits in my hand, I should assess the likelihood of there being 10 or more 0s in total. Since I have one 0 and a 6, 5, 9, and other higher digits, it's unlikely that Player 1 has many 0s. My hand does not have many 0s, and it's unlikely that Player 1 has 10 or more 0s. I should challenge this bid as it seems highly improbable.
