Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, there are no 0s, so I know there is at most 8 unknown digits in Player 0's hand. The current bid is only 1 zero, which is very plausible given the distribution. Challenging now would be premature. A minimal safe raise is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, so I'll bid 1 1s, which is strictly higher. I have one '1' in my hand, making this bid reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 4, 8, 2, 9, 6, 9, 6, 3. I have one '2', matching the current bid of 1 2s, so it's plausible there may be more 2s in Player 0's hand. Since the bid is still quite low (only 1), it's safe and strategically sound to increase the bid incrementally. I don't have any 3s, but making a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit to 3 is reasonable. Therefore, I will bid 1 3s.

Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 1 4s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 1 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 48296963, I have one 4, two 6s, two 9s, two 3s, and one 8. The current bid is only 1 4s, which is quite low and easily believable, especially since I have a 4 myself. It would be risky to challenge such a low bid. The optimal strategy is to make a minimal but valid higher bid. Since I have two 3s and two 6s, I can safely increase the bid to 1 6s, which is a higher digit but same quantity, maintaining a conservative approach while escalating the bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 1 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 1 6s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 1 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand (digits: 4,8,2,9,6,9,6,3), so the total number of 6s across both hands is at least three. The current bid is only 1 6s, so it is safe and strategic to increase the bid to 3 6s, which is a higher quantity and well-supported by my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 7s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (48296963), I have the digits: 4, 8, 2, 9, 6, 9, 6, 3. There are no 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which requires at least three 7s across both hands. Since I have zero 7s, Player 0 must have all three or more for the bid to be valid. The probability of them having 3 or more 7s in 8 digits is low (roughly 6.5% or less). Given this unlikelihood, challenging is the optimal move.
