Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (35121075), I have: one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 7, and no 4s, 6s, 8s, or 9s. Since I have one 5, and there are 16 total digits in play (8 in my hand, 8 in my opponent's), I can reasonably expect there might be more 5s in my opponent's hand. Making a conservative first bid of '2 5s' seems reasonable - it's likely to be true based on my hand, but not so high that it's easily challenged.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s. Bidding 2 8s is a valid higher bid since 8 is a higher digit than 5, and I can ensure the total count of 8s is at least 2.

--- Turn: Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to either make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '2 8s'. Looking at my hand (35121075), I have zero 8s. Since there are 16 total digits in the game (8 in my hand and 8 in my opponent's hand), and I have none, there can be at most 8 eights in total. The opponent bid '2 8s', which means they're claiming there are at least 2 eights between our hands. Since I have none, this is only true if they have at least 2 eights in their hand. This is certainly possible, so challenging would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I could bid '2 9s' (same quantity, higher digit) or '3' of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s and two 1s, plus one each of 0, 3, and 7. I'll bid '3 1s' since I already have two 1s in my hand, so I only need one more from my opponent's hand for this to be true.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 1S'
Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand. The current bid is 3 1s, which would require Player 0 to have at least two more 1s. This seems unlikely, so I will challenge the bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) challenges Player 0's (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) bid of 3 1s.
