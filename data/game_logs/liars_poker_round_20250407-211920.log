--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my first turn. I should start with a conservative bid to test the waters. Analyzing my hand (0, 8, 7, 2, 9, 8, 3, 6), I have two 8s, which is the highest count of any single digit in my hand. Given that there are only two players and the maximum possible quantity is 16, bidding 2 of a digit seems reasonable. I'll choose digit 8 as it's the highest count I have.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (60397754), there are zero 8s. The current bid is 2 8s, which means there must be at least two 8s across both hands. Since I have none, all 2 (or more) 8s must be in Player 0's hand. The probability that Player 0 has exactly two or more 8s among their 8 digits is relatively low (roughly 23% chance for exactly 2, less for more). Given this low likelihood and no evidence to suggest Player 0 is bluffing conservatively, challenging is statistically favorable.
