Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 80668492. I count 2 zeros, 1 eight, 3 sixes, 1 four, 1 nine, and 0 of other digits. A reasonable starting bid should reflect a likely quantity and digit. Since I have 3 sixes, bidding '3 6s' seems like a good starting point as it reflects a relatively high quantity of a digit I know exists in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6. Since the current bid is 3 6s, it requires at least two more 6s in the opponent's hand, which is plausible. To outbid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 1s and two 0s, so bidding 3 1s or 3 0s is a lateral bid and not higher. I also have one 3, one 4, one 9, and one 8, but no strong counts there. The safest higher bid is 3 7s, increasing the digit while keeping quantity the same, which is a minimal raise and keeps me in the game without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (80668492), and since there are two players with 8 digits each, there are a total of 16 digits in play. The current bid implies that there are at least 3 7s in total. I have one 7, so there must be at least 2 more 7s in the opponent's hand, which is plausible. However, I also notice that I have multiple 8s and 6s in my hand. Given that my hand has a good number of 8s, I can make a higher bid by switching to 8s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit. I will make this bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '01163498', I have exactly one 8. To justify the current bid of 3 8s, the opponent would need to have at least two 8s, which is plausible but not guaranteed. Bidding 3 9s is a minimal raise and reasonable since I also have one 9, making it likely there are at least three 9s combined. This is safer than challenging now, as 3 8s is still quite plausible.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 9S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (80668492), and since there are two players with 8 digits each, the total count of 9s could be anywhere from 1 (if the other player has none) to 2 (if the other player has one 9). Bidding higher than 3 9s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit is not possible since it's already 9. So, I need to increase the quantity to 4. Given that the maximum possible count for any digit is 16 and we are starting with 8 digits each, a bid of 4 for any digit is plausible. Since I have one 9, bidding 4 9s implies the other player has at least 3 nines, which is possible but unlikely. However, I can bid 4 0s, increasing the quantity and changing the digit to the lowest possible, which is a relatively safe move as it changes the digit and is not directly related to my hand's strength on 9s. My hand has one 8 and no 9s were visible in my last bid's context, but I do have a zero. The safer and more strategic move seems to be to bid 4 0s.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s. The current bid is 4 0s, so there would need to be at least two more 0s in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. Given only 8 digits in their hand, expecting 4 total 0s is somewhat risky but plausible. However, since I already hold two, it's less likely the opponent has two or more 0s. The bid is aggressive, and challenging here is a reasonable move.
