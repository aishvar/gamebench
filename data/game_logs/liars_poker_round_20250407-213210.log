Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand (58266351), the digit that appears most frequently is '6', which occurs twice. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 sixes, as I have two myself and it's likely there could be more in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have the digits 4, 4, 9, 2, 8, 3, 0, 7 in my hand, which means I have no 6s. Since I cannot challenge the bid with 2 6s, I need to either make a new bid or challenge the current one. Given that I have no 6s, I can assume that it's unlikely for Player 0 to have 2 6s, which makes their bid potentially false. Therefore, I will challenge the current bid.
