Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I must start the bidding. In my hand, I have two 6s, two 3s, and one of each of 1, 8, 4, and 9. To make a reasonable opening bid, I should choose a digit I have multiple of, like 6 or 3, and start with a low quantity to leave room for future bids. I will bid 2 6s because it reflects my hand and is a safe opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand and no 6s. The current bid is 2 6s, which I cannot support. Therefore, I should increase the bid using the 7 I have. I can bid 3 7s, which is a valid higher bid than the current one.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 7s. This means there would need to be at least two more 7s in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. While it's possible, it's not guaranteed. Instead of challenging, I can make a higher bid based on my hand. I have three 6s, so I can confidently bid 4 6s, increasing both the quantity and switching to a digit I have more of.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, which makes it plausible that there could be more than 4 6s in total, especially considering the previous bids. However, I can increase the bid to 5 7s, which is a higher quantity and a higher digit than the current bid. This seems to be a strategic move based on my hand.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 5 7s, which means there must be at least five 7s across both hands. Given that I only have one 7, it is unlikely that Player 1 has four or more 7s in their hand. The probability of there being five or more 7s seems low, so I should challenge the bid.
