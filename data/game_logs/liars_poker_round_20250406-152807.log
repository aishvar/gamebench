Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 9s, one 4, one 7, one 8, and one 6. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 5s, as I hold two myself, and there are likely more in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have one 5 (from 40332316) in my hand, and since there are two players, the total count of 5s must be at least 1 (the one I have) and at most 8 (if the other player has 7). The current bid of 2 5s is within this possible range. However, I can increase the bid by either increasing the quantity or changing the digit to a higher one. I see that I have multiple 3s, so bidding 3 3s could be a reasonable move as it increases the quantity. However, a more strategic move would be to bid on a digit I have more of or a higher digit. I have a good number of 3s, so I can bid 3 3s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 5, 7, 4, 9, 8, 5, 9, 6. I have no 3s, making it unlikely that there are 3 or more 3s in total unless the opponent has at least 3 themselves, which is improbable. Since I have zero 3s, the likelihood the total is 3 or more is low, so challenging is the best move.
