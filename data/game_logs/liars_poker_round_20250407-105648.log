Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 9s, one 5, one 1, one 3, and one 8. A safe and reasonable opening bid is to claim there are at least 2 of a digit I hold multiple of. I'll start with '2 7s' as I have two 7s, making this bid very safe.
