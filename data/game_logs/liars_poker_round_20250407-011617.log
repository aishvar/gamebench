Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 3 3s is reasonable, as it's a moderate quantity and likely to be believable. This bid is based on my hand and considers the possibility that the opponent might have at least one 3.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have zero 3s in my hand (06491651). For the bid to be true, the opponent must have all three 3s. While possible, challenging such a low bid early is risky. I have two 6s and two 1s. Bidding based on my hand is safer. A bid of 3 6s is higher than 3 3s (same quantity, higher digit). Since I hold two 6s, this bid only requires one 6 from the opponent's 8 digits, making it a plausible and relatively safe bid that leverages my hand's strength without significantly increasing the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 6s. Considering the uncertainty of Player 1's hand, challenging is a reasonable move as the total number of 6s might be less than three.
