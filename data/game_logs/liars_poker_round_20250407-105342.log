Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without worrying about being too high. I see I have two 6s and two 8s. A bid of 2 8s seems reasonable as a starting point, given that I have two 8s and it's a low quantity with a moderate digit.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s. Bidding 4 8s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. Given my hand (52490618), I have one 8. The total count of 8s could be higher, but I don't have enough information about Player 1's hand. However, I can see that bidding a higher quantity or digit could be strategic. Since I have one 8, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 6s and other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. The current bid is 4 8s, so I need to bid higher than this. I can bid 5 8s or change the digit. Given that I have two 6s, I could bid 5 6s, but I should consider if challenging could be more beneficial or if my hand supports a higher bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Given the bid history, it's reasonable to assume Player 0 may have made this bid based on their hand. To make a valid higher bid, I should increase both the quantity and the digit. I have two 3s and one 8, but no 9s. However, bidding on a different digit is not an option as I don't have any other digits available in my hand. I will increase the quantity to 6 and keep the digit the same, 8, to make a valid higher bid.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. Given that I have one 8 in my hand and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I need to assess if bidding higher is reasonable or if challenging is more likely to succeed. My hand contains one 8, so I know there are at least 2 8s in total (including Player 1's hand). If I bid 7 8s or higher, it must be a valid higher bid. However, I should also consider the possibility of challenging if I think the bid is unlikely to be true.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 8S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Given the bid history and the relatively low maximum possible quantity for any digit, I should challenge the current bid. It seems unlikely that the total count of 8s is 7 or more, considering the bid history and the limited number of digits available.
