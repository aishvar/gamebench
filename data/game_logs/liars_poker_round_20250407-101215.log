Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 0s, two 1s, one 4, one 2, one 8, and one 9. The most frequent digits in my hand are 0s, 1s, and 7s, each appearing twice. A safe opening bid would be 2 of one of these digits. I'll choose 2 7s as my opening bid because I hold two 7s myself, making this bid credible and forcing the opponent to either raise or challenge.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 74908217, I have two 7s and one 8. The current bid is 2 8s, which is plausible since I alone have one 8 and it's likely the opponent has at least one. Raising to 3 8s is reasonable based on the expectation that across 16 digits, three 8s is likely. Alternatively, the next minimal higher bid would be 2 9s, but since I have only one 9, 3 8s is a safer incremental raise.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 74908217, I have one 9. The current bid is 3 9s, which would require at least two 9s in the opponent's hand to be valid. Since it's unlikely the opponent has two or more 9s out of 8 digits, the bid seems risky. Therefore, challenging is a strong move here.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 1's (Naive 50/50) bid of 3 9s.
