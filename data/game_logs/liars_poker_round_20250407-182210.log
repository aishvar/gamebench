Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, the digit '5' appears twice, which is the highest count for any digit in my hand. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will bid that there are at least 2 fives across both hands. This is a safe opening because I already hold 2 fives myself, and it's plausible that the opponent has additional fives.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (60524340), I see I have one '5'. The current bid is '2 5s' made by Player 0. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one '5', bidding a higher quantity than 2 is not possible for me with the digit '5'. I should bid a higher digit or challenge if I think '2 5s' is unlikely. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and I have 8 digits, I can try to bid a higher digit if I have multiple instances of it. In my hand, I have two '0's, two '4's, and one of each of the other digits. The highest digit I can bid that is higher than '5' and exists in my hand is '6' or higher if I have it. I have one '6'. I can bid '1 6s' as it's a higher digit than '5'.

Player 1 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (60524340), I see I have one '5'. The current bid is '2 5s'. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one '5', bidding higher on '5' is not possible without risking a challenge. However, I can try to bid on a different digit. I have one '6', and there are 2 players, so the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. I will bid on a higher digit than '5', specifically '6', and claim I have at least 3 of them, which seems unlikely but could work if Player 0 doesn't have many '6's.

Player 1 bids: 3 6s

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 5, 8, 2, 7, 4, 1, 5, 1. There are no 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, meaning Player 1 claims there are at least three 6s across both hands. Since I have zero 6s, all three must be in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. The probability that Player 1 holds three or more 6s in their 8 digits is relatively low (less than 10%). Given this unlikely scenario and the fact that I cannot confidently bid higher without any 6s myself, the optimal move is to challenge the bid.
