Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 8s. I will bid 3 8s to start.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 8s

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have the hand 90195262, which contains one 8 and one 9. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I see one 8 in my hand, there are at least two 8s in total. I can bid 3 9s as it is a higher bid than 3 8s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I don't have any 9s in my hand. Since I don't have any 9s, it's unlikely there are a lot of 9s. I can bid 4 0s, which is a slightly safer bid than challenging immediately, as it increases the quantity and changes the digit. This gives me more information in the next round if the opponent calls or raises.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 90195262, which contains one 0. So, the total count of 0s across both hands is at least 1. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since the maximum quantity is 16 and there are 8 digits per player, the maximum count for any digit is 16. The current quantity is 4, so I can increase it. I will bid 5 0s, increasing the quantity.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 6 0s is a safe increase and a valid bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have the digits 90195262, which means I have one 0. The total count of 0s across both hands must be at least 1 (mine) and at most 9 (if the other player has 8). Since the current bid is 6 0s, it's plausible that there are 6 or more 0s in total. However, I can bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. I can see that I have a relatively low number of 0s, so bidding more 0s might be risky. I will increase the digit instead. Bidding 6 1s is a reasonable next step as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 6 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. I could challenge, but it's not an extremely high bid. I could also bid higher. I will bid 7 2s. This is a safe increase.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 2S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 7 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 2s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand is 90195262, which contains the digits 9, 0, 1, 9, 5, 2, 6, 2. I have two 2s, so I know there are at least two 2s in our combined hands. The bid is for 7 2s, so the other player must have at least 5 2s. It's possible but I should be cautious. I can bid 7 3s, keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit. My hand has no 3s, so it's a relatively safe bid as it relies entirely on the other player's hand. However, I should also consider the likelihood of the other player having many 3s. Given the aggressive bidding history, I'll take a slightly more conservative approach and bid 8 2s, increasing the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. The bid history shows several bids on 0s and 1s. Bidding slightly higher on 2s seems reasonable. I'll bid 9 2s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 2s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand is 90195262, which contains one 2. The total count of 2s across both hands is at least two (one from my hand and at least one from the opponent's hand). Bidding 9 3s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit. However, I should also consider the quantity and the fact that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. Since 9 is not an extremely high quantity, and given the history of the game where both players have been escalating bids, I will try to make a bid that is higher but still reasonable. Increasing the digit to 3 is a good option.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 9 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. Bidding higher than 9 3s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. I could bid 10 0s, 10 1s or 10 2s but the bid history indicates that these digits have been bid up to 6, 6, 9 respectively. Bidding 10 3s seems reasonable. It is a small increase and I have one 3 in my hand.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 10 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 3s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand is 90195262, which contains one 3. The total count of 3s across both hands must be at least one (mine) and at most 16. The current bid of 10 3s suggests that there are at least 10 3s in total. Given that I have one 3, there are at least 9 3s in the other player's hand, which is highly unlikely but possible. However, increasing the quantity to 11 3s or bidding 10 4s or higher is a reasonable move. I will bid 10 4s as it is a higher bid than 10 3s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 10 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. Bidding higher than 10 4s is required. I could bid 11 4s, or 10 of a higher number. Given the history, bidding 11 4s seems like the safest option, as it only increases the quantity by 1.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 11 4S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 11 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 11 4s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. My hand is 90195262, which contains the digits 9, 0, 1, 9, 5, 2, 6, 2. I count 2 occurrences of the digit 4, which is more than expected since the average would be 1.6 (8/10). The total count of 4s across both hands is 11, so it's possible but unlikely that the other player has more than one 4. However, bidding 12 4s or 11 5s seems reasonable as it slightly increases the quantity or changes the digit. Given that I have two 4s, I can confidently bid 12 4s.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 12 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 12 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. It's possible there are 12 or more 4s in total, but it's also possible that the previous player is bluffing. Given that the bid is already at 12, the chances of it being true are decreasing. I could bid 13 4s, or a higher digit, but challenging seems more reasonable. There are only 16 total digits in play, and 12 of them being 4s is a high proportion.
