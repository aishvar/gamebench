Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 8 digits in my hand: 84047923. Looking at the frequency, I have one 0, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 7, one 8, and one 9. Since this is the first bid and I want to start conservatively, I'll bid based on a digit I actually have in my hand. A bid of '2 4s' is reasonable - I have one 4, and there's a decent chance the opponent has at least one 4 as well, making this a safe opening bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current game state. The current bid is '2 4s', meaning Player 0 claims there are at least 2 fours in both our hands combined. Looking at my hand (27316159), I don't have any 4s. This means if Player 0's bid is honest, they must have at least 2 fours in their hand. Since this is the first bid and relatively conservative (only claiming 2 of a digit), it's likely to be true. I should make a higher bid based on what I know about my own hand. I have two 1s in my hand, so I could confidently bid '3 1s', hoping Player 0 has at least one more 1. Alternatively, I could bid on 5s (I have one) or 9s (I have one). Since I need to make a higher bid than '2 4s', I could bid either '3 1s' (higher quantity), '2 5s' (same quantity, higher digit), or something else based on my hand. I'll go with '3 1s' since I already have two 1s in my hand, making it a safer bet.

Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 84047923, I have zero 1s. The opponent bid '3 1s', claiming there are at least 3 ones total. Since I have none, all 3 would need to be in their hand. While possible, I could make a safer bid of '3 2s' since I have one 2 in my hand, or '3 3s'. However, given the low quantity and that I have zero 1s, challenging seems optimal as it's unlikely they have 3 or more 1s in their 8 digits.
