Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Analyzing my hand 97005339, the digit counts are: 0 (2), 3 (2), 5 (1), 7 (1), 9 (2). Opening with a bid on a digit I have multiple copies of gives a safer start. I have two zeros and two nines, but zeros tend to be more common statistically. Therefore, an opening bid of 2 zeros is reasonable and conservative.

Player 1 response was not valid JSON: 'To determine the best move, I analyzed my hand and the current bid. My hand contains two 2s, so bidding 2 2s is a safe and valid higher bid. 

```json

  "reasoning": "I have two 2s in my hand, making it a safe bid. The current bid of 2 0s can be exceeded by bidding 2 of a higher digit, which 2 is. This bid is likely valid as I know I have two 2s, and Player 0 may have more.",

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 response was not valid JSON: 'To determine the best move, I analyzed my hand and the current bid. My hand lacks zeros, so the bid of 2 zeros must come from Player 0. Considering the possibility of bluffing, I have two 2s, allowing me to safely bid higher on a different digit.

```json
{
  "reasoning": "I have no zeros, so Player 0 must have at least 2 zeros. I have two 2s, allowing me to bid on a higher digit without risking a challenge.",
  "action": "BID: 2 2s"

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 3/3
Player 1 response was not valid JSON: 'The current bid is 2 0s, and I have none. I can bid on a higher digit I have multiple of.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Current Bid:** Player 0 bid 2 0s.
2. **My Hand:** 25621769 → digits are 2,5,6,2,1,7,6,9.
3. **My 0s:** I have zero 0s.
4. **Possible Total 0s:** Since I have none, Player 0 must have exactly 2 to make the bid correct.
5. **Challenging Risk:** Challenging would claim total <2, but if Player 0 has exactly 2, I lose.
6. **Alternative Strategy:** Bid on a higher digit with quantity ≥2.
7. **My Digits:** I have two 2s and two 6s.
8. **Choose Higher Digit:** Bidding on 6s is safer as 6 > 0.
9. **Bid:** 2 6s, a valid higher bid.

```json
{
  "reasoning": "I have no 0s, so Player 0 must have exactly 2. Challenging risks losing if the bid is correct. Instead, I'll bid on a higher digit I have multiple of, which is 6. Bidding 2 6s is valid and safer.",
  "action": "BID: 2 6"
}'
