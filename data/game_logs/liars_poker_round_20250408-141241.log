Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible. To outbid, I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 9s, a strong move is to bid 2 9s, which is a minimal but valid raise and supported by my hand. This puts pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.
