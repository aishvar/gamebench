Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As this is the first bid of the game, I want to start with a conservative but reasonable opening. My hand contains two 1s, two 2s, two 4s, one 3, and one 9. Since I have two 2s and two 4s, bidding 3 2s or 3 4s is a safe and credible opening bid, accounting for the likelihood that my opponent has at least one more of that digit. I will choose 3 4s as it is a solid, non-aggressive opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. Bidding 4 4s would be risky as it relies entirely on my opponent having at least one 4. I have one 9, so bidding 4 9s is a possibility, increasing both the quantity and the digit. Alternatively, I could bid 3 5s, increasing the digit but keeping the quantity the same. Given I have no 4s, and the opponent could have several, I'll try to leverage my 9 and bid higher. Bidding 4 9s seems reasonable.

Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 4 9s, which would require there to be at least three 9s in the opponent's hand to be valid. Given that the average count for any digit is roughly 1.6 per hand (since 16 digits divided over 10 digits), four 9s total is a high but plausible bid, but unlikely unless the opponent has an unusually high number of 9s. Since I only have one 9, and four total is improbable, challenging is the best move.
