Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains two 7s, and I can start with a conservative bid to gauge the game. I will bid 2 7s as my starting bid, increasing the quantity and digit based on my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s, and it is plausible that Player 0 has at least one 7 as well, making the bid reasonable. To stay in the game and increase the bid, I will raise it to 3 7s, as it is a safe and logical progression based on the information I have.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 7s, and I have a total of 8 digits. I can see that bidding a higher quantity or digit could be advantageous. Since I have two 7s, I can confidently bid higher than 3 7s. I will increase the quantity to 4 and keep the digit as 7, or try to increase the digit. However, I don't have any other 7s or higher digits in significant quantity to make a strong claim. I will increase the quantity to 4 and keep the digit as 7, or go for a slightly higher digit. I have one 8 in my hand, so I could try 4 8s for a higher bid.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand, which makes the current bid of 4 8s plausible, but only if Player 0 has at least one 8. Since I can't challenge this bid outright, I must make a higher bid. Given my hand, a bid of 5 8s is reasonable because it increases the quantity while staying on a digit I have multiple of, making it likely to hold up.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more likely to succeed. My hand contains the digits 7, 8, 1, 5, 9, 0, 1. I have no 8s but I do have a 9 and other digits. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 8 digits in my hand, I should consider if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is more prudent. Given that I have no 8s, bidding higher on 8s seems risky. However, I can try to bid on a digit I have. The current bid is 5 8s, so I need to bid higher than 5 or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. I have one 9 which could potentially be part of a higher bid. A bid of 6 9s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. In my hand, I have one 9. Considering there are 16 digits total across both players, this bid implies that the other player would need to have at least 5 9s. This seems unlikely based on probability and the distribution of digits in my hand. Therefore, I believe challenging this bid is the best move.
