--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, one 8, one 0, two 4s, and two 2s. A conservative but reasonable opening bid would be 2 of one of these digits. I'll choose 2 4s, as I hold two 4s myself, making the bid safe and forcing the opponent to either challenge or raise beyond that.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 4s in my hand, so the total number of 4s depends entirely on Player 0's hand. The current bid is 2 4s, which is a low bid. Given that I have zero 4s, challenging is a reasonable option to test the validity of the bid without making a risky higher bid.
