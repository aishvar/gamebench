Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first turn, and there are no bids yet. I have two 4s, two 6s, and one of each other digit in my hand. A reasonable opening bid would be 2 6s, as I already have two 6s, and it's a safe and modest starting point to gauge the opponent's response.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 83957714, I have no 6s. The current bid is 2 6s. Since I have zero 6s, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least 2 6s. While this is possible, it's not guaranteed, and I can reasonably doubt it. However, since the bid is quite conservative and early in the game, challenging now might be premature. Instead, I can safely raise the bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving to 2 7s, as I have two 7s in my hand, making that bid plausible.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 7s. This means there need to be at least one more 7 in Player 1's hand for their bid to be valid. Since this is plausible but not guaranteed, I will make a higher bid to maintain pressure. I also have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 3 6s is a reasonable and valid step up from the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 3, 9, 5, 7, 7, 1, 4. I do not have any 6s, so all three 6s in the current bid would have to come from Player 0's hand. Since it's unlikely Player 0 has all three 6s alone, the current bid of 3 6s appears risky. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
