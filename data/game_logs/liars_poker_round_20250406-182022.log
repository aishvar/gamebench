Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, so the total count of 0s is at least 1. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 2 0s seems reasonable as it is a minimal increase and still a relatively low bid. However, I also have a 6 in my hand, so bidding 1 6s would also be a valid higher bid by increasing the digit. Given that I have a 6, bidding 1 6s is a more aggressive and potentially safer move as it increases the digit, making it harder for the other player to challenge without knowing my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 7s. I have one 7 and no 0s in my hand (41863960). The total count of 7s across both players must be at least 1 (the bid quantity), and since I have one 7, it's possible the other player also has a 7 or more. However, given that the quantity is low (1), and I have some information about my hand, I can try to bid higher. The next higher bid can be either a higher quantity with the same digit or a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I don't have any digit higher than 7 in abundance, and I'm not confident about the count of 7s in the other player's hand, I'll increase the digit. Thus, bidding 1 8s is a reasonable move as it is a valid higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s. I have one 9 and no 8s or 7s in my hand (41863960). The bid history shows a gradual increase in the digit. Given that I have one 9, it's possible that the total count of 9s is more than 1. I also have one 6, which is higher than the previous bids in terms of digit. A reasonable next step is to increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 2 9s is a safe increase in quantity. However, considering my hand and the fact that the opponent is a Naive 50/50, I might also consider bidding on a digit I have, to potentially make a more informed (or less risky) bid. Nonetheless, sticking to the current digit and increasing the quantity seems more straightforward and less risky than switching to a different digit.
