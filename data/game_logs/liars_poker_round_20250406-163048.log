Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 8s, two 1s, one 2, one 4, and one 6. A conservative and reasonable opening bid would be 2 of one of the digits I have multiple of. I'll choose 2 8s as my opening bid, reflecting my hand's strength and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable next step, as it increases the quantity of the current bid's digit. This bid is likely to be safe, as there are 16 digits in total and it's plausible that another 8 exists in the opponent's hand.

Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, which means the opponent claims there are at least three 8s in total. Since I already hold two, it only requires the opponent to have at least one 8 for the bid to be valid, which is quite plausible. Therefore, challenging now is risky. A safe and strategic move is to increase the bid slightly. I will bid 3 9s, which is a strictly higher bid by digit but keeps the quantity the same, maintaining pressure without overcommitting.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have two 6s in my hand, which suggests that there might be at least 4 6s in total. Bidding 4 6s increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid, making it a reasonable move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (28468010), I have two 6s. The current bid is 4 6s, so for that to be valid, there must be at least two more 6s in Player 1's hand. Given that four 6s total is plausible but not certain, a higher bid would be risky. However, challenging now is premature because four 6s is reasonable. To increase strategically, I can bid 4 7s, which is a minimal raise satisfying the rules and keeps pressure on the opponent.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have two 6s in my hand, which suggests that there could be more 6s in the opponent's hand. Bidding 5 6s increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a valid and strategic move. Additionally, I have one 8 in my hand, making a bid of 5 8s also a possibility, but 5 6s seems more likely to be true given my hand and the bidding history.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 28468010, I have two 6s. The current bid is 5 6s, which means there must be at least 3 additional 6s in Player 1's hand to make the bid valid. Given the average distribution, expecting 5 or more of any digit across 16 total digits is already on the high side, and since I hold two 6s, it's unlikely Player 1 has three or more additional 6s. Therefore, challenging is a strong move here.
