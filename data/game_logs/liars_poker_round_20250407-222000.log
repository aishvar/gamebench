Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 23936028, I have one 2, one 3, two 0s, one 6, one 8, and one 9. Starting with a conservative bid makes sense since it's the first move. I have two 0s in my hand, so bidding '3 0s' is reasonable - it only requires my opponent to have one more 0 to be true, which is fairly likely.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, making it unlikely that there are 3 or more 0s total between both players. Since the current bid is 3 0s and I hold zero, it would require my opponent to have all 3 or more zeros, which is improbable. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
