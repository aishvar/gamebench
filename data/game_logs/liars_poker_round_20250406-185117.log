Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. The current bid is 2 0s, so for that to be true, the opponent must have at least one 0, which is plausible. Since it's still early and 2 is a low bid, challenging now is risky. To increase the bid, I can either bid 2 1s or any digit higher than 0, or go to 3 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s. Bidding 3 5s leverages my strong holding and is a reasonable next bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 5s. Given that I don't have any 5s, the opponent would need at least three 5s for the bid to be valid. Considering the uncertainty and the possibility of bluffing, challenging the bid is a reasonable move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
