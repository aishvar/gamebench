Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have examined my hand: 84575626. I see that there are no 0s in my hand. Given that there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand, a bid of 1 0s is plausible because it is possible the opponent has at least one 0. However, I can make a higher bid based on my hand. I notice I have two 6s. I can bid on a higher digit or increase the quantity. Bidding 2 0s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. My hand is 84575626, which contains no 1s. The total count of 1s across both hands must be at least 2 (the bid quantity), but since I have no 1s, Player 0 must have at least 2 1s. Given that I have a reasonable distribution of other digits, I should bid higher. I see I have two 5s and one 6. A reasonable next bid could be to increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 3 1s seems plausible because it's a small increase in quantity, but I can also consider bidding with a higher digit. Bidding 2 2s is a valid higher bid as it increases the digit.
