Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 8, one 4, one 3, one 5, one 9, one 5, one 1, and one 7. The most frequent digit in my hand is 5, appearing twice. A conservative but reasonable opening bid would be 2 5s, reflecting my two 5s and the likelihood the opponent has at least one more. This sets a baseline without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have the digits 6, 0, 1, 7, 1, 7, 2, 0. I can see that I have no 5s, which means the total count of 5s across both hands is at least 2 (since the current bid is 2 5s and it must be referring to the count in both hands). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 3 5s seems plausible because it's a small increment. Alternatively, bidding 2 6s is also a valid higher bid since 6 is greater than 5. Given that I have a 6, I can reasonably bid 2 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 8, 4, 3, 5, 9, 5, 1, 7, which contain zero 6s. The current bid is 2 6s, meaning there must be at least two 6s across both hands. Since I have none, the entire bid relies on the opponent having at least two 6s. That is plausible but somewhat unlikely. However, since the bid is still relatively low and within reasonable probability, challenging now carries risk. A safer approach is to increase the bid slightly, preferably in a digit I have more of. I have two 5s, so bidding 3 5s is a reasonable incremental raise based on my hand's strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 60171720, which contains one 6. The current bid is 3 5s. I can make a higher bid by either increasing the quantity or bidding on a higher digit. Since I have one 6, I can confidently bid on 6s. Bidding 3 6s is a valid move as it is higher than 3 5s due to the higher digit. This seems like a reasonable action given my hand and the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (84359517), I have zero 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, which requires at least three 6s across both hands. Since I have none, all three would have to be in the opponent's hand of 8 digits, which is somewhat unlikely but possible. The probability of the opponent having 3 or more 6s is low enough to make a challenge reasonable. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.
