--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, two 8s, and one each of 0, 2, 6, 7, and 9. The most promising digits to start with are 5s or 8s, given I hold two of each. Opening with a conservative but solid bid, I will choose 3 5s, expecting that at least one more 5 exists in the opponent's hand, making this a likely safe opening bid.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 5s. Bidding 4 5s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have a good chance of winning.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 5s. Since the current bid is 4 5s, this implies there need to be at least two more 5s in the opponent's hand for the bid to be valid. Given that each player has 8 digits, it's somewhat unlikely the opponent holds two or more 5s, but not impossible. However, since I already hold two, and the probability of the opponent having two or more 5s is low, challenging here is a strong move.
