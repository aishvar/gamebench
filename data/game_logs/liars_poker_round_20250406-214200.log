Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Since it's the first bid, I can choose any quantity and digit. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable, as there's a decent chance the opponent has at least one 6, making the total count 3 or more.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. To make a reasonable bid, I should consider digits I *do* have. I have two 9s. Bidding 4 9s is a plausible option. Alternatively, I could bid 3 7s, as I have one 7. Since I have two 9s, and the current bid is relatively low, I will bid 4 9s. This increases the quantity and the digit.

Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, and I have zero 9s in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and considering both players have 8 digits each, it's unlikely that Player 1 has four 9s. Challenging this bid seems reasonable as it's a high quantity for a single digit.
