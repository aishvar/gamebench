Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open with an initial bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, two 8s, one 5, one 0, one 3, and one 6. The most common digits are 4 and 8, each appearing twice. Opening with a conservative yet reasonable bid of 3 4s leverages my own two 4s and assumes the opponent might have at least one 4, making it likely the total is three or more.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I don't have any 4s in my hand. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I will increase the quantity to 4 and keep the digit at 4. This is a valid bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 4. The current bid is 4 4s, meaning there should be at least four 4s across both hands. Since I only have one, that would require my opponent to have at least three 4s, which is quite unlikely given the distribution across 16 digits. The probability of one player holding three or more of the same digit is low. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best strategic move.
