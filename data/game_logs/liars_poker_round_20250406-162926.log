Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand 24395871, I have one of each digit except 0 and 6. A common opening bid is 2 of a common digit. I have one 8 and one 9, so I could bid 2 8s or 2 9s, which are reasonable starting bids. Choosing 2 8s as 8s tend to be common and it aligns with my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have no 8s in my hand, making it unlikely that there are 2 8s in total. Challenging this bid seems like the best move.
