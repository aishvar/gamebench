Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand, which is the digit I have the most of. Starting conservatively, bidding 2 4s seems reasonable as it is highly likely there are additional 4s in the opponent's hand, making this a safe initial bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than this. I have a 2 in my hand, which could contribute to a bid of a higher digit. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and I do not have enough information about Player 0's hand, I should make a conservative bid that is higher than 2 4s. Bidding 3 5s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have exactly one '5' in my hand. The opponent bid '3 5s', meaning they likely have at least a couple of '5's. Given that there are 16 digits total and I hold just one '5', it's plausible the opponent has at least two. However, since I already have three '4's in my hand (digits: 34457402), I can confidently increase the bid to '4 4s', as I alone have three and it's very likely the opponent has at least one '4'. This is a safer bid than challenging at this stage.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains one 4, so I have some information to base my bid on. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I see that I have a 5 in my hand, and bidding on a higher digit seems reasonable if I can justify the quantity. The current bid quantity is 4, and I have one 4 in my hand, making 4 4s possible but not certain. I will increase the quantity slightly and bid on a digit that I have in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 34457402, which contains exactly one '5'. The opponent bid '5 5s', meaning they claim there are at least five '5's between both hands. I have only one '5', so the opponent would need to have at least four '5's in their eight-digit hand, which seems statistically unlikely. Given this, challenging the bid is the most logical action.
