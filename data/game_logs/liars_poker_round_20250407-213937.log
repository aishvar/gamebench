--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I have to make the opening bid. Looking at my hand '60511864', I count the digits as follows: 0(1), 1(2), 2(0), 3(0), 4(1), 5(1), 6(2), 7(0), 8(1), 9(0). The most frequent digits in my hand are '1' and '6', both appearing twice. Opening bids are typically conservative, so I will bid on '1's since they are common overall. A reasonable opening bid is '2 1', indicating at least two '1's total, which I know I have. This forces the opponent to either raise or challenge, but they cannot successfully challenge since I already hold that many.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand, which allows me to confidently bid 2 4s. This bid is higher than the current 2 1s and leverages my known digits to make a valid and strategic move.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. In my hand, I have one '4' (the last digit). Since I only see one '4', for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least one '4' as well. This is plausible, so challenging now is risky. To maintain a safe strategy, it's better to increase the bid modestly. The next valid bid would be either 2 5s or 3 of any digit. Since I have two '1's, bidding 3 1s is relatively safe, as I already hold two myself, so the opponent might plausibly have one more. This is a safer incremental bid compared to guessing about 4s or higher digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I do not have any 1s in my hand, so the total number of 1s is entirely in Player 0's hand. Since Player 0 has bid 3 1s, I must determine if this is likely. Given that I have no 1s, if Player 0 has exactly 3, their bid is valid. However, considering the game dynamics and possible bluffing, I choose to challenge the bid, hoping Player 0 does not have 3 1s.
