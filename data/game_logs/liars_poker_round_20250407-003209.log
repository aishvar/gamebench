Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so any valid bid is acceptable. I have one 9 in my hand. A conservative bid of 1 9s is a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, making the current bid of 1 9s highly unlikely. Since the maximum possible 9s in play is 2 (one from each player), bidding 2 9s is a safe and valid increase. However, challenging might be more strategic if I suspect the opponent is bluffing.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I know there's at least one 9 in play. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have two 5s, so bidding 3 5s is also possible. However, sticking with 9s seems slightly better as the opponent already bid on it, implying they might have some. Therefore, increasing the quantity of 9s is the most logical move.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 9s. Since I cannot increase the quantity or digit based on my hand, and the bid seems unlikely given the lack of 9s in my hand, challenging is the best option.
