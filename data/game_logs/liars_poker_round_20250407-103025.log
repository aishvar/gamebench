Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0, which already meets the current bid of 1 0s without considering Player 0's hand. Since the bid is quite low and very likely true, challenging now would be unwise. The natural move is to increase the bid slightly. I will raise the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving from 1 0s to 1 1s, which is the minimal valid higher bid.
