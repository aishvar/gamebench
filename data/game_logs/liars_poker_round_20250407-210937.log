Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player, I can choose any digit and quantity. I have two '2's in my hand, so I'll bid on '2's with a quantity of 3, expecting the opponent to have at least one '2'.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 twos. Looking at my hand (70954789), I have zero 2s. Since I have none, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have all 3 or more 2s, which is unlikely given the random distribution of digits across 8 cards. With zero 2s on my side, the probability that the opponent has 3 or more 2s is low. Therefore, challenging is the optimal strategy.
