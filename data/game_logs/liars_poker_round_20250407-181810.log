Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, the digit '9' appears three times, which is the highest frequency of any digit I hold. Opening with a conservative but strong bid based on my hand alone, I will bid 3 nines. This is a solid starting bid, as I already have 3, and it's likely there are additional nines in the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand, so I cannot make a higher bid with the digit 9. I need to decide whether to challenge the bid or make a bid with a different digit. Since I have three 3s, I can bid 4 3s, which is a valid higher bid. Challenging the bid is risky because the opponent might have the 9s to support their bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. Looking at my hand (99491056), I have no 3s at all. This means all 4 (or more) 3s would have to be in Player 1's hand, which is highly improbable given they only have 8 digits. The average count of any digit in 16 digits is about 1.6, so 4 is already above average, and with me holding none, this bid is quite risky. Therefore, the most strategic move is to challenge the bid rather than raise it.
