Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand, ensuring the total count of 2s is at least three. Bidding 3 2s is safe because the bid will hold unless the opponent has negative 2s, which is impossible. This bid sets a low threshold for the opponent to challenge, as the minimum count is already met. Any challenge would fail, forcing the opponent to raise or lose.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. Since my hand is 64538941, I have a total of 4 even digits (6, 4, and two other even digits are not present but 8 and others are). I can see there's a possibility of having higher digits and quantities. I will bid 4 6s as I have two 6s and it seems like a reasonable and valid higher bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand has 0 6s, so the opponent must have at least 4 6s. With only 8 digits in their hand, having 4+ 6s is statistically unlikely (probability ~0.004% for exactly 4, lower for higher counts). Challenging is favorable.
