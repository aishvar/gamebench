Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. The digit '0' appears once in my hand. Assuming the opponent has a similar distribution, a bid of '0' with a quantity of 2 is reasonable. This bid is low enough to be safe but starts the bidding process.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 3/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. The digit '1' appears once in my hand. Assuming the opponent has a similar distribution, bidding '1' for the digit '1' is a safe start. This bid is likely to be true, and it sets a baseline for future bidding.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 count of digit 1 across both hands. Looking at my hand (64397882), I have zero 1s. Since the total number of digits is 16, it's likely the opponent has at least one 1, making the current bid plausible. To maintain pressure and keep the game going, I can safely increase the bid to 1 of a higher digit I possess multiple times. I have two 8s, so bidding 1 8s is a minimal safe raise that fits the rules.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is '1 8s'. Since I have no 8s in my hand, I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a new bid. Given that the maximum possible quantity of any digit is 16, and the opponent has bid '1 8s', it is unlikely that there is only one 8 across both hands. Therefore, challenging the bid seems like a reasonable move.
