Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, which is a relatively high digit. Since I don't have any information about the other player's hand, I'll make a conservative bid that is likely to be true but also gives me a good starting point. Bidding on the 6s seems like a good choice because it's a high digit and I already have two of them, making it more likely that the total count across both hands could meet or exceed my bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding 3 6s is a valid option, but it doesn't significantly increase the risk for the opponent. Bidding 2 7s is also valid. Given my hand, and the opponent's initial bid, challenging seems reasonable as it's unlikely they have another 6. It's a calculated risk, but potentially rewarding.
