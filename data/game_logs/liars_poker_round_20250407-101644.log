Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. Since I hold two 5s, two 6s, and two 8s, I have strong counts on those digits. A safe and strategic move would be to raise the bid in quantity and digit to reflect my hand strength. I will bid 2 5s, which is a straightforward increase over the opening minimal bid.

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 2 6s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which already accounts for the current bid of 2 6s. Since it's likely there are additional 6s in Player 0's hand, a slightly higher bid is reasonable. To increase conservatively, I will bid 3 6s, raising the quantity by one while keeping the digit the same.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 7s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (56586849), I have the digits: 5,6,5,8,6,8,4,9. Counting 7s, I have zero. The current bid is 3 7s, which requires at least three 7s across both hands. Since I have none, Player 0 must have all three or more, which is unlikely given the distribution. The naive player may have overbid. Given typical digit distribution and no 7s on my side, it's improbable there are 3 or more 7s total, so challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (Naive 50/50) bid of 3 7s.
