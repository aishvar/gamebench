Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and it's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 63461713. I have two 6s, two 1s, and two 3s. The total number of digits in play is 16 (2 players * 8 digits). An average digit count would be 1.6. Having two 6s is above average. A reasonable opening bid is based on the digits I hold. Bidding '3 6s' requires the opponent to have at least one 6 among their 8 digits, which is statistically plausible (approximately a 57% chance assuming random distribution). This is a slightly aggressive but reasonable opening bid based on my hand, using the highest digit I have duplicates of.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 6s in my hand. The opponent's bid of 3 6s requires them to have all three 6s in their 8-card hand. Given the low probability of holding three of a specific digit in 8 cards and the common bluffing nature of the game, challenging is statistically favorable here.
