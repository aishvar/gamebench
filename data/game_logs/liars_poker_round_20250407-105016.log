Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 76085144, which contains no 0s. Since the current bid is only 1 zero, it is quite plausible that Player 0 has at least one 0 in their hand, or that there is at least one zero across both hands. Challenging now is risky. Instead, I can safely increase the bid. I notice I have three 4s, so bidding 3 4s is a reasonable and safe higher bid that leverages my hand strength.
