Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a unique distribution of digits in my hand. The current bid is None, so I can make any bid. I notice I have a high count of 8s (two) and a moderate count of 6s (one). I should make a bid that is likely to be higher than None, but not too high to be immediately challenged.
