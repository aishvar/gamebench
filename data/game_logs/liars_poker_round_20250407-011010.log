Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 7, one 9, and one 7 again. The digit I have the most of is '7', with two occurrences. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid, I will start with 2 7s, reflecting my hand and leaving room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 2 9s increases the digit from 7 to 9 while keeping the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This avoids raising the quantity and uses my existing 9s to make the bid credible.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 2 9s, which is plausible since I have one and the opponent could reasonably have one as well. To make a valid higher bid, I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. In my hand, I have two 7s. Since the initial bid was 2 7s, and the opponent raised to 2 9s, I can now raise the quantity to 3 for 7s, leveraging the fact that I hold two 7s myself, making it quite plausible there are at least three 7s total.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s is valid as it maintains the quantity but uses a higher digit (9 > 7). This assumes the opponent has at least one 9, making the total count 3. It avoids challenging the 3 7s bid since the opponent could plausibly have three 7s.

Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 27309157, I have exactly one 9. The current bid is 3 9s, so for that to be true, my opponent must have at least two 9s. This is somewhat plausible but not guaranteed. Raising to 4 9s would be risky without more 9s in my hand. Alternatively, I could bid 3 of a higher digit, but the highest digit is 9, so that's not possible. I could also raise the quantity to 4 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, so bidding 4 7s seems more reasonable, as it only requires my opponent to have two 7s, which is more plausible than assuming they have at least two 9s. Therefore, I will increase the quantity and switch to 7s.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand has zero 7s, so the opponent must have at least four 7s for the bid to hold. Given the low probability of an opponent having four or more 7s in their 8-digit hand, challenging is statistically favorable.
