--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. In my hand, I have the digits 1, 8, 6, 4, 4, 0, 6, 3. Counting the digits, I have two 4s and two 6s, which are my highest counts. To start conservatively and based on my hand strength, I will bid 2 4s, as this reflects my hand and leaves room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 2 7s is valid since I already have two, making the total count at least two. This bid is higher than the current 2 4s due to the higher digit (7 > 4), and it's safe because my hand guarantees the minimum required count.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand '18644063', I have zero 7s, which makes the current bid of 2 7s dependent entirely on the opponent's hand. Since the total digits are 16 and the bid is only 2, it is quite plausible that there are at least 2 sevens overall. Challenging now would be risky. Looking at my hand, I have three 4s. The current bid is 2 7s, so a valid higher bid would be 2 8s or 3 of any digit. Since I hold three 4s, a safe and strategic move is to bid '3 4s', which is likely valid and forces the opponent into a tougher position.

--- Turn: Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. Since I have no 4s, the opponent must have at least three 4s. Given the low probability of them having three 4s in their 8-digit hand, challenging is statistically favorable.
