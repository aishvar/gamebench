Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Analyzing my hand (6 4 2 7 4 5 7 5), the counts are: 0s=0, 1s=0, 2s=1, 3s=0, 4s=2, 5s=2, 6s=1, 7s=2, 8s=0, 9s=0. A safe opening bid is usually 2 of a digit I hold multiple of, to avoid overcommitting early. I have two 4s, two 5s, and two 7s. I'll open with 2 of 4s, as it's conservative and supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have the digits 6,8,8,7,3,1,8,9 in my hand. There are no 4s in my hand, so the total count of 4s is at most 8 (since the other player could have up to 8). However, the current bid is '2 4s', which is relatively low. Given that there are no 4s in my hand, it's possible that the other player has at least two 4s, making the bid plausible. Since the bid is low and plausible, it's better to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I can bid on a digit that I have in my hand to increase my chances. The digit '8' appears three times in my hand, so bidding '3 8s' is a safe and strategic move.

Player 1 bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 eights. Looking at my hand (64274575), I have zero 8s. For Player 1's bid to be valid, all three 8s must be in their hand, which is somewhat unlikely given 8 digits. The probability of exactly 3 eights in an 8-digit string is relatively low (~6-7%). Since I have none, and the bid is already at 3, this seems like a good opportunity to challenge. Bidding higher on eights without any in my hand would be risky, and raising with a different digit requires at least 4 of another digit across both hands, which is uncertain. Therefore, challenging is the strategically sound move.
