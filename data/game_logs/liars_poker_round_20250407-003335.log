Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I can bid anything. I have one 8 in my hand. A conservative bid of 1 8s seems reasonable to start with. It's not overly aggressive and establishes a baseline.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 1 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, matching the current bid of 1 8s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 8, increasing the quantity is not possible. Therefore, I will increase the digit to 9 and bid 1 9s.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 1 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. I also have one 8. Since the previous bid was 1 8s, and I have one 8, it's plausible the other player also has an 8. However, bidding 2 8s feels too risky given my limited knowledge. Instead, I will bid 2 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, and it's not unreasonable to think the other player could also have at least one 0. This is a conservative bid to maintain the game.

Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 2 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 0s. Since I know there are at least two 0s in total (my two 0s), I can safely bid higher. Increasing the quantity to 3 0s is a reasonable move, as it's possible the opponent has at least one 0, making the total at least three.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 0S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 4 0s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and it's plausible given my hand. A challenge seems risky as there have already been bids involving 0s, suggesting at least some exist. Increasing the bid seems like the best option at this point.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 4 0s, which means there must be at least three more 0s in the other player's hand. Given the bid history and the fact that the other player has been increasing the bid on 0s, it's possible they have multiple 0s. However, without more information, challenging seems risky. Instead, I can try to bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have many 0s, I'll increase the digit to 1 and bid 4 1s, which is a valid higher bid based on the rules.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 1s is necessary. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 1s is possible, but risky. Increasing the digit to 4 2s seems more reasonable, as I have a 2 in my hand. This avoids a potentially high quantity bid that might be difficult to support. My hand doesn't offer any other strong options for a higher bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 2S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. In my hand, I have two 2s. Considering the bid history and my hand, I can reasonably assume there might be at least 5 2s in total, including both players' hands. Therefore, I can make a higher bid of 5 2s, increasing the quantity while keeping the same digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 2S'
Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 5 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. Bidding higher than 5 2s is necessary. I could bid 6 2s, but that feels risky given I only have one 2. I could bid on a different digit. I have a 6 in my hand, so bidding 1 6s would be a valid, but weak, bid. However, I also have a 4. Bidding 5 3s would be a reasonable increase, as it maintains the quantity and increases the digit. Bidding 6 2s is too aggressive. I'll go with 5 3s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 3S'
Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) bids: 5 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 3s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total, it's unlikely there are 5 or more 3s in play. I should challenge the bid.
