Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 48151624, I have zero 9s. Since there are 8 digits in my opponent's hand and none in mine, the bid of 3 9s would require the opponent to hold at least 3 of them. The probability of that is quite low given typical digit distribution. Therefore, challenging this bid is the best strategic move.
