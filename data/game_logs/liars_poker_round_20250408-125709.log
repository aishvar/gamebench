Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid and it's my turn, I need to make the first bid. My hand is 39004162. I count the digits: there's one 3, one 9, three 0s, two 4s, one 1, one 6, and one 2. I have a good number of 0s, so bidding on 0s seems reasonable. I'll start with the count of 0s I have, which is 3. A bid of 3 0s seems like a safe and reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 53946688, which contains no 0s. The current bid is 3 0s, meaning the opponent claims there are at least three 0s among the total 16 digits. Since I have zero 0s, the opponent would need to have at least three 0s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, it's somewhat risky. However, since the bid is still relatively low, challenging might be premature. Instead, I can safely raise the bid to a digit I have multiple of. I have two 6s and two 8s, making a bid of 3 6s or 3 8s plausible. I'll bid 3 6s since I have two already, needing only one more from the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I see that my hand contains a 9 and there was an initial bid of 3 0s, it's possible that there are several high digits. I will increase the quantity to make a new bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 6s. The current bid is 4 6s, meaning there must be at least two additional 6s in my opponent's hand. Given that there are 16 digits total and each player has 8 digits, it's plausible my opponent has at least two 6s, making the bid of 4 6s reasonable. However, raising the bid to 5 6s would require my opponent to have at least three 6s, which becomes less likely. Alternatively, I can safely bid on another digit where I have strong representation. I have two 8s, so bidding 4 8s is equally plausible and safer, as I currently hold two myself and would only need two more from my opponent. Thus, bidding 4 8s seems like a safer and strategically sound move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I need to make a bid that is higher than this. I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand is 39004162, which contains one 8. I have a total of 8 digits, and there are 8 digits in the other player's hand, making 16 digits in total. Given that the current bid is 4 8s, and I have one 8, it's possible that the total count of 8s is indeed 4 or more because the other player must have at least 3 8s. However, I can bid on a higher digit. I will increase the digit from 8 to 9. So, my bid will be 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. My hand is 53946688, and I have exactly one 9. Therefore, the opponent would need at least three 9s in their eight-digit hand to meet the current bid. Given the limited information and the relatively high bid, it's plausible but somewhat risky. However, I have two 6s and two 8s, making a bid of 5 6s or 5 8s potentially risky as well. Considering the uncertainty and the increasing risk, challenging seems to be the safer and more strategic move.
