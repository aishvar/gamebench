Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 8, 5, 2, 0, 6, 9, 1. This includes one 0, matching the current bid of 1 0s. Since the total number of digits is 16, it's very likely that there is at least one other 0 in the opponent's hand, making the current bid quite safe. Therefore, rather than challenging, I should make a higher bid. I notice I have two 8s, so bidding 2 8s is a safe and natural next bid that strictly increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.
