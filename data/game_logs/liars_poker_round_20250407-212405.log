Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make an opening bid. I want to choose a digit and quantity that is somewhat likely but not too aggressive. I have two 2's in my hand. Bidding one '2' is too weak. Bidding two '2's is reasonable as a starting point. Bidding Quarters is another option, but I'll go with 2 twos.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 '2's. Looking at my hand (92448371), I have zero '2's. Since I have none, for the bid to be true, all '2's must be in Player 0's hand. While it's possible Player 0 has one or more '2's, a bid of 1 is very safe and likely true. Challenging now would be premature. The minimum valid raise is either increasing the quantity (to 2 2s), or bidding 1 of a higher digit (e.g., 1 3s). Since I have two '4's, bidding 2 4s is a strong move because I personally hold two, making it very probable. This puts pressure on Player 0 to challenge or raise with less certainty.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I need to either bid higher or challenge. I don't have any 4s in my hand. The maximum possible number of 4s is 16. It's plausible that there are two 4s between the two hands. I will bid higher to stay in the game. I have two 2s. I will bid 3 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. To bid, I must increase either the quantity or the digit. I have two 2s in my hand. I can bid 3 2s, which is a valid increase in quantity. I could also bid something like 2 5s, since I have a 5, but bidding with the 2s is slightly less risky. I will bid 3 2s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 twos. In my hand (9,2,4,4,8,3,7,1), I have exactly one '2'. For the total to be at least 3 twos, the opponent must have at least 2 twos in their 8 digits. Having 2 or more of a specific digit in 8 digits is plausible, but not guaranteed. Since the opponent initially bid 1 two, then raised to 3 twos after my 2 fours, it suggests they might be bluffing or overbidding. Given that I only have one '2', and that 3 twos is a borderline bid, challenging is reasonable here.
