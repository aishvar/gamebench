Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. I can bid slightly higher to try and gain information or bluff. I will bid 2 1s, which is a small increase and doesn't commit me to a large number of any digit.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I don't have any 4s in my hand. I could bid 3 5s, but a safer bet would be to increase the quantity to 4 and bid 0s since I don't know how many 0s are out there, and the bid history shows someone bid 1 0 previously. Given the naive player is bidding, they might be bluffing. I will bid 4 0s.
