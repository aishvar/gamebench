Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s and two 4s in my hand. Since there are no bids yet, I should start with a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 2 6s is a safe starting point, as I know there are at least two 6s in the game.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (79392859), I do not have any 6s. The current bid is 2 6s. Since I have zero 6s, for the bid to be true, the other 3 players would need to have at least 2 6s collectively. This is quite plausible given 24 unknown digits, so challenging now would be risky. The minimal safe move is to make a slightly higher bid. Since the current bid is 2 6s, the next valid bids can be 2 7s, 2 8s, 2 9s, or 3 of any digit. I have two 9s in my hand, making a bid of 2 9s very safe. Therefore, I will bid 2 9s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 9s

--- Turn: Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains a 6, a 9, and other digits. Since I have one 9, I can confidently bid higher than 2 9s. I will bid 3 9s to increase the quantity while also considering the higher digit option, but there's no higher digit than 9. I also notice that bidding 3 or more 9s seems reasonable given that there are 4 players and 8 digits each, making 32 digits in total. Thus, increasing the quantity seems like a safer bet.

Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (68521934), so the total count of 9s must be at least 1 (mine) plus the 3 that Player 2 bid, making it at least 4. However, I don't have information about other players' hands. Given that the quantity is already 3, and I have one 9, it's possible that there are more 9s. Bidding 4 9s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same. It's a conservative move that still allows for the possibility that other players have more 9s.

Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand (from 72264684). The current bid is 4 9s, which is already high considering there are only 32 digits in total and 4 players. With only one 9 in my hand, it's unlikely that the other players collectively have three more 9s. Therefore, challenging the bid seems like the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) challenges Player 3's (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bid of 4 9s.
