--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 6s, one 5, one 1, one 7, and one 5. The most frequent digits are 3 and 6, each appearing twice. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand would be 2 6s, as I already hold two myself. This is a safe initial bid that puts slight pressure on the opponent.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand, which provides a strong foundation to make a higher bid. The current bid is 2 6s, and since I hold no 6s, the total number of 6s depends solely on Player 0's hand. Bidding 3 9s is a strategic move as it increases both the quantity and the digit, leveraging my hand's strength.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s and no 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, meaning my opponent is claiming there are at least three 9s across both hands. Since I have zero 9s, that would require my opponent to have all three or more 9s, which is quite unlikely given the total of eight digits per player. The probability that one player has three or more 9s is low, so challenging is the best strategic move.
