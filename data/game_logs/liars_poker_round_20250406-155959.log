Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game. I need to analyze my hand and make a strategic opening bid. My hand is 25229058, which contains: one 0, one 5, one 8, two 2s, two 9s, and one 5. Since I have two 2s and two 9s, these are my strongest digits. However, I don't want to reveal too much information with my first bid. A conservative opening bid would be to claim 3 of a digit I have at least 1 of. I'll bid 3 2s since I already have 2 in my hand, so I only need 1 more from my opponent's hand, which is reasonably likely.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 2s at all, making the current bid of 3 2s dependent entirely on the opponent holding at least 3 of them in their 8 digits, which is unlikely. The maximum total 2s possible is 8, but since I have zero, the probability they have 3 or more is relatively low. Therefore, challenging this bid is a strong move.
