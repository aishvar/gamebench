Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 0s, two 4s, and one each of 1, 2, 9, 3. Bidding 2 0s seems safe and reasonable as it's a digit I have multiple of, and it's a valid starting bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s and two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 2 0s. Bidding 3 5s increases the digit and quantity slightly, making it a reasonable bid based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 5S'
Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s and no 5s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s, which seems reasonable given the lack of 5s in my hand. However, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity and choosing a digit I have more of. Bidding 4 0s is a safe and reasonable move, as it increases both quantity and is based on the digits in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 0s. Bidding 5 6s seems reasonable, as it increases both the quantity and the digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 5 6s, which seems plausible but might be a stretch. Given the bid history and my hand, I can either challenge or bid higher. Since I only have one 6, bidding 6 6s would be risky. However, I can bid 5 7s, increasing the digit while maintaining the same quantity, as I have two 7s in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have two 7s in my hand, which makes this bid plausible. However, I do not have any 8s, and it's unlikely that my opponent has three 8s. Bidding 6 7s seems reasonable, as it increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same, and it's a plausible bid given my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 7S'
Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 6 7s, which is already high. Given the bid history and my hand, I cannot confidently increase the quantity or digit. The next logical bid would be 7 7s, but without more 7s in my hand, this seems risky. Challenging is a safer option as the current bid might be overstated.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) challenges Player 1's (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bid of 6 7s.
