Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without risking a challenge. I see I have two 7s and two 9s. A bid of '2 7s' seems reasonable as a starting point, given that I have two 7s and there's no current bid to compare against.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s, and I have two 6s and one 7 in my hand. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 3, 1, 0, 7, 9, 4, 9, 6. I have two 7s and two 9s, and other digits appear once or not at all. A reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 7s, I can try to increase the quantity or bid a higher digit. The bid 4 7s seems reasonable as I have two 7s and it increases the quantity.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s, which means there are at least 4 7s in total. I can bid 5 7s, increasing the quantity to a higher number, which seems reasonable based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I need to make a higher bid. I have two 6s and two 7s in my hand. The bid must be higher in quantity or digit. I can see that bidding a higher quantity with the same or lower digit won't work since I only have two 7s. However, I can try to bid a higher digit with a similar or higher quantity. The current bid is 5 7s, so I should consider bidding at least 6 of any digit or 6 7s. Since I have two 6s, I can try to bid 6 6s or 6 7s or higher. But I should also consider if I can challenge, given the high bid of 5 7s seems unlikely given 16 total digits and 8 in my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 6 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Based on the bid history, Player 0 has consistently bid on the digit 7, with increasing quantities. The current bid is 6 6s, which seems unlikely given the previous bids. I have a 6 in my hand, but I should challenge the current bid to potentially win.
