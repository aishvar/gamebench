Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s and two 0s, making these digits favorable for an opening bid. A typical conservative opening is '2' of a digit I hold multiple times. I'll choose 2 8s, as 8s tend to be psychologically impactful and I hold two myself, making the bid credible.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 45827808, I have two 8s and zero 9s. The current bid is 2 9s. Since I hold no 9s, the opponent would need to have both 9s for the bid to be valid, which is unlikely. Given the total of 16 digits, the probability of exactly two 9s with me holding zero is low. It's a reasonable spot to challenge rather than increase the bid on a digit I have none of.
