Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, one 1, one 4, one 5, one 6, and one 9. Opening with a conservative bid based on my own hand, a common approach is to bid two of a digit I possess multiples of. I have two 0s, so starting with '2 0s' is safe and reasonable.
