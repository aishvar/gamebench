--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make a reasonable assumption about the total count of a specific digit. I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding 3 8s is a logical choice, assuming the opponent has at least one 8. This bid is likely to be valid and sets a higher bar for subsequent bids.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have three 3s in my hand. Bidding 4 3s is a valid higher bid because it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This seems like a reasonable and strategic move given my hand and the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have no 3s in my hand, so the total count depends on Player 1's hand. Challenging is a good move because it's unlikely Player 1 has four 3s.
