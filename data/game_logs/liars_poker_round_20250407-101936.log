Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, so the current bid of 1 0s is plausible but minimal. I do have two 7s and two 9s, which suggests a safe way to increase the bid is to switch to digits I hold multiple copies of. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can bid 1 1s, 1 2s, ..., 1 9s (higher digit, same quantity), or increase quantity to 2 of any digit. Bidding 2 7s leverages my two 7s, which is likely valid considering the opponent's 8 digits. Therefore, I will increase the quantity to 2 and choose 7s.
