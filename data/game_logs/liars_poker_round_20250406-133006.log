Requesting action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid in the game. Looking at my hand (15782836), I have the following digits: one 1, one 5, one 7, one 8, two 3s, one 2, and one 6. Since I have two 3s in my hand, that's my most frequent digit. A reasonable opening bid would be to claim there are at least 3 3s in total between both players' hands. This is conservative enough to be likely true (I already have 2 of them, and there's a decent chance the opponent has at least one more), but not so low that it's trivial for my opponent to outbid me.
