Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid in the game. Looking at my hand (31720014), I have: one 0, two 1s, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 7, and no 5s, 6s, 8s, or 9s. Since I have two 1s in my hand, that's a good starting point. The other player likely has some 1s as well, so bidding 3 1s is reasonable. It's a conservative opening bid that has a good chance of being true based on my hand alone, and leaves room for the bidding to develop.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s, two 6s, one 5, one 3, and one each of 1 and another 5. Since I hold one '1', and the opponent bid 3 1s, it's plausible they have two 1s. However, I also have strong counts in 6s and 8s (two each). Rather than challenging now, a safer strategy is to increase the bid to a digit I have good coverage in. I will raise to 3 6s, which is a valid strictly higher bid (same quantity, higher digit), backed by my two 6s and possible one or more from opponent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze what I know about the game state. In my hand (31720014), I have one 1, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 7, and two 0s. Notably, I have zero 6s. The current bid is '3 6s', meaning Player 1 is claiming there are at least 3 sixes between our hands. Since I have zero 6s in my hand, all 3 (or more) would need to be in Player 1's hand. While this is possible, it seems somewhat unlikely that they would have 3 or more of the same digit in an 8-digit hand. The probability of having exactly 3 of a specific digit in 8 random digits is about 5.5%. I could challenge, but if they do have 3 sixes, I'll lose. Alternatively, I could raise the bid. Since I have two 0s in my hand, bidding '4 0s' would mean there need to be at least 2 more 0s in their hand, which is also possible but not highly likely. I think challenging is slightly better here since the opponent would need to have exactly 3 or more 6s for me to lose the challenge.
