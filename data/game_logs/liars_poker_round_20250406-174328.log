Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I don't have any 1s in my hand. I could challenge, but a naive player made the bid, so it's possible they have the 1s. I'll make a slightly higher bid to see what happens. I will bid 3 2s, as I have one 2 in my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. I could bid 4 3s, but I'll play it safe and bid 4 4s, increasing both the quantity and the digit. This is a slightly more conservative approach.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, which is a safe increment. However, since the opponent is a naive 50/50 player, they might be bluffing. Given the bid history and the fact that I only have one 5, I will bid a slightly higher quantity on a different digit to test the waters. I'll bid 5 0s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. Bidding higher seems like the safer option considering the opponent is a Naive 50/50 player. I can bid 6 2s, increasing both quantity and digit, and it's less risky than challenging.

Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
