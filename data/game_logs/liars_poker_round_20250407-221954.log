Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning I can make any initial bid I want. I have 8 digits in my hand: 6, 7, 9, 2, 0, 7, 4, 3. The digit 7 appears twice, which is the highest count I can confidently bid on without revealing my hand. Since no bids have been made yet, I can start with a conservative bid to test the waters. I will bid 2 7s as it's a valid and low-risk starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, the digits are 6, 0, 3, 5, 2, 8, 9, 5. I have zero 7s. The current bid is 2 7s, meaning there must be at least two 7s combined across both hands. Since I have none, all 7s would have to be in Player 0's hand, which is somewhat unlikely but plausible. Because 2 is a low quantity and challenging here carries some risk, it is safer to increase the bid slightly. I will raise to 2 8s, which is a minimal increase since I have one 8 in my hand, making the bid plausible.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have a 7 in my hand, and the previous bid was 2 7s. I should increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 8s or higher digits to confidently bid, I will increase the quantity slightly and bid on a digit I have. I have one 7, so bidding 3 7s seems reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (60352895), I have one 7 and one 8. The current bid is 3 7s. Since I only see one 7, for the bid to be valid, the opponent would need at least two 7s. This is plausible but not highly likely. Alternatively, I can raise the bid to 3 8s because I have one 8, so the opponent would need at least two 8s, which is similarly plausible. To avoid challenging too early and to keep pressure, I'll raise to 3 8s, which is a strictly higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains one 8. Given that the bid is 3 8s, I should consider if I can make a reasonable bid that is higher. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I can increase either the quantity or the digit. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and there are only 8 digits in each player's hand, making 16 in total. I have one 8, so bidding higher on 8s or switching to a higher digit could be strategic. Bidding 4 8s seems risky without knowing the distribution of 8s in Player 1's hand. I can see if I can make a bid on a higher digit that I have in my hand.

Player 0 bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9. For the current bid of 3 9s to be valid, there must be at least two more 9s in Player 0's hand. Given that each player has 8 digits, it's somewhat unlikely Player 0 has two 9s, since that would mean 3 out of 16 digits are 9s, and I only have one. The probability of Player 0 having two or more 9s is relatively low. Therefore, challenging this bid is a reasonable move.
