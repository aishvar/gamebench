Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: With no current bid and 16 digits in play, I want to open safely by leveraging my hand. I hold two 9s, which guarantees that there are at least 2 9s in total. By bidding '2 9s', I make a bid that is backed by my hand, forcing my opponent to either raise the bid or risk a challenge.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. My hand is 24853714, which contains no 9s. Given that there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's, the total count of 9s can't be more than 8. The bid of 2 9s is quite conservative and plausible. I should bid higher. I can see I have one 4 and one 5 and other digits are either lower or not repeated. A reasonable next bid could be to increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 3 4s or 2 5s would be valid. I choose to bid 2 5s as it increases the digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have the digits 24853714, and I can see that I have no 9s. The bid of 2 9s implies that the other player has at least two 9s. Given that the total count of 9s across both hands is at least 2, I can make a higher bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I can bid 3 0s or higher, or 2 [digit]s where [digit] is greater than 9 (not possible since 9 is the highest digit). My hand contains one 2, one 4, one 5, one 3, one 7, and two 1s, and no 9s or 8s. Bidding 2 8s or 2 7s isn't a good idea because it doesn't increase the quantity, and I don't have enough information about the other player's hand. However, I can bid 3 0s or 3 1s as both are valid higher bids. I see that I have two 1s and one 2 and other lower digits, so bidding 3 1s seems plausible as it increases the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 1s in my hand (my hand is 0, 7, 6, 6, 9, 4, 9, 8), which means any 1s must come from my opponentâ€™s 8 unknown digits. Statistically, the chance of there being 3 or more 1s among those 8 cards is extremely low. Therefore, the current bid of 3 1s is very unlikely to be true and I should challenge.
