--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 3s, which is a reasonable starting point. Bidding 2 3s is a safe and valid initial bid.

Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 12591418, I have zero 3s. Since the total digits are 16, and I see none, that leaves all 3s potentially in the opponent's hand. The current bid is 2 3s, which is quite plausible as the opponent may have two or more 3s. Challenging now is risky because two 3s in their hand is reasonable. To make a safe higher bid, I should pick a digit I have multiple of. I have two 1s, two 1s in my hand plus potentially one or more in theirs makes a bid of 3 1s quite reasonable and safely higher than 2 3s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 1S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 1s. Since I know there are at least two 3s in play (from my hand), I can safely increase the bid to 4 3s, which is higher than the current bid in both quantity and digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 3S'
Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 12591418, I have two 1s, zero 3s, and two 1s is consistent with my previous bid of 3 1s. The current bid is 4 3s. Since I have zero 3s, for Player 0's bid to be valid, they would need at least 4 3s in their own hand, which is unlikely given 8 digits per player. The expected average count of any digit per player is less than 2, so 4 total 3s is plausible but somewhat risky. Without any 3s myself, I consider it unlikely there are 4 in total. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
