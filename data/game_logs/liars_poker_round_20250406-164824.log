Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have an 8 in my hand, but I need to make a higher bid than None. Since there are 8 players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16*8=128, but I'll start with a conservative estimate. I'll bid on a digit that I know exists in my hand, which is 8. I'll start with a quantity of 1.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 1 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8, which already satisfies the current bid of 1 8s. Since it's early in the game and the bid is low, it's risky to challenge now. A reasonable next move is to increase the bid slightly. I also have two 3s, so bidding 2 3s is a safe and valid higher bid that increases the quantity, putting pressure back on my opponent without overcommitting.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have a 3 in my hand, but I also have a 7, which is higher than 3. Considering the bid history and my hand, bidding 1 7s is a safe choice, as it's higher in digit than the current bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s, which seems conservative. I have a 3 in my hand, so bidding 3 3s is a reasonable move, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 3S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '16851339', I have two 3s. The current bid is 3 3s, which requires at least one more 3 in Player 0's hand to be valid. Given that each player has 8 digits, it's plausible Player 0 has at least one 3, making the bid reasonable. Rather than challenge a plausible bid, I will raise. Since I also have two 1s, bidding 3 9s (I have two 9s) or 3 8s (one 8) has similar uncertainty, but increasing the quantity is safer. I will bid 4 3s, increasing the quantity on the same digit, which is a valid next bid and supported by my two 3s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have two 3s and one 8 in my hand. Bidding 5 3s seems like a reasonable move, increasing the quantity of the digit 3, which is already the focus of the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 3S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '16851339', I have two 3s. Given there are 16 digits in total, the current bid is 5 3s, which would require at least three 3s in the opponent's hand. Having three or more 3s in eight digits is somewhat unlikely, though not impossible. Since I hold two 3s, and the bid requires five, it's a risky assumption that the opponent has three or more. Therefore, challenging now is a strong option.
