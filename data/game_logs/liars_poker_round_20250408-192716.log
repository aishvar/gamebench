Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, so I know for sure that there are at least 2 9s in play. Starting with a bid of '2 9s' is safe because even if the opponent has no 9s, the total count will equal my bid and I win if challenged. Also, bidding with the highest digit in a given quantity forces any opponent who wishes to bid on the same quantity to increase the quantity, putting pressure on them.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9, so challenging has a 43% chance of success (if opponent has no 9s). However, bidding 3 5s (I have two 5s) offers a 57% chance of validity (opponent likely has at least one 5). This higher probability bid keeps the game going with better odds than challenging.

--- Turn: Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, so the entire count of 5s must come from my opponent's 8 digits. Statistically, the chance that they have three or more 5s is extremely low (roughly 3-4% if digits are uniformly distributed), making the current bid very unlikely. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
