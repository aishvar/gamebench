Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a low bid based on my hand. I have two 6s, so I can confidently bid at least 2 6s.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s, so there is already a reasonable chance the bid is valid. To raise, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 1s, bidding 2 7s or 2 8s is riskier, but bidding 3 1s leverages my hand better. Given I hold two 1s, it's plausible there is at least one more 1 in the opponent's hand, making 3 1s a reasonable, safe higher bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I don't have any 1s in my hand. I can raise the bid to 3 2s, which is a valid increase. Or I could bid higher based on the 6s I have. I have two 6s. The previous bid was 2 6s. I think it's safer to bid 3 2s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 2S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 60112973, I have two 1s and one 2. The current bid is 3 2s, which requires there to be at least three 2s across both hands. Since I only have one 2, Player 0 would need to have at least two 2s to make this bid valid. This is possible but somewhat unlikely. Alternatively, I can consider making a higher bid. Because I have two 1s, bidding 3 3s or 3 4s is riskier, but bidding 4 1s is plausible, since I have two 1s and suspect Player 0 might have at least two more 1s or one plus some chance. Statistically, there are about 1.6 of each digit per player, so four 1s is reasonable. Therefore, I will raise to 4 1s rather than challenge.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. I can bid 4 of a higher digit, or a higher quantity of any digit. I have two 6s, so bidding 4 6s is a valid and safe move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 6. The current bid is 4 6s, meaning there must be at least four 6s across both hands. Since I only have one, Player 0 would need to have at least three 6s, which is statistically unlikely given 8 digits. The expected count of any digit across 16 digits is about 1.6, so 4 is quite high. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
