Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must initiate the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 7, one 4, one 7, one 6, zero 0s, one 1, one 3, and one 5. The most frequent digits in my hand are two 7s. Starting with a conservative yet reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 7s, reflecting my hand's strength and setting a baseline for the game.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (74760135), I have zero 8s. Since the current bid is 2 8s, that would require both 8s to be in Player 1's hand, which is possible but not highly probable. Given the total of 16 digits, but considering the low bid and the fact that Player 1 might have simply incremented the digit without strong evidence, it's risky to challenge now. Instead, I will make a minimal legal raise to maintain pressure and gather more information, by bidding 2 9s.
