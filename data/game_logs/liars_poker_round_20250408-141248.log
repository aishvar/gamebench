Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand (digits: 8, 0, 7, 2, 9, 1, 0, 6). Since the current bid is only 1 0s, I know there are at least three 0s in total. It is very likely the other player has at least one more 0, making a higher bid quite safe. Therefore, I will confidently increase the quantity to 3 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 8, 0, 7, 2, 9, 1, 0, 6. I count two 0s and one 1. The current bid is 3 1s, so for that to be valid, across both hands there must be at least three 1s. Since I only have one 1, Player 0 must have at least two 1s for the bid to be valid, which is somewhat unlikely. Alternatively, I can make a safe higher bid leveraging my two 0s, since the last bid on 0s was 3 0s, and the current bid of 3 1s resets the digit, so I can bid 3 2s or 4 0s to increase the quantity. Given my two 0s, bidding 4 0s is plausible, as it only requires Player 0 to have two 0s, which is reasonable. This is a safer strategic move than challenging now.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s and only one 1. The current bid is 4 1s, which means there need to be at least four 1s across both hands. Since I have only one 1, Player 0 would need to have at least three 1s for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution and typical digit frequencies, having three or more 1s in one hand is unlikely but not impossible. However, since Player 0 previously bid 3 1s and then increased to 4 1s, they might be bluffing or overestimating. The probability favors a challenge here, as four 1s total seems improbable based on my hand.
