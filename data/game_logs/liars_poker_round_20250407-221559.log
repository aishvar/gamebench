Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have one '7', two '0's, one '8', one '4', one '3', one '6', and one '2'. Starting with a bid of '2 0s' is reasonable as I have two '0's in my hand, and it's possible the opponent has at least one more '0'.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 0s, making it uncertain how many 0s Player 0 holds. Since the current bid is only 2 0s, this is quite plausible given 16 total digits. Challenging now would be risky. To make a higher bid, I observe that I have two 8s, so bidding 2 8s is equal in quantity but higher in digit, which is a valid raise.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, which means the opponent must have at least one 8 to make this bid valid. Since I only have one 8, the total count could be 2 if the opponent has one 8. However, bidding higher is risky because the next bid would need to be at least 3 8s, which is unlikely. Therefore, challenging the bid seems like the best option to avoid escalating the bid further.
