Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 8s, one 9, one 4, one 2, and one other digit. The most common digits in my hand are 1s and 8s with two each. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 1s or 2 8s. I'll choose 2 8s, as 8 is a high digit, which may make it harder for the opponent to immediately raise on the same quantity with a higher digit.

Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s and one 9. The current bid is 2 9s, which is plausible since I hold one 9 myself, making it likely there is at least one more 9 in the opponent's hand. Challenging now would be risky. To increase the bid, I could either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 8s, bidding 3 8s is a reasonable step up, as it's very likely there are at least three 8s total. This is a safe and strategic higher bid.
