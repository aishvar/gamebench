Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have the digits 8, 1, 5, 7, 9, 2, 0, and 3 in my hand. Since there are no previous bids, I can make the first bid. I will start with a bid of 1 0s, which is a reasonable starting point as I have a 0 in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I see one 0. Since the current bid is 1 0s, I know there is at least one 0, which is my own. It's quite likely that there is at least one more 0 in the opponent's hand, so bidding 2 0s is a safe incremental raise. Alternatively, I could bid 1 1s or higher digit at the same quantity, but increasing the quantity is typically better early on. Therefore, I will raise to 2 0s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 2 0s, which is equal to the total count of 0s I can confirm. Since I have only one 0, and the bid is already at 2, I cannot support a higher bid for 0s. However, I can increase the bid with a different digit. I have two 2s in my hand, so I can bid 3 2s, which is a valid higher bid than the current one.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 2S'
Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (20764296), I have one '2'. The current bid is 3 2s, so my opponent claims there are at least three 2s in total. Since I only have one, that implies they likely have at least two 2s, which is plausible. To raise, I can either bid 3 3s or increase the quantity to 4 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s and two 9s, so bidding 3 6s or 3 9s is safer. Since 3 6s is a higher bid than 3 2s, I will bid 3 6s based on my two 6s, hoping there is at least one more 6 in their hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s, three 2s, and one 5 but no 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which I find unlikely given that I cannot contribute to that digit. I should challenge the bid as it seems improbable that there are three 6s among both hands.
