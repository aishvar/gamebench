Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, and the current bid is 1 0s. This means there is at least one 0 in play, making the bid valid so far. To increase the bid, I can confidently move to 2 0s, as it's likely there is at least one more 0 between both hands given the distribution of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '1' in my hand, and the current bid is 2 1s. Given that there are 16 total digits in play and Player 0 is making naive bids, it is likely there are at least two 1s in total. To maintain control of the game and avoid prematurely challenging, I will bid 3 1s, increasing the quantity while keeping the same digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 2s.

Instead of challenging, I will increase the quantity to 4 2s, as it is a plausible bid based on my hand and the game's dynamics.
