Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid of the game and there is no prior bid, I need to initiate the bidding with a reasonable and safe opening bid. Looking at my hand, the digit '1' appears three times, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. Given that there are 16 digits total in play, starting with a conservative bid of 3 ones ('1's) is reasonable, as it's likely there are more '1's in the opponent's hand as well. This sets a solid foundation for the bidding without overcommitting early.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '3 1s'. I have the digits 9, 2, 4, 8, 8, 9, 6, 6 in my hand, which means I have no 1s at all. Therefore, it is impossible for me to have any 1s in my hand. Since my hand contains no 1s, I believe the bid of '3 1s' is unlikely to be true. I will challenge this bid.
