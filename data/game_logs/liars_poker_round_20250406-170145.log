Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. I have two 7s in my hand. A conservative bid would be 1 7s, but I can afford to be slightly more aggressive. I'll bid 2 7s. This is a reasonable starting bid given my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s and one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 4 7s would be a valid increase in quantity. However, I also have a 9, and bidding 3 9s is also a valid increase in digit. Since I only have two 7s, and the opponent previously bid 2 7s then upped it to 3, it's possible they have at least one 7 as well. Bidding 3 9s feels safer as I have no information about the opponent's 9s, and it's a higher digit. I'll bid 3 9s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, so I should increase the quantity. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I'll bid 4 9s, as it's the next highest quantity.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 9s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 9s seems risky given I only have one 9. Increasing the digit to 4 0s is a viable option as I have one 0. Alternatively, I could challenge, but 4 9s isn't an impossible bid, and I only have one 9. Bidding 4 0s seems like the most sensible option.

Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 5 9s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I'm hoping my opponent doesn't have many more 9s. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit, but 9s seems like the most logical choice given the recent bidding history. Bidding 4 of another digit would be a weak move, and bidding a higher quantity for a different digit could be risky if I don't have many of that digit.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 5 9s. To make a higher bid, I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have no 10s, 11s, or higher, I should increase the quantity to 6. This is a reasonable move based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 9S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 6 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Given the history of escalating 9s bids, it's likely the other player also has some 9s. Bidding higher on 9s feels risky. I have two 7s, and the initial bids were on 7s. Bidding 7 7s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and avoids further escalation on a digit where I only have one card. Itâ€™s also a safe bet as the previous bids on 7s were relatively low.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. I have three 7s in my hand. Given the bid history, it's likely that Player 0 has a strong hand with the digit 7. To make a valid higher bid, I should increase both quantity and digit. I have one 8 in my hand, so bidding 8 8s seems reasonable.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 8 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand. Given that there are only 16 total digits, an 8 8s bid is highly improbable. It's very likely the opponent is bluffing. Challenging is the optimal move here.
