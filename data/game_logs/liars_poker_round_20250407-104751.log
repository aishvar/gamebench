Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the opening bid, and my hand contains two 8s, two 9s, two 0s, one 1, and one 4. A safe and reasonable opening bid would be 2 of one of the digits I have multiples of. Bidding '2 8s' leverages my two 8s and sets a baseline without overcommitting.
