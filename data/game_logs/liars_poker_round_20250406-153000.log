Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (76086379), I see that I have two 7s and one 6. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative and based on the digits I have. Bidding 3 7s seems like a good starting point as it reflects a quantity slightly higher than what I have, increasing the likelihood that the total count is higher, and choosing a digit that I have seen in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 95402852, I have zero 7s. Since the total number of digits is 16, and I have none, the opponent would need to have all 3 (or more) 7s to make their bid valid. This is unlikely given the distribution of digits. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
