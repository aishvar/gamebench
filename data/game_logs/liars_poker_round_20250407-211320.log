Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (23072115), I have: two 1s, two 2s, one 0, one 3, one 5, and one 7. Since this is the first bid and I want to start conservatively, I'll bid on a digit I know exists in my hand. Two 1s is a good starting point since I can verify them in my hand, and there could reasonably be more in the opponent's hand. A bid of 'two 1s' (Q=2, D=1) is safe and gives room for the bidding to progress.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 ones. Looking at my hand (7 8 2 6 0 1 4 9), I have exactly one '1'. For the bid to be valid, there must be at least two '1's across both hands. Since I have one, the opponent must have at least one for the bid to be true. This is fairly plausible. To avoid an early challenge with decent odds, I should make a higher bid. I can increase the digit to '2' while keeping the quantity the same, bidding '2 2s', since I have one '2' in my hand, making it plausible there are two in total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I can see my own hand (23072115) contains only one 2. For the current bid of '2 2s' to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least one more 2 in their hand. This is certainly possible. However, I have a strong counter-move available: I can bid '2 3s'. I can see one 3 in my hand, and bidding 3s raises the digit without raising the quantity, making it harder for the opponent to counter. This is a safer play than challenging, as the current bid of '2 2s' is quite reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s, meaning at least two '3's across both hands. Looking at my hand (78260149), I have zero '3's. Since I hold none, the entire bid relies on Player 0 having at least two '3's in their hand of eight digits. While one '3' is plausible, two is less likely. Given the distribution, the expected average count for any digit across 16 digits is about 1.6, so two '3's in one hand is above average and somewhat risky. Therefore, challenging is the strategic move.
