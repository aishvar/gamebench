--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand. The opponent's bid of 3 8s requires them to have at least three 8s in their 8-digit hand. Given the low probability of holding three 8s in a random distribution, and my lack of 8s, challenging is statistically favorable. Bidding higher (e.g., 4 6s) would require the opponent to have at least one 6, which carries significant risk if they have none.
