Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 8, and one 1 again (two 1s total). A safe and standard opening bid is 2 1s, given I hold two of them, making it likely there are more or at least not risky to start with.

Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. The current bid is 2 1s. I can make a higher bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have sufficient 8s, I will bid 3 8s, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. Since the total digits are 16, and the current bid is 3 8s, it's plausible that the opponent has two 8s, making the bid reasonable. Challenging now risks losing if they indeed have two 8s. To increase the bid, I can either bid 3 9s or 4 0s (next higher quantity). Given my hand has one 1 and one 0, bidding 3 9s is safer since 9s are less likely to be numerous, but it's still risky. Alternatively, bidding 4 1s is reasonable because I have one 1, and 4 total 1s is plausible. Therefore, I will raise to 4 1s, increasing the quantity and choosing a digit I partially control.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, which makes it reasonable to believe that a total of at least 5 8s could exist across both hands. Since the current bid is 4 1s, I can increase the bid by either raising the quantity or changing the digit. I will bid 5 8s, as it is a higher digit and a higher quantity than the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 8S'
Player 1 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) bids: 5 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (10824516), I have one 8. The current bid is 5 8s, meaning there must be at least five 8s across both hands. Since I only have one, my opponent would need to have at least four 8s out of their eight digits, which is statistically unlikely. Given the improbability of the opponent holding four or more 8s, challenging is the best strategic move.
