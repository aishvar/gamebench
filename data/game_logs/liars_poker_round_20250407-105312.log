Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have three 5s, which is a strong digit to open with. Opening with '3 5s' is a solid, credible bid based on my hand, and it sets a reasonable baseline.

Calculating action for Player 1 (Naive 50/50)

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 1, 9, 2, 5, 9, 8, 5, 5. I have zero 6s, so the entire count of 6s depends on my opponent's hand. Since the current bid is 3 6s, that would require my opponent to have all three or more 6s, which is unlikely. Given that the maximum possible 6s is 8 in their hand, but the probability of them holding 3 or more is modest, and since I have no 6s myself, challenging now is a good strategic move.
