Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative opening bid. I have two 5s in my hand, so I will bid a slightly higher quantity than what I know exists.

Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 3 5s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 8s and two 9s, along with other digits. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Given that the current bid is 3 5s, I can increase the quantity or the digit. A reasonable bid would be to increase the digit first, as there's a higher chance of having a valid higher digit in my hand. I will bid 3 6s, as it's a straightforward increase in digit value.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 4 0s is a safe incremental increase to the bid, as I don't want to overcommit to the number 6.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 4 zeros in total. Given that I have two 0s and 8 digits in total across my hand, and assuming Player 0 has a reasonable distribution, I should consider the possibility of challenging or making a higher bid. However, since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I must consider the distribution of digits in my hand and the previous bids. My hand contains two 0s, and I know there are 16 digits in total. The bid of 4 0s seems plausible but I need to increase the quantity or digit to make a valid higher bid. I will increase the quantity because I have no information about Player 0's hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. It's possible my opponent is bluffing. However, I can make a slightly higher bid without risking too much. I will bid 6 1s. I have one 1 in my hand, so it's not a complete bluff.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 6 1S'
Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) bids: 6 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I need to assess the likelihood of there being 6 or more 1s in total. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 16 digits in total between both players, I must consider if I can reasonably make a higher bid or if challenging is the better option. My hand contains 29102988, which means I have two 1s. With a bid of 6 1s and only 16 digits in play, it's possible but I need to calculate the risk of being wrong.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 7 2S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 7 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. It's possible there are seven 2s in total, but it's also possible my opponent is bluffing. Since I don't have any 2s, I'm less inclined to bid higher. I will challenge the current bid.
