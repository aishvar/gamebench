Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, one 0, one 5, one 4, two 3s, and one 1. The digit 7 appears twice, which is relatively strong. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will bid 2 sevens, as I already hold two and it's likely there could be more in the opponent's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s, meaning Player 0 believes there are at least 2 sevens across both hands. In my hand, I have no 7s. This means Player 0 must have at least 2 or more 7s in their hand to make their bid plausible. Since the maximum count of any digit across both hands is 16, it is possible Player 0 has 2 or more 7s. However, without any 7s in my hand, I find it unlikely that Player 0 would confidently bid 2 7s unless they are bluffing. Given this uncertainty and the fact that challenging could expose their bluff, I choose to challenge the current bid.
