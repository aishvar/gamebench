--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. As the opening bid, I want to start with a plausible quantity based on my holdings. Since there are 16 total digits in play (8 per player), bidding three 6s requires the opponent to have at least one 6 to make the bid valid. This balances risk and aggression, leveraging my existing pair while keeping the bid realistic.

Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s (digits: 29059633). The current bid is 3 6s, so with my two 6s, only one more 6 in Player 0's hand would satisfy the bid. It's quite plausible Player 0 has at least one 6, making the current bid reasonable. To make a higher bid, I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving to 3 7s. However, I have zero 7s, so this is risky. Alternatively, I can bid 4 of a digit I hold multiple of. I have two 3s, so bidding 4 3s is plausible, assuming Player 0 has at least two 3s. Since this is a reasonable incremental bid supported by my hand, I will raise to 4 3s.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 3s in my hand, so Player 1 must have all 4 of their claimed 3s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player holding at least 4 of a specific digit in 8 random digits is extremely low (~0.5%). Given the low likelihood and the high risk of overcommitting with a new bid, challenging is statistically favorable.
