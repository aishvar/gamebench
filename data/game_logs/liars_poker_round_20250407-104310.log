Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 71016856, I have one 0, which aligns with the current bid of 1 0s. Since I know of at least one 0, it's plausible the total is at least 1, making a challenge unwise. The next minimal valid bid must be either 2 0s or 1 1s. I see two 1s in my hand, so bidding 2 1s is reasonable and safe, as I already hold both. This is a strictly higher bid than 1 0s and leverages my known digits.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 71016856, I have no 2s. Since the current bid is 2 2s, for the bid to be valid, Player 0 must be holding at least two 2s or one 2, or be bluffing. Given the naive strategy of Player 0 and the fact that there are only 16 digits total, the probability that there are at least two 2s without me having any is moderate but plausible. However, since raising to 2 3s is a minimal and safe increase, and I hold one 1 and two 6s, I can comfortably raise the digit at the same quantity to 2 3s, which is a strictly higher bid. This keeps pressure on Player 0 without overcommitting.
