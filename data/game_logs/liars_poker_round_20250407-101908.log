Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 5s, two 1s, one 4, and one other digit. Starting with a conservative yet reasonable opening bid, I'll choose 3 7s, as I hold two 7s myself, making it likely that at least one exists in the opponent's hand.

Calculating action for Player 1 (Naive 50/50)
Player 1 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 8s
Player 1 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, making it unlikely that there are 3 or more 8s in total across both hands. Since each hand has 8 digits, the total is 16 digits, and the probability of 3 or more 8s without any in my hand depends solely on my opponent having all 3 or more, which is improbable. Therefore, I should challenge the current bid.
