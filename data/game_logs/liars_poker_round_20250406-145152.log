Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand '07086354', I see I have two 0s, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, and one 8. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative and based on the digits I see. I have a total of 2 zeros, so bidding '2 0s' seems like a safe and reasonable starting point.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have no 0s in my hand, so I can't contribute to that bid. I have two 5s, one 6, one 8, one 2, one 4, and one 1. Bidding 3 1s is a reasonable increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 2 2s or 2 4s or 2 5s or 2 6s or 2 8s. However, increasing the quantity seems like a safer move given I have no information about other players' hands. Bidding 3 1s is a valid and reasonable next bid.

--- Turn: Player 2 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 3 4s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). The two 4s I have increase the likelihood of the total count reaching at least 3. This avoids challenging the current bid, which has a plausible total count of 3 if other players have at least one more 4.

--- Turn: Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 13507191, I have two 1s and one 0, but no 4s. The current bid is 3 4s. With four players and 32 digits total, it's plausible there are 3 or more 4s, but since I have zero 4s, it slightly reduces the likelihood. However, it's still quite reasonable someone else has 3 or more 4s. Instead of challenging now, I can safely increase the bid by quantity or digit. Given my two 1s, increasing to 3 5s or 3 6s is speculative, but increasing quantity for 1s to 4 1s seems reasonable due to my two 1s and the previous bid of 3 1s. So, I'll bid 4 1s.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. My hand is 07086354, which contains one 1. I need to either make a higher bid or challenge. Since there are 4 players and 8 digits each, the total number of digits is 32. A bid of 4 1s implies that at least 4 ones exist across all hands. I have one 1, so the remaining 3 players must have at least 3 ones. Bidding 4 2s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit. However, I should also consider challenging if I think the bid is too high. Given that 4 1s is not an extremely high bid considering there are 32 digits in total, I will choose to make a higher bid. I will bid 4 2s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. Bidding 5 2s would be a reasonable bluff, as it's a small increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have two 5s, so bidding 4 5s would be a valid bid, increasing the digit. Given the previous bids, 4 2s seems plausible, but I think I can increase the quantity. I'll go with 5 2s.

Requesting action from Player 2 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. Since I have no 2s, challenging might be risky. To stay in the game, I can raise the digit to a higher number (3) with the same quantity. I have one 3, making this bid plausible without relying on 2s.

--- Turn: Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 3 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand (13507191), I have two 1s, one 3, one 5, one 0, one 7, and one 9. The current bid is 5 3s. I only have one 3, so for the bid to be valid, the other players combined would need at least 4 more 3s out of their 24 digits. The expected average per digit is roughly 3.2 (32 digits /10 digits). Having 5 of a specific digit is plausible but a bit above average. Since I have only one 3, and given the bid history has been increasing steadily and reasonably, I think it's risky to challenge now. Instead, I will raise the bid conservatively by increasing the digit to 5 4s, as 4 is a common digit, and the quantity remains the same but the digit is higher, which is a valid next bid.

Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 6 is a possibility, but it seems high given that I only have one 4. Increasing the digit to 5 is a safer option. I can bid 5 5s. I have one 5 in my hand, so it's plausible that there are at least 5 5s across all hands.

--- Turn: Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 5 5s. I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding 6 5s is possible, but risky as it requires a lot of 5s across all players. Bidding a higher digit with a quantity of 5 is also an option. I have a 6, 8, and a 4 in my hand, so I could bid 5 6s, 5 8s, or 5 4s. Given the previous bids have been increasing in digit, and I have a 6, bidding 5 6s seems like a reasonable and relatively safe move. It's a slight increase in digit, and I contribute two 5s to the current bid, so it's plausible other players have more 5s.

Requesting action from Player 2 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. The remaining players have 24 digits. To reach 5, they need at least three more 6s. While possible, it's uncertain. Challenging could be a strategic risk to test the bid's validity.
