Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, there is a high probability that at least one more 0 exists in Player 0's hand, making a bid of 2 0s reasonable and safe at this stage.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand 89380711, I have two 1s. The current bid is 2 1s, which is already supported solely by my hand. Since bids must strictly increase, the next minimal valid bid would be 3 1s. Given that I have two 1s myself, it's plausible that at least one 1 exists in Player 0's hand, making a total of three 1s quite reasonable. Therefore, instead of challenging, I will raise to 3 1s.
