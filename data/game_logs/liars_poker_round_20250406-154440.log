Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s, and bidding 2 6s seems like a reasonable starting point.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 09045489, I have no 6s at all. The current bid is 2 6s, which is plausible since the opponent could have two or more 6s. Since 2 is a low quantity and I can't confidently challenge it, the best move is to make a minimal higher bid. I have two 4s, so bidding 2 7s or 2 8s is riskier. Instead, I will bid 3 4s, leveraging my two 4s and assuming the opponent might have at least one 4, making my bid reasonable.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains a 6, and I can see that bidding a higher quantity or digit could be advantageous. Since the bid is 3 4s, I should either increase the quantity or the digit. I have a 6 in my hand, and bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 0, 9, 0, 4, 5, 4, 8, 9. I have zero 6s, so all four 6s in the current bid must be in the opponent's hand, which is highly improbable given only eight digits. The maximum total 6s is 8, but having four out of eight in one hand is unlikely, and all four being in the opponent's hand is even more so. Therefore, the bid of 4 6s seems risky and likely an overbid, making a challenge the best option.
