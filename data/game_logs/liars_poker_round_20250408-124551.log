Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative opening bid. I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding '2 8s' is a reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 3, 5, 3, 6, 7, 1, 0, 7, and contains no 8s. The opponent bid '2 8s', implying they might have at least two 8s themselves. Given that I have zero 8s, reaching a higher bid involving 8s or another digit seems risky without strong evidence. However, the current bid of '2 8s' is relatively low and plausible, as it's entirely possible my opponent has two 8s in their eight digits. Without any 8s myself, challenging would be risky because it's not improbable for the opponent to have two 8s. Therefore, it's safer to bid slightly higher on a digit I already possess multiple times. I have two 3s and two 7s, making either digit a good candidate. I'll bid '2 9s' to minimally increase the digit, keeping the bid plausible without committing to a higher quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. It's possible there are at least two 9s in total. I could bid 3 0s, but that's a weak bid. I have two 8s. The previous bid was 2 8s. To increase the bid, I will bid 3 0s.

Player 0 bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one '0'. The current bid is '3 0s', meaning there must be at least two more '0s' in the opponent's hand to make this bid valid. Given each player has 8 digits, it's plausible but uncertain. However, considering I have two '3's, bidding '3 3s' is safer and valid, as it matches the quantity but raises the digit from '0' to '3'. This seems a safer and more strategic move than challenging at this point.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 3S'
Player 1 bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I don't have any 3s in my hand. I can raise the bid to 4 0s, which is higher than 3 3s and avoids using a digit I don't have. I could also bid 3 of a higher number, but increasing the quantity seems safer.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 0S'
Player 0 bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s, and I have exactly one 0 in my hand. With 16 total digits in play (8 per player), Player 0 would need at least three 0s in their hand to meet the bid. Given Player 0 has bid 0s twice, it's plausible they have some 0s, but reaching four 0s total is uncertain. However, considering I have only one 3 in my hand, bidding higher on 3s or another digit without strong evidence is risky. Given the uncertainty and the plausible scenario that Player 0 has several 0s, yet the total of four 0s is not improbable, a small raise to a digit I have multiple of seems safer. I have two 3s, thus bidding 4 3s is risky. However, I also have two 7s. Increasing the bid to 4 7s is risky but possible, as it maintains the quantity and increases the digit, and I already hold two of them myself. This seems safer than a direct challenge at this point.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 1 bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 5 0s is a safe increase in quantity, and 0s have been bid before. Since the current bid is only 4, increasing to 5 seems like a reasonable move without taking too much risk.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 0S'
Player 0 bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 3, 5, 3, 6, 7, 1, 0, and 7. I have exactly one '0'. The opponent has repeatedly bid on zeros, raising from 3 to 4, and then to 5 zeros. For the bid of '5 0s' to be true, the opponent would need at least four zeros in their eight-digit hand. While this is possible, it seems somewhat unlikely given probability. However, given their repeated insistence on zeros, it suggests they might indeed hold multiple zeros. Still, bidding higher (such as '5 1s' or '6 0s') would be risky since I have only one '1' and one '0'. Without stronger evidence to support a higher bid, it's safer to challenge this current bid.
