Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, two 0s, two 8s, one 2, five unique digits in total. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will choose 3 4s, as I have two 4s myself and it's plausible that at least one more exists in the opponent's hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have zero 4s in my hand (77239012). For the bid to be true, the opponent must hold at least three 4s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, it's not guaranteed. Challenging is an option. However, I have two 7s and two 2s. A bid must be higher than 3 4s. I can bid 3 5s, 3 6s, 3 7s, etc., or 4 0s, 4 1s, etc. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Since I hold two 7s, this bid only requires the opponent to hold one 7 for it to be true, which is statistically plausible (expected number of 7s across 16 digits is 1.6). This seems like a safer and more strategic move than challenging the first low bid or making a riskier bid like 4 of something.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7. The current bid is 3 7s, so there must be at least two more 7s in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. Given the distribution of digits, having three or more 7s across both hands is plausible, making a challenge risky. The minimal safe overbid is 3 8s, which increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have two 8s in my hand, so for the bid of 3 8s to be valid, only one more 8 would need to be in Player 1's hand, which is quite reasonable. Thus, a conservative and strategic move is to bid 3 8s.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand (77239012). For the bid to be true, the opponent must have at least three 8s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, this feels like a slightly aggressive bid, especially after they bid 3 4s initially and skipped over 5s, 6s, and 7s (after my 3 7s bid). However, challenging a bid of 3 is still risky early in the game. I have two 7s and two 2s. Bidding 4 7s would build on my previous bid, but Player 0 didn't challenge 3 7s, suggesting they might not have many 7s. Bidding 4 2s seems like a safer option. I have two 2s, so we only need two more 2s from the opponent's 8 digits for the bid to be true. This is statistically plausible (4 out of 16 total digits). It increases the quantity and shifts the digit, putting pressure back on the opponent.

Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) bids: 4 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (24650748), I have only one '2'. The current bid is 4 2s, which requires there to be at least four '2's across both hands. Given I hold just one '2', the opponent would need at least three '2's for the bid to be valid. Since each player has eight digits, it's unlikely the opponent has three or more '2's, as that would mean almost half of their digits are '2's. Statistically, this is improbable, so challenging is the best move.
