--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 0s, two 2s, and two 7s. Bidding 4 2s seems reasonable as it maximizes both quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 2s in my hand, so all 2s must be with Player 0. The bid is 4 2s, which would require Player 0 to have all 4. Given that each player has 8 digits, it's possible but uncertain. Challenging is a good move to test the validity of the bid.
