Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a reasonable bid based on the digits in my hand. I have one 8, one 6, and one 4. Bidding 2 8s seems like a good starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 8.

Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. It's unlikely that the other player has another 9, but it's possible. However, I have two 8s in my hand, making a bid of 3 8s a reasonable and safe move, as it's unlikely the other player has another 8. This bid increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same.
