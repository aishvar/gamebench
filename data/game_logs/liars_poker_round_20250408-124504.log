Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can start with any valid bid. I have two 8s and one 7 in my hand. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 8.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. My hand contains only one '8'. Since there are 16 digits in total, and I have just one '8', it's possible the opponent has at least two more '8's. However, given that the bid is relatively low (3), it is plausible and risky to challenge at this point. Instead, I will make a safe incremental bid by either increasing the digit or quantity slightly. I have two '9's in my hand, making it safer to bid '3 9s', as I already hold two of them myself, requiring only one more across the opponent's eight digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have two 8s in my hand, which makes a bid of 4 8s a reasonable move, increasing the digit while maintaining the quantity. This bid is higher than the current bid of 3 9s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one '8'. The opponent initially bid 3 '8s', then raised to 4 '8s' after my bid of 3 '9s'. Given that I have only one '8', the opponent would need at least three '8s' in their own hand to make their bid valid. With 16 digits total and no strong evidence supporting their claim, it's plausible but risky. However, bidding higher (e.g., 4 '9s' or 5 of any digit) seems even riskier since I only have two '9s'. Given these considerations, challenging the current bid seems safer and more reasonable.
