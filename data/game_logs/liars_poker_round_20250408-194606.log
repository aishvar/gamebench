Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 12931696. I see I have two 1s, one 2, two 6s, one 9, and two other digits. A reasonable starting bid could be based on the most frequent digit in my hand. I have two 6s and two 1s, so bidding on '1s' or '6s' seems reasonable. I'll bid on 6s because it's a relatively high digit. Bidding 3 6s is a safe start, considering there are 8 digits per player and two players.

--- Turn: Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '3 6s' and I hold exactly one 6 in my hand (85301436). This means that for the bid to be valid, my opponent must have at least two 6s among their 8 secret digitsâ€”a statistically unlikely scenario given the odds. Therefore, challenging the bid is the optimal move.
