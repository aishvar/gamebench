Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must open with an initial bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, two 6s, one 0, one 7, one 9, and one 5. Opening with a conservative but solid bid based on my two 6s makes sense, as there is a reasonable chance the opponent also has at least one 6, making at least three 6s plausible.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7. Given the total of 16 digits, the current bid is 3 7s. Since I only see one 7, the other player would need to have at least two 7s to make the bid valid. This is somewhat plausible but risky to assume. To avoid overcommitting, I will raise conservatively by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving to 3 8s, which is a strictly higher bid and buys me more information.

Calculating action for Player 1 (Naive 50/50)
Player 1 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 9s
Player 1 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 46407956, which contains zero 9s. Since I have no 9s and there are only 16 digits total, the current bid of 3 9s would require the opponent to have all three or more 9s. Given the distribution of digits, it's statistically unlikely that the opponent holds 3 or more 9s alone. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
