Round setup complete. Starting bids.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, two 4s, two 7s, one 3, one 6, one 8, and no 0s, 1s, 5s, or 9s. A safe opening bid is typically 2 of a digit I have multiples of. I will open with '2 4s' because I have two 4s myself, making it likely the total count is at least 2.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand 82434726, I have no 5s, so the current bid of 2 5s would require both 5s to be in Player 1's hand, which is possible but not certain. To safely raise, I check my counts: I have two 2s and two 4s. Since the last bid was 2 5s, I can overbid with 2 6s (higher digit, same quantity), and I have two 6s in my hand. This makes the bid credible while incrementally raising the stakes.
