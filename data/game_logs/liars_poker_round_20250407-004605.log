Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand, making it a safe choice to bid on 1s. Bidding 2 1s ensures the total is at least two, which I already have, making it a valid bid. This is a reasonable starting point without being too aggressive.

--- Turn: Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 54035237, I have one 1. The current bid of '2 1s' claims there are at least 2 ones total between both hands. Since I have 1 one, this is quite plausible as my opponent would only need 1 more one for this to be true. Given that I have a strong hand with several higher digits (including a 5, 4, and 7), I can make a strategic bid using one of these. A bid of '2 5s' would be valid as it keeps the same quantity but uses a higher digit, and I know I have at least one 5 myself.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 5s. Without knowledge of Player 1's hand, it's uncertain if they have at least two 5s. Challenging is a reasonable move given the uncertainty and the possibility that Player 1 might be bluffing.
