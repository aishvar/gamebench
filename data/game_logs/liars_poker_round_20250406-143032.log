Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid. I will start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have three 6s and two 5s. A bid of 3 5s seems reasonable given my hand and the fact that it's the first bid.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. Given that there are 3 other players, it's possible that the total count of 5s is at least 3. However, I can make a higher bid based on my hand, which has two 7s. Bidding 4 7s increases the quantity and digit, making it a safe and strategic move.

Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand (06991201), I have zero 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, which requires at least four 7s among all 32 digits. Since I hold none, the remaining 24 digits need to contain all four 7s, which is statistically unlikely. Typically, each digit appears about 3.2 times across all hands (32 digits / 10 digits). Expecting four 7s without any in my hand is a stretch. Therefore, it's a good opportunity to challenge.
