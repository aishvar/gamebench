Requesting action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have two 2s, one 4, one 5, one 6, and one 7 in my hand. A safe starting bid would be to bid on a digit I have. I'll bid 2 2s. This is a reasonable starting point and doesn't reveal too much about my hand.

Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 2 2s. Since I only have one 2, I don't have enough information to confidently bid higher. However, given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only two players with 8 digits each, bidding higher than 2 might be risky without more information. Considering my hand and the fact that I can only see my own digits, challenging the current bid of 2 2s seems like a reasonable move, as it's uncertain whether the total count of 2s across both hands meets or exceeds the bid quantity.
