Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s. Bidding 2 4s is a safe starting point, as it's based on the actual count in my hand and sets a baseline for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. In my hand, I have one 4. Assuming a roughly even distribution of digits, it is likely that there are at least two 4s in total across both hands, and possibly more. To safely increase the bid, I will raise the quantity while choosing a digit I have more of in my hand. I have two 2s, so bidding 3 2s is a reasonable and safe move.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 2s. Since I don't have any 2s, I can't confidently bid higher on 2s. However, I can bid on 4s, increasing the quantity to 4. This is a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity while changing the digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand, and the current bid is 4 4s. This means there need to be at least three more 4s in Player 0's hand to meet the bid. Given the distribution of digits and the fact that I only have one 4, it seems plausible that Player 0 could have three or more 4s. Therefore, I should not challenge at this point. Instead, I will increase the bid to 4 5s, as I have two 5s in my hand, making it reasonable to assume there could be at least two more 5s in Player 0's hand.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 5s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have two 5s, increasing the quantity to 5 5s is not feasible. Instead, I can increase the digit to 4 6s, as I have one 6 in my hand, making it a reasonable bid.

Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s, meaning there need to be at least four 6s across both players' hands. With only two 6s in my hand, it is plausible that Player 0 has at least two more 6s, making the bid reasonable. However, to stay in the game and avoid challenging prematurely, I will increase the bid to 4 7s, as I have one 7 in my hand, and it is possible Player 0 also has some 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, and the current bid is 4 7s. Considering my hand and the possible distribution of digits, it's unlikely there are four 7s in total. Challenging seems like the best move.
