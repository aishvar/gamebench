Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid I want. My hand contains two 6s and two 9s. I can start with a conservative bid to test the waters. Bidding 2 6s seems reasonable as it's based on my own hand and a relatively low digit.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, so I cannot directly support the current bid of 2 6s. However, it is still early in the game, and the bid of 2 6s is relatively low, meaning it is likely there could be at least two 6s between both hands. Challenging now would be premature. To stay in the game, I will make a higher bid of 3 4s, leveraging the fact that I have three 4s in my hand. This bid increases the quantity while switching to a digit I can strongly support.

Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) bids: 3 4s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have two 6s in my hand, and I can see that the bid is still relatively low. Given that I have no 4s, I should consider bidding higher than 3. Since my hand contains two 6s, I can confidently bid on a digit that I have. The current bid is 3 4s, so I need to make a bid that is either higher in quantity or digit. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and digit compared to the current bid.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 6s. Based on my hand, it seems unlikely there are at least 4 6s across both hands, as I hold eight digits and none of them are 6. Given the bid history, Player 0 seems to be increasing the count of 6s, but this could be a bluff. Challenging the bid is the best decision because it seems improbable there are 4 or more 6s in total.
