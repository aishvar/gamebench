Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 6s, two 5s, one 0, one 8, and one 1. Since the current bid is only 1 0s, and I hold at least one 0 myself, it's likely there are more zeros overall. A safe and natural raise is to increase the quantity to 2 0s, which is a minimal but valid higher bid supported by my hand.

Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 2 1s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 1s, so the current bid of 2 1s relies entirely on Player 0 having at least two 1s, which is plausible but not guaranteed. Since I have three 6s and two 5s, I can confidently make a higher bid by increasing the quantity to 3 and choosing a digit I hold multiple of. Bidding 3 6s is a safe and strategic move that leverages my strong hand and puts pressure on Player 0.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 6S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 7s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 6s (digits: 6, 6, 0, 6, 5, 5, 8, 1). The current bid is 3 7s, which I suspect is unlikely because I have no 7s myself, so for there to be at least 3 total 7s, Player 0 would need to hold all three or more, which is improbable. Since I have three 6s, I can confidently raise the bid to 4 6s, which is a safe and higher bid than 3 7s.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 4 7s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (66065581), I have two 6s, one 7, and one 5. The current bid is 4 7s. Since I only hold one 7, for the bid to be true, Player 0 would need to have at least three 7s among their eight digits, which is somewhat unlikely. Given that the naive player steadily increased the 7s bid without much evidence, and considering typical digit distributions, four 7s across both hands seem improbable. Therefore, the best move is to challenge.
