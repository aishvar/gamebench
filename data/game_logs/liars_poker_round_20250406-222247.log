Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, which makes bidding 3 9s a plausible opening since out of 16 total digits, the opponentâ€™s 8 unknown digits have a reasonable chance to contribute at least one more 9. This bid is moderately aggressive and forces the opponent to either raise or risk a challenge.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, and the current bid of 4 0s requires that there be at least three more 0s among the opponent's 8 digits. The probability of the opponent having three or more 0s is roughly 4%, making the bid extremely unlikely to be correct. Thus, I choose to challenge.
