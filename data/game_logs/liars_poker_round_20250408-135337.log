Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 5s, two 1s, and one each of digits 3, 4, and 6. Since there is no current bid, I should start conservatively by bidding a digit I have multiple copies of. Bidding '2 5s' is safe and reasonable, as I already have two 5s myself, making it highly likely that at least two 5s exist in total.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, making it less likely that there are many 5s overall. However, the bid of 2 5s is fairly low, and it's plausible that Player 0 has at least two 5s in their hand. Challenging this bid would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid based on the digits I do have. I have two 9s, so bidding 3 9s is a reasonable and valid move, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 51143653, containing no 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, meaning Player 1 is claiming there are at least three 9s between both our hands. Since I have zero 9s, Player 1 would need to have all three 9s themselves. Given they only have eight digits, having three identical digits (especially 9s) is statistically unlikely. Therefore, challenging this bid seems to be the best action.
