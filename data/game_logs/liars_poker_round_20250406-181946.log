Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 9 and no 0s in my hand. The bid of 1 0s is quite low, and it's possible that there's at least one 0 between the two hands. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 1 1s is a reasonable and safe move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.
