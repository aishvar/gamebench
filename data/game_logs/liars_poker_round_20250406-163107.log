Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable bid. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 3 4s seems like a good starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 4.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have the digits 9, 6, 3, 5, 5, 0, 6, 0. There are no 4s in my hand, so all 4s would have to be in Player 0's hand to meet the bid of 3 4s. Given that Player 0 only has 8 digits, it's unlikely they hold all 3 or more 4s. The probability of them having 3 or more 4s with none in my hand is low. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move.
