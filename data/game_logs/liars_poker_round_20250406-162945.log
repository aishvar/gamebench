Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can start with any valid bid. I have three 3s and two 7s in my hand. Bidding 4 3s seems reasonable, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 3.

Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 3s at all, which makes the existing bid of 4 3s somewhat suspicious. Since there are 16 digits total and I hold zero 3s, all four 3s would have to be in the opponent's hand, which is statistically unlikely. Players on average have about 1.6 instances of any digit, so four is a high count. Given this, challenging now is a strong move.
