Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I need to make a valid bid. I have two 8s in my hand, which is a strong digit. I can start with a bid of 2 8s, which is reasonable given the potential maximum total of 16 digits in play.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (87951712). This means the opponent only needs one 8 for the bid to be true, which is reasonably likely with 8 unknown digits in their hand. Challenging seems risky for such a low bid. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 1s and two 7s. Bidding based on these seems strong. Possible higher bids are 2 9s, 3 0s, 3 1s, etc. Bidding '3 1s' or '3 7s' leverages my hand. '3 7s' is higher than '3 1s'. Bidding '3 7s' requires the opponent to have at least one 7, which is plausible, and it significantly increases the bid from '2 8s'.

Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 7s. Since I have a 7, I can confidently bid higher. I could bid 4 7s, but since I also have two 8s, I can bid 3 8s, which is a higher digit while maintaining the same quantity. This seems like a strong move.

Requesting action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (87951712). For the bid to be true, the opponent needs to have at least two 8s in their 8-digit hand. This is plausible, especially since they initially bid 2 8s and then raised to 3 8s after my bid of 3 7s. Challenging seems risky. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 3 9s or any bid with quantity 4 or higher. I have two 1s and two 7s. Bidding 4 1s is a strong possibility, requiring the opponent to have two 1s. Bidding 4 7s is similar, requiring two 7s from the opponent. Bidding 3 9s requires two 9s from the opponent, while I only have one 9. Bidding 4 1s seems like a safe and informative bid based on my hand, increasing the quantity and putting pressure on the opponent.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 1S'
Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s and one 7 in my hand, but the current bid of 4 1s is quite low compared to the total possible digits. Based on the bids, it seems unlikely that there are 4 1s since the previous bids focused on 7s and 8s. I will challenge the last bid as it seems improbable that there are that many 1s.
