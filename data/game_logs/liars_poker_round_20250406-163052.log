Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s seems like a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 9.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 43052633, I do not have any 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, which means my opponent expects there to be at least three 9s across both hands. Given I have zero 9s, all three or more would have to be in their hand, which is quite unlikely since 3 out of 8 is a high concentration for a specific digit. Therefore, I believe this is a good opportunity to challenge the bid.
