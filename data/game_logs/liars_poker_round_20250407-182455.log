Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two '3's in my hand, I can start with a conservative bid that is likely to be true given the unknown distribution of digits in the opponent's hand. Bidding '2 3s' is a safe starting point as it is based on my own hand and leaves room for the opponent to raise.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 99370486, which contains zero '3's. The current bid is 2 3s, meaning there must be at least two 3s among both hands. Since I have none, both 3s must be in Player 0's hand for the bid to be valid. This is somewhat unlikely, as the probability of exactly two 3s in an 8-digit random hand is modest, and the chance of 3 or more is even lower. Given this, challenging the bid is strategically sound because it is more probable that Player 0 overestimated the total count of 3s.
