Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 23669898, I notice that I have three 8s and two 6s, among other digits. Since I have to make a bid that is strictly higher than 'None', I can start with a digit I have multiple of. Bidding on the 8s seems like a good starting point because I have three of them, which is a significant amount considering the total number of digits each player has. However, to ensure my bid is reasonable and not too aggressive for a starting bid, I'll consider the total possible maximum for any digit is 16 (since each player has 8 digits). Given this, starting with a lower quantity but a higher digit could be strategic. Yet, since I have three 8s, I can confidently bid on those without risking too much, as it leaves room for my opponent to also have some 8s.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The opponent bid 3 8s, meaning they need at least two 8s in their hand. Given the probabilities, there's an 81.2% chance the opponent has fewer than two 8s (0 or 1), making the total less than 3. Challenging now has a high likelihood of success.
