Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand '21759063', I have exactly one 0. The current bid is 1 0s, which accounts for at least one zero across both hands. Since I know I have one zero, it's quite likely that the total number of zeros is at least one, so challenging now would be unwise. A natural minimal raise is to bid 1 1s, which is strictly higher (same quantity, higher digit). I have one '1' in my hand, so the bid is plausible, and it keeps the game progressing without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '2' in my hand, so the current bid of 1 2s is plausible. Since it's early in the game and the bid is low, it's risky to challenge now. I can safely increase the bid by moving to 1 3s, which is a strictly higher digit with the same quantity, maintaining a conservative approach while putting pressure on Player 0.

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 1 4s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 1 4s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand '21759063', I do not have any 4s, making it unlikely there are many 4s overall. The current bid is only 1 4s, which is very plausible since the opponent could easily have one 4. Challenging now would likely lose. To continue safely, I can make a minimal valid higher bid. I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding 2 5s is reasonable and increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 5s

--- Turn: Player 0 (Naive 50/50) ---
Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 2 6s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s, implying at least one more 6 in Player 0's hand. This is plausible. To raise, I can either bid 2 7s or increase the quantity. Since I have two 0s, a safe and strategic higher bid is 2 7s, which minimally increases the digit without committing to a higher quantity.
