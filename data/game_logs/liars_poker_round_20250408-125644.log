Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a reasonable bid based on the digits in my hand. I have two 2s, two 1s, and one 4. Bidding 3 2s is a safe starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 2.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 53948770, which contains no digit '2'. Considering there are 16 total digits in play (8 per player), and I have none, the opponent would need to have at least three '2's in their own 8 digits. While this is possible, it seems slightly risky. However, the bid of '3 2s' is relatively low, and it's plausible that the opponent has at least two or three '2's themselves. Challenging at this point seems unnecessarily risky. Instead, I will make a conservative higher bid. I have two '7's in my hand, making it safer to bid '3 7s'. This bid is strictly higher (same quantity but higher digit) and supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have a 7 in my hand. Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity of the same digit. This bid is likely to be valid, as there are 16 digits in total and it's possible for another 7 to exist in the opponent's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, meaning at least four 7s across both hands. Since I already have two 7s, Player 0 would need at least two 7s for their bid to hold. Given Player 0 raised my previous bid from 3 to 4 7s, it's plausible they have at least two 7s themselves. Therefore, challenging seems risky. I should instead bid higher. However, bidding 4 8s or higher seems uncertain as I have only one 8. To minimize risk, I will bid 4 8s, increasing the digit but keeping the quantity the same, as it is the next safest bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand, so it's unlikely that there are four 8s in total. Challenging seems like the best move.
