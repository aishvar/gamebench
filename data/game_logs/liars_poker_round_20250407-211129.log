Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there has been no bid yet, I must open the bidding. Looking at my hand '46792801', the counts of each digit are: 0 (1), 1 (1), 2 (1), 3 (0), 4 (1), 5 (0), 6 (1), 7 (1), 8 (1), 9 (1). Typically, opening with a bid on a digit I have at least one of is strategic, and bidding '2' of a digit I hold once is reasonable because it is likely there is at least one more in the opponent's hand. Among these, bidding '2' of a common digit like '8' is standard. Therefore, I will start with an opening bid of '2 8'.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 8s'. In my hand (78033476), I have no 8s at all. Since I can't validate the current bid and I believe it is unlikely that there are 2 eights among both hands, I will challenge the bid.
