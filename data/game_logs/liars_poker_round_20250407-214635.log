Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player, I can choose any digit and quantity to bid. I have two 3s in my hand, so bidding three 3s is a reasonable starting point. This assumes the opponent has at least one 3, making the total three. If they don't, the bid is invalid, but it's a calculated risk.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (41644183), I have one '3'. The current bid is 3 threes, which means across both hands there must be at least 3 threes. Since I have only one, the opponent would need at least 2 threes for the bid to be valid. This is plausible, but somewhat risky. To avoid challenging too early, I can safely raise the bid to a slightly higher but still plausible count or a higher digit with a lower count. Since I have three '4's, bidding 3 4s is a strong strategic move because I already hold three, making it likely valid, and it raises the bid properly.

--- Turn: Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 fours, and I have no fours in my hand. Given that the previous bid was 3 threes, it's likely that the opponent is bluffing by increasing the digit without increasing the quantity. Challenging this bid is a strategic move to test the opponent's bluff.
