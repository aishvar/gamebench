Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my first turn. I need to make an initial bid. I will analyze my hand to determine a good starting bid. My hand contains the digits: 3, 9, 1, 7, 0, 2, 9, 1. The digit '9' appears twice, which is the highest count of any single digit in my hand. Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid to gauge the opponent's hand. I will bid on the digit '9' with a quantity of 2, as it's a relatively high digit with a known quantity in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my first turn. I should make a conservative bid to test the waters. I have a 3 in my hand, which is a relatively low digit. Given that there are 16 digits in total (8 from each player), bidding on a low digit like 3 seems reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 twos. Looking at my hand (27186448), I have only one '2'. To meet the bid, the combined total must be at least 3 twos. Since I have 1, the opponent would need at least 2 twos in their 8 digits. While this is possible, it's somewhat unlikely, as 2 or more twos in 8 digits is not the most common. Therefore, challenging is a reasonable move here, as the bid may be an overstatement.
