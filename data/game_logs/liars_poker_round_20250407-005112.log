Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Starting with the first bid, I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 2 0s is safe since I can guarantee at least that count. Choosing a lower digit early allows room for future bids to increase either quantity or digit value.

--- Turn: Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, and the current bid is 2 0s. Since I cannot increase the quantity of 0s based on my hand, I need to bid on a different digit. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding 3 1s is a reasonable move, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Player 1 (cohere/command-a:floor) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. Since I have none, the opponent must have at least three 1s in their 8 digits. While possible, it's a high count given only 8 digits. I'll challenge to test the validity.
