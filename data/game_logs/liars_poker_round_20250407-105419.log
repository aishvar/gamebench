Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand without much risk. I see I have two 6s and two 7s in my hand. A bid of 2 7s seems reasonable as a starting point, given that I have two 7s and no information about the other player's hand.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand and one 0. The current bid is only 2 7s. Bidding 3 9s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 6s and one 7, and other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 3 9s, I should either increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 6s and no 9s, so bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and digit compared to the previous bids.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. I can make a valid higher bid by bidding 5 6s, increasing the quantity based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, and I know that Player 1 has at least 5 6s in total from their previous bid of 5 6s. Given that I have a total of 3 6s in my hand, I should challenge this bid because it's highly unlikely that there are 5 6s in total between both players.
