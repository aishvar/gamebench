Requesting action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that the other player has at least one 8.

Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which means Player 0 is implying there are at least two more 8s in their hand. Given that the probability of having two 8s in an 8-digit hand is not extremely high, I think it's reasonable to challenge the bid.
