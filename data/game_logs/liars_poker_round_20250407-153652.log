--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand (43523728), the digit '3' appears twice, '2' appears twice, '4', '5', '7', and '8' appear once each, and '0', '1', '6', '9' do not appear. A safe opening bid is usually on a digit I have multiple of to maximize the likelihood. Therefore, I'll bid 2 of '3' since I have two 3s myself, making it quite likely there are at least 2 in total.

--- Turn: Player 1 (Random(openrouter/cohere/command-a:floor)) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (Random(openrouter/cohere/command-a:floor)), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. My hand contains no 3s, so I cannot make a higher bid for 3s. Since the maximum possible 3s across both hands is 2 (if the other player has 2), the current bid is already at the maximum possible value. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
