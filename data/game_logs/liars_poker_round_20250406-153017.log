--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, two 0s, two 8s, one 4, one 7, three 2s, and one 3. A safe and reasonable opening bid is 2 6s, reflecting my two 6s, which is unlikely to be immediately challenged and leaves room for escalation.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 2 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (93677921), so the total count of 6s must be at least 1. I can bid higher than 2 6s. A reasonable next bid could be to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about other digits, I'll increase the quantity. Bidding 3 6s is a safe and reasonable move.

Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which means at least two are accounted for. The current bid is 3 6s, so my opponent is suggesting there is at least one more 6 in their hand. This is plausible, as it's common to have one or two of a digit in a hand of eight. Since 3 6s is reasonable, challenging now would likely lose. To increase the bid, I can either go to 3 7s or 4 6s. Given that I only have one 7 but two 6s, a safer bid is 4 6s, leveraging my known count and implying my opponent might have two 6s as well. This is a reasonable escalation.

Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (93677921), so the total count of 6s is at least 1 (mine) plus the count in Player 0's hand. The bid of 4 6s implies that Player 0 has at least 3 sixes. While possible, it's a bit aggressive. However, I can bid higher. I can either increase the quantity or change the digit to a higher one. Since I have multiple 9s and 7s, I can consider bidding on 7s or 9s as they are higher than 6. Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable next step as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 7S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (64607832), I have one 7. The current bid is 4 7s, meaning there must be at least four 7s among all 16 digits. Since I only have one, the opponent would need at least three 7s, which is somewhat unlikely given typical digit distribution. The previous bids escalated from 6s to 7s at the same quantity, indicating the opponent might not have many 7s but wanted to push the digit higher to avoid increasing quantity. Given the statistical unlikelihood of four or more 7s overall, challenging is the best move.
