--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 8. Opening with a conservative but reasonable bid, I will choose 2 0s, as I already hold two myself, making it likely or certain to be true.

--- Turn: Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, which means the entire burden of meeting the bid relies on my opponent's 8 digits. Statistically, the probability that 8 random digits contain at least 2 zeros is very low (around 18.7%). Given the high likelihood that the total number of 0s is less than 2, challenging the current bid is the optimal move.
