Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have two 8s, one 4, one 6, two 4s, one 2, and one 5 in my hand. A conservative first bid would be based on the digit I have the most of, which is 4. Bidding 2 4s is a reasonable opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s, which is quite low given the number of digits in play. I have a 9 in my hand, so I can reasonably bid 3 9s, increasing the digit.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding higher in quantity with 9s would be a bluff. I have two 8s, so bidding 4 8s is a reasonable option to increase the quantity. Alternatively, I could challenge, as 3 9s seems high, but I prefer to make a bid based on my hand.

Player 0 bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Considering my hand, I have two 8s, which supports the current bid of 4 8s. However, I also have two 9s, which could be used to make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 4 8s, I can increase both the quantity and the digit to 5 9s, making a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. The previous bids show a pattern of escalating bids. Bidding 6 9s is a reasonable escalation, though risky given my hand. However, bidding a different digit with a higher quantity is also an option. I have two 8s, so bidding 5 8s is not higher than the previous bid of 4 8s. I have two 4s, but increasing the quantity to 6 4s isn't a strong play. Bidding 6 0s is possible, but given the previous bids focusing on higher digits, it's less likely to succeed. Therefore, I'll bid 6 9s, hoping the opponent is bluffing.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 7 9s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Player 1 bids: 7 9s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Given the bid history, Player 1 seems very confident in 9s. However, with only 16 total digits, 7 9s is plausible but not guaranteed. I have two 8s, so bidding 8 8s is a reasonable attempt to increase the bid, and it's based on a digit I actually hold. Bidding 7 9s is not allowed as it's not a higher bid. Bidding 8 9s is too risky given my hand. Challenging is also an option, but I think Player 1 may have more 9s than I suspect. Therefore, I'll bid 8 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 8s, and I have two 8s in my hand. I can confidently bid 9 8s, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 1 bids: 9 8s

--- Turn: Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Given the bid history, Player 1 seems very confident in 8s and 9s. Bidding higher on 8s is risky as I only have two. Bidding on 9s is also risky, as Player 1 has already shown a strong preference for it. The maximum possible quantity is 16. Considering my hand, bidding 10 8s is possible but very risky. A challenge seems more reasonable, as 9 8s is a high number and feels unlikely given the previous bids and my hand. It's a calculated risk, but potentially more rewarding than escalating the bid further.
