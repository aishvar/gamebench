--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid. I will start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 6s and two 8s. A bid of '2 8s' seems reasonable as a starting point.

Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 2 8s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 8s (digits are 0, 2, 2, 9, 1, 3, 0, 2). Since I hold 8 digits and none are 8s, the likelihood that there are at least two 8s among the remaining 16 digits is plausible, but not guaranteed. Given that the bid is relatively low (only 2 8s) and it's early in the bidding, challenging now is risky because the probability that there are at least two 8s total is still fairly high. Therefore, a safer strategic move is to increase the bid slightly. I have three 2s in my hand, so I can confidently bid 3 2s, which is a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and leverages my hand strength.

Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s and one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s. Since I only have one 2, it's unlikely that there are more than 3 2s in total. However, I can increase the digit to make a higher bid. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more likely to succeed. My hand contains 2 sixes (6s appear twice). Given that the previous bid was 4 6s and I have two 6s, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand does not have a lot of high digits, I should consider what I can reasonably bid. The bid must be higher than 4 6s, so I should either increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 6s, so bidding a higher quantity with a lower digit or the same quantity with a higher digit could be strategic. However, I should also consider if there's a possibility that the total count of 6s is already high, making my bid risky.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 5 7S'
Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (02291302), I have zero 7s. Given 24 digits total and no 7s on my side, for Player 0's bid of 5 7s to be valid, the other two players combined would need to hold all five or more 7s. Statistically, each player averages about 2.4 of any digit (24 digits / 10 digits), so five 7s is quite aggressive. Since I have none, hitting five 7s across the other two hands is unlikely. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) challenges Player 0's (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) bid of 5 7s.
Revealed Hands: P0(meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor):96185138 | P1(openrouter/quasar-alpha):02291302 | P2(mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor):46187569
Actual count of 7s across all hands: 1
Challenge Successful! Actual count (1) < Bid quantity (5).
Winner: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha)
Losers: Players 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor)
