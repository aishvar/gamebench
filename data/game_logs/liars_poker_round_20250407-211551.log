Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s and two 9s, as well as one each of 0, 3, 4. The safest opening bid is usually on a digit I have multiple of. Bidding on 2 or more 1s or 9s is reasonable, but since I have two 1s, starting with '2 1s' is a solid conservative opening bid, as the total across both hands is likely to be at least 2.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 1s'. I have no 1s in my hand. The maximum possible number of 1s across both hands is 8. Since the bid is '2 1s', it is likely that the opposing player does not have any 1s either. Therefore, it is safe to challenge the bid.
