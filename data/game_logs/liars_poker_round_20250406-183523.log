--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Looking at my hand 20851991, I have two 1s, two 9s, one 0, one 2, one 5, and one 8. The most common digits in my hand are 1s and 9s, each appearing twice. A reasonable conservative opening bid is 2 1s, which reflects my hand and leaves room for escalation.

--- Turn: Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand, making it safe to bid 3 4s. This bid is higher than the current bid of 2 1s and is guaranteed to be valid since the total number of 4s will be at least three.

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 20851991, which contains two 1s, zero 4s, one 0, one 2, one 5, one 8, and one 9. The current bid is 3 4s. Since I have zero 4s, for the bid to be valid, my opponent would need to have at least 3 or 4 of them, which is statistically unlikely given only 8 digits in their hand. The expected average count of any digit is around 1.6 (16 digits / 10 digits). Having 3 or more 4s total with none in my hand is unlikely, so I will challenge.
