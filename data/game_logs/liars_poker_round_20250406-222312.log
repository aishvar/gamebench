Requesting action from Player 0 (openai/o3-mini-high), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 5s in my hand, which guarantees that there are at least two 5s among the 16 total digits. Since this is the opening bid and no bid has been made yet, I want to choose a bid that I can safely back up. Bidding '2 5s' is a secure play that leverages the strength in my hand and forces my opponent to either raise the bid or eventually face a challenge if they overstate their hand.
