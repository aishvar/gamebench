Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand (digits 0, 0, and 0). Given that the current bid is only 1 0s, I can confidently raise the bid to at least 3 0s, knowing that I already hold that many. This is a safe and strategic higher bid.

Calculating action for Player 0 (Naive 50/50)
Player 0 (Naive) chose to BID: 3 1s
Player 0 (Naive 50/50) bids: 3 1s

--- Turn: Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 0s and no 1s. The current bid is 3 1s, which requires at least three 1s between both hands. Since I have zero 1s, that would mean Player 0 must have all three or more 1s, which is unlikely given the distribution of digits. With 8 digits per player, the expected count of any digit is roughly 1.6, so three 1s on their side is a stretch. Therefore, challenging this bid is statistically favorable.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'CHALLENGE'
