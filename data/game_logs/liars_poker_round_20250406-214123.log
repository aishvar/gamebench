Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must start the bidding. Looking at my hand, I have three 2s, two 3s, and one each of 1, 5, and 7. Starting with a conservative but reasonable opening bid, I will bid 3 2s, reflecting my strong count of 2s and leaving room to escalate.

--- Turn: Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) ---
Requesting action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 2s', I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Looking at my hand, 40896694, I notice I have no 2s but I do have multiple occurrences of higher digits. Since I have two 6s and two 9s, and considering the bid needs to be higher in either quantity or digit, bidding on one of these digits could be a good strategy. However, since I don't have enough information about Player 0's hand and given that my highest digits are 9s, I should consider bidding on a digit that I have a good number of, but also consider the likelihood of Player 0 having the same or higher. Given my hand doesn't contain any 2s, and assuming Player 0 might have at least one 2 to make such a bid, I should look to increase the quantity or digit significantly. Bidding on 4 6s seems reasonable because it increases the quantity and moves to a higher digit, both of which are higher than the current bid of '3 2s'.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 4 6S'
Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) bids: 4 6s

--- Turn: Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha) ---
Requesting action from Player 0 (openrouter/quasar-alpha), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (53137222), I have four 2s and zero 6s. The current bid is 4 6s, which requires there to be at least four 6s among all 16 digits. Since I hold none, Player 1 would need to have all four or more 6s alone, which is unlikely. Given typical digit distribution, four or more 6s in one hand is improbable, so challenging is the best move.
