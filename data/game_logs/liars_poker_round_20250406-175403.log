Requesting action from Player 1 (openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I don't have any 0s in my hand, but the bid is very low. I can safely raise the bid to 2 1s. This is still a conservative bid, and it forces the other player to make a more informed decision.
