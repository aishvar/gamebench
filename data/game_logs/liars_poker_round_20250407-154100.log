Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I can see my entire hand (50938807) which contains 1 zero. Since the current bid is '1 0s', and I know I have 1 zero myself, it's very likely there are more zeros in the opponent's hand. With 8 digits in the opponent's hand, the probability of them having at least 1 zero is quite high. Therefore, I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. Given my knowledge of my own zeros, bidding '2 0s' would be a safe play as it's likely to be true across both hands.
