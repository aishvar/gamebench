Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 21808983, I have: one 0, two 1s, one 2, one 3, two 8s, and one 9. Since this is the first bid and I have two 8s, I can start with a conservative bid knowing there are likely more 8s among the other 40 digits held by other players. A bid of '3 8s' is reasonable as I already see two 8s, and only need one more among 40 remaining digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 8s and my hand 79502374, which does not contain any 8s, I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Since the bid is relatively low and there are 48 total digits, it's plausible that there could be at least 3 8s among all players. However, without having any 8s in my hand, I don't have direct information to confidently increase the bid on 8s. Considering the rules, to make a higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Given that my hand contains two 7s and other digits, I could consider bidding on a digit I have, but since the current bid is on 8s, I would need to either match the digit and increase the quantity or move to a higher digit if I were to bid. Since I don't have an 8 or a 9, and increasing to 4 8s might be risky without knowing the distribution of 8s among other players, I should look for a safer option or challenge if I think the current bid is unlikely. Given the total number of digits and players, challenging seems like a reasonable option if I believe the bid is unlikely, but since 3 8s is not extremely high and could realistically exist, I should consider if making a bid on a different digit, based on my hand, is more strategic.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand (from 45067995). The current bid is 4 7s, which means there are at least two more 7s among the other five players (since I have two). Given that there are 40 other digits (5 players * 8 digits each), it's plausible that there are at least two more 7s. However, bidding higher would require either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since increasing the quantity to 5 7s seems risky (as it would require three more 7s from others), I can instead bid the same quantity but a higher digit. I have one 9 in my hand, so bidding 4 9s is a safer option, as it's less likely to be challenged and still follows the rules of increasing the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding higher in quantity with 9s is risky as it relies on other players having them. I can bid 5 0s, 5 1s, 5 4s, 5 6s, 5 7s or 5 8s. I have one 0, two 1s, two 4s, one 6, one 7 and zero 8s. Bidding 5 1s seems most reasonable based on my hand. Alternatively, challenging seems viable since 4 9s is a relatively high bid and I have no 9s. However, challenging early might be too aggressive. I will bid 5 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I need to make a higher bid either by increasing the quantity or the digit. I have one '1' in my hand, so the bid of 5 1s might be reasonable. To raise, I can increase the quantity to 6 with any digit or keep it at 5 and increase the digit. Since 6 1s might be risky without more '1's, I look at other digits. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 5 6s is valid and might be safer. However, increasing quantity to 6 with a digit I have (like 6) would be stronger. I will bid 6 6s to increase quantity and use a digit I have twice, making the bid plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, so I know there are at least 2 6s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits in total. The bid of 6 6s implies that there are at least 6 sixes across all players. I need to either challenge this bid or make a higher bid. My hand has 2 sixes, so the total count of 6s is at least 2. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll consider the probability and the current bid. Bidding 7 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 21808983, I have zero 6s. The current bid of 7 6s means there need to be at least 7 sixes among all 48 digits. While this is mathematically possible, the bidding sequence shows aggressive escalation, and Player 5 increased both the quantity and kept the same digit as Player 4's bid. Given I have no 6s in my hand and would need 7 sixes to exist in the remaining 40 digits (48 - 8 in my hand), this seems unlikely. The safer play is to challenge rather than escalate to 7 7s or 8 of any digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s. With 5 players having 8 digits each (40 total), starting with a conservative bid of 3 8s is reasonable. I know this is safe since I can see two 8s myself, and it's likely there's at least one more 8 among the other 32 digits I can't see. This was also a successful opening bid in the previous round. Starting with a moderate bid allows room for the bidding to progress naturally.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 3 8s and I have one 8 in my hand (79502374), increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same or increasing the digit with the same quantity could be viable. However, considering the total digits remaining (40) and that I only have one 8, bidding higher on 8s might not be the best strategy. Since my hand contains a 7 and a 9, and considering the game history where bids on digits like 7 and 9 have been made, I should look for an opportunity to bid on a digit that I have knowledge of. Given that I have a 9 in my hand and no recent bids have focused on it, and considering I need to make a higher bid than 3 8s, bidding on 9s could be a good strategy. The quantity should be higher than 3 to ensure the bid is considered higher. Thus, bidding 4 9s seems like a reasonable move, considering I have one 9 and it's a digit that hasn't been recently bid on, giving me an edge in terms of information about the hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 4 9s, which means there needs to be at least two more 9s among the other four players (since I have two). Given that there are 32 other digits (4 players * 8 digits each), it's plausible but not certain. I can either bid higher by increasing the quantity to 5 9s or switch to a higher digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, I can only increase the quantity. However, 5 9s might be risky. Alternatively, I can challenge, but with two 9s in my hand, it's possible the bid is valid. I'll make a conservative bid of 5 0s, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit low to minimize risk.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have zero 0s in my hand. Player 1 bid 4 9s, and Player 0 bid 3 8s. Given the previous rounds and the elimination of Player 5 for overbidding on 6s, a high bid seems risky. I can bid 6 0s, which is a valid higher bid. However, since I have no 0s, challenging seems like the better option. The current bid of 5 0s seems high considering only 40 digits are in play across 5 players.

Player 3 Reasoning: It's the start of a new round with 32 total digits and 4 players. The previous rounds saw aggressive bidding and successful challenges. I have two 1s and one 4. Given the recent history, a conservative bid is wise. Player 0 bid 3 8s last round, and Player 1 bid 4 9s. Player 2 bid 5 0s before being challenged. I will bid 4 1s, as I have two in my hand, and it's a reasonable starting point, increasing the quantity from the previous bids. It's not overly aggressive, and it's based on what I hold.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one '1' in my hand (the digit '1' is not present in my hand 49683567). Given that the bid is relatively low and I have no '1's, it is reasonable to increase the bid. The next higher bid must be either quantity 5 or quantity 4 with a digit higher than 1. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 4 6s is a valid and reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (21808983), I have zero 6s. The current bid claims there are 4 sixes among all players. With only 32 total digits remaining (8 per player, 4 players), and knowing I have none, this means the other 3 players would need to have at least 4 sixes between them. While possible, this seems unlikely given the relatively conservative bidding pattern shown in the game history. Additionally, Player 4 increased only the digit (not quantity) from the previous bid of 4 1s, which could indicate they're stretching. Given I have zero 6s and can see that at least 1/4 of the remaining digits definitely don't contain a 6, challenging seems like the optimal move.

Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s. With 24 total digits in play (8 digits × 3 players), starting with a conservative bid is wise. Since I have two 8s already, bidding 3 8s is relatively safe as I only need one more 8 between the other two players' 16 digits. This has worked well for me as an opening bid in previous rounds, and the digit 8 is high enough to give room for others to bid over it if they want to increase the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 8s and my hand of 79502374, I notice I don't have any 8s. Considering the total digits remaining are 24 and there are 3 active players, each with 8 digits, the bid of 3 8s seems plausible but not extremely high. However, without any 8s in my hand and given the history of challenges and eliminations, I should consider the likelihood of there being at least 3 8s among the remaining digits. Since I don't have personal evidence (from my hand) to support or refute the existence of 3 8s strongly, and given that the last few bids were challenged due to being too high, I must weigh the risk of bidding higher against the potential of challenging. The last bid of 3 8s is not excessively high, but challenging it could provide insight into the distribution of 8s. However, since my hand does not contain any 8s, and I do not have sufficient information to confidently challenge or bid higher based on the digit's presence in my hand, I must consider the strategic aspect of bidding or challenging. Given the information and the goal to make a strategic move, bidding higher on a digit I have more information about or challenging based on the likelihood of the bid being true are my options. Since my hand contains two 7s and other digits but no 8s, and considering the need to make a strictly higher bid or challenge, I should think about the probability of higher digits or quantities being present. Given the constraints and the need for a strategic move, I should consider what would be a reasonable next step given the current bid and the history of the game.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 7s seems risky, as it's already a relatively high bid with only 24 total digits remaining. I could bid 4 8s, but that relies on Player 0 having at least one 8, and they just bid 3 8s. Bidding 5 7s is also risky.

Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (21808983), I have only one 1.
