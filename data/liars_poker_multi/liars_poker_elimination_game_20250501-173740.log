Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 53492198, which contains a variety of digits. I have two 9s, which is a relatively high count for a single digit in my hand. A reasonable starting bid could be based on the count of one of the digits I have. Bidding 5 9s seems like a cautious start, considering there are 6 players and the total count of digits is 48.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 5 9s, which means there needs to be at least three more 9s among the other five players (since I have two). With five players left, each having 8 digits, it's possible but risky. I can either bid higher by increasing the quantity to 6 9s or switch to a higher digit like 0s. Since I have one 0 in my hand, bidding 5 0s is not higher than 5 9s. Bidding 6 9s seems too aggressive, so I'll challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. My hand is 53492198, which contains one 9. With 5 players remaining and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in total. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but not too low. I have one 9, so there are at least 4 more 9s needed to make a bid of 5 9s plausible. It's a relatively safe starting point given the total number of digits is 40.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 0's bid of 5 9s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (33268204), I don't have any 9s. Player 0 has bid 5 9s twice now - once in the previous round where it was verified to be true (there were exactly 5 9s), and now again in this round. This is suspicious since the total digits decreased from 48 to 40, making it less likely that the same quantity of 9s exists. However, Player 0 might have several 9s in their hand and be confident in this bid. Since I don't have any 9s, and the previous round confirmed exactly 5 9s existed, I think it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I'll bid 6 0s since I have one 0 in my hand, and it's a reasonable increment.

Player 3 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 2's bid of 6 0s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (40276236), I have only one 0. For there to be at least 6 zeros total, the other 4 players would need to have at least 5 zeros among them, which is certainly possible (averaging just over 1 zero per player). Since I can't confidently challenge, I should make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity to 7 0s or keep the quantity at 6 but increase the digit. Since I have two 2s in my hand, bidding on 2s gives me more confidence. I'll bid 6 2s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. My hand (05115381) contains two 5s and zero 2s. Bidding 6 5s is a valid higher bid, maintaining the quantity at 6 but increasing the digit from 2 to 5. This bid is supported by the two 5s in my hand, meaning I am claiming there are at least four more 5s among the other four players. With 40 total digits, this is a plausible claim and a strategic move based on my hand strength. Challenging 6 2s is also an option since I have no 2s, but 6 is not an exceptionally high bid for 40 digits, making a challenge potentially risky. Bidding based on my hand is the preferred move here.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Given the previous round's history where a bid of 5 9s was successful, and the total digits remaining are 40, a bid of 7 5s is possible but risky. However, bidding 6 6s is a safe increase in digit, and I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding higher in quantity on a digit I don't have is too risky. Therefore, I will bid 6 6s.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (from 53492198). The total count of 6s across all players must be at least 2 (mine) plus potentially 6s held by other players. Given that there are 4 other players and each has 8 digits, it's plausible that there are more 6s. However, bidding higher than 6 6s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. I can bid 7 6s or 6 7s. Since I don't have any 7s, I'm less confident in the count of 7s across all players. However, considering the progression of bids and the fact that the quantity has been steady at 6, I should assess the likelihood of the count being higher than 6 for 6s. I have two 6s, so if others have a similar or higher proportion, the total count could be reasonable. I'll take a cautious approach and bid 7 6s, increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge Player 0's bid of 7 6s. Looking at my hand (33268204), I have one 6. For Player 0's bid to be valid, there need to be at least 6 more 6s among the other players' hands. With 5 active players each having 8 digits, there are 40 total digits. If digits were evenly distributed, we'd expect about 4 of each digit (40 total digits รท 10 possible digits). Player 0 has already bid aggressively by raising from 6 6s to 7 6s, which suggests they might have multiple 6s. However, requiring 7 total when I only have 1 means the other 4 players would need to average 1.5 sixes each, which is somewhat above the expected distribution. Since I'm next in the rotation after Player 0's bid, I'll challenge as I think 7 6s is slightly optimistic.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I'm starting this round as Player 2 with hand 33268204. Since I'm the first to bid in this round, I need to make a strategic opening bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, one 2, one 6, one 8, one 0, and one 4. The most frequent digit in my hand is 3, which appears twice. A conservative opening bid would be to claim there are at least 3 of my most frequent digit (3s) across all players. This is reasonable because I already have 2 in my hand, and there's a good chance at least one more exists among the other 24 digits held by other players. This is a safe starting bid that doesn't overcommit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. My hand is 40276236, which contains one 3. The current bid is '3 3s' made by Player 2. With 4 active players having 8 digits each (32 total digits), there could be up to 32 3s theoretically, though that's extremely unlikely. Since I have one 3 in my hand, there need to be at least 2 more 3s among the other 24 digits held by other players to make the current bid valid. This seems quite reasonable. I could challenge, but the risk seems high given the low bid quantity. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s and two 6s. I could bid '3 4s' (increasing the digit) or '4 3s' (increasing the quantity). Since I only have one 3, bidding '4 3s' would be risky. I'll bid '3 6s' since I have two 6s in my hand, making it a safer bid than other options while still being valid (same quantity but higher digit).

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains three 1s. The current bid is 3 6s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 1s is necessary. I have two 6s, so bidding 4 6s or higher seems reasonable. However, given the history of challenges and eliminations, and the relatively low total digits remaining (32), a high bid could be risky. I will bid 4 2s, increasing the quantity while choosing a digit I don't have, making a challenge more likely to succeed if I decide to challenge later.

I could challenge, but it's risky since the bid is relatively low and reasonable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Since I have two 3s in my hand, bidding 4 3s seems reasonable - keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value. This is a safe increment that leverages my hand strength.

Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze my hand and the current bid situation. In my hand (40276236), I have one 3. Since there are 4 players with 8 digits each (32 total digits), and Player 2 has bid '4 3s', I need to determine if this is reasonable. If each player has roughly the same distribution, we'd expect about 3-4 of each digit total. Since I only have one 3, that means there would need to be 3 more 3s among the other players for the bid to be valid. This is certainly possible. Looking at my options, I could bid '4 4s', '4 5s', '4 6s', '4 7s', '4 8s', '4 9s', or increase the quantity to '5' of any digit. I have two 6s in my hand, which gives me some confidence in bidding on 6s. I'll bid '4 6s' since I know I have two of them myself, making this a safer bid than increasing the quantity.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand is 05115381, which contains zero 6s. This makes the bid of 4 6s slightly suspicious, but 4 is not an extremely high bid for 32 total digits (average expectation is 3.2). Challenging has a significant risk. My hand is strong in 1s (three) and 5s (two). I need to make a bid strictly higher than 4 6s. Bidding 5 1s is a valid higher bid (quantity 5 > quantity 4). I have three 1s, meaning the other three players collectively need at least two 1s for the bid to be true. With 24 digits among them, the expected number of 1s is 2.4, so needing two is quite plausible. Bidding 5 1s is well-supported by my hand and statistically reasonable.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. Bidding 6 1s would be a lie, and given the history of challenges, it's likely someone else also has few or no 1s. I have two 6s, so bidding 5 6s is a valid option. However, Player 3 bid 4 6s previously, so a bid of 5 6s is not significantly better. I have two 6s and two 2s. Bidding 5 2s is a possibility, but 1s are generally more common than 2s. Considering the previous rounds and Player 4's bid, 5 1s seems high. I will challenge the bid.

This is possible but not guaranteed. Looking at my options: I could bid 5 7s, but that's risky since I only know of one 7. I could bid 4 8s or 4 9s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity. I could also bid 5 of a lower digit. Since I have two 6s in my hand, bidding 5 6s seems reasonable - I know of two, so I need three more between the other players, which is plausible with 16 unknown digits between them.

Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. My hand contains 8 digits: 33268204. I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 6 6s made by Player 5. For this bid to be true, there would need to be 5 more 6s between Player 3 and Player 5's hands (since I have 1). With 8 digits per player, it's possible but seems somewhat high. Looking at the bidding pattern, Player 5 and Player 3 have both shown interest in 6s, suggesting they might have some in their hands. However, Player 5 jumping from 5 6s to 6 6s could be a bluff. I could challenge, but it's risky if they actually have the 6s. Alternatively, I could bid 7 6s, but that would be very risky given I only have 1 six. A safer option would be to bid 6 7s (same quantity but higher digit) or 6 8s. Since I have an 8 in my hand, bidding 6 8s seems reasonable as I'm contributing to that count.

In previous rounds, Player 2 has been willing to challenge when they believed a bid was false. Their bid of 6 8s might be a bluff to try to get me to make an even higher bid.

Since I'm making the first bid of the round, I want to start with something reasonably safe but not too low. Looking at previous rounds, Player 5 seems to favor bidding on 6s (they bid on 6s twice in previous rounds), which suggests they might have some 6s in their hand. Given that I already have two 6s, bidding on 6s could be strategic. I'll start with a bid of 3 6s, suggesting there's at least one more 6 in Player 5's hand, which seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Player 3 bid 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 4 6s would be a reasonable increase, but given the limited number of digits remaining (16 total, and Player 3 and I each have 8), and the recent history of challenges succeeding, I suspect Player 3 is bluffing. A bid of 4 6s is risky. Challenging seems like the best option, as even if I have two 6s, the opponent only needs one more to win, and it's unlikely there are two more 6s in their hand.
