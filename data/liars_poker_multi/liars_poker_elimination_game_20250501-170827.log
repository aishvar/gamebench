Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the opening bidder I want a safe, modest bid that leverages information from my own hand while leaving room for later increases. I hold two 6s myself. With 40 unknown digits remaining among five other players, the expected number of additional 6s is about 4, so the probability that there are at least three 6s overall is extremely high. Therefore bidding 3 6s is a low-risk way to start the round and meets the requirement of being strictly higher than the nonexistent current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (59867890). With 6 players total and 8 digits per player, there are 48 total digits in play. For the bid of '3 6s' to be valid, I need at least 2 more 6s among the other 5 players' hands (since I have 1). That's only 2 out of 40 remaining digits needing to be 6s, which is quite reasonable. Each digit has roughly 1/10 probability, so we'd expect about 4 sixes in those 40 digits. I should make a higher bid. I could bid '3 7s', but I don't have any 7s in my hand. I do have one 8 and one 9, so I could bid '3 8s' or '3 9s'. I'll go with '3 9s' since it's the highest digit I have, making it harder for others to outbid me.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand. Challenging 3 9s is risky—there’s roughly a 78% chance there are at least three 9s among the 40 unseen digits. Instead, I’ll raise the bid. By bidding 5 0s, I increase the quantity from 3 to 5. Given my three 0s, I only need two more among the remaining 40 digits; the probability of that happening is about 92%, which feels safe while also putting pressure on the next players.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have no zeros in my hand. That means all 5 zeros must be among the 40 unknown digits. The expected number of zeros in those is only 4, and the probability of getting at least 5 is under 40%. It’s more likely the bid is false, so I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold three 0s in my hand (04056035). With 32 unknown digits among the other four players, the probability that at least one more 0 exists is over 95%, giving a very safe chance that there are at least four 0s in total. Opening with 4 0s leverages my strong hand while not being so high that it invites an immediate challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 0s' and my hand '11170159', I notice that I have no 0s. However, I have multiple 1s, which could indicate a higher presence of 1s across all players. Since the current bid is on 0s and I need to make a strictly higher bid, I'll consider increasing the quantity or changing the digit to a higher one. Considering the distribution of my hand and the fact that I don't have any 0s, bidding on a higher digit seems more reasonable. Given that the maximum quantity for any digit is 40 and we are already at a total of 40 digits remaining, making an extremely high bid might not be wise. A moderate increase, either in quantity or digit, seems like a safer approach. Since I have three 1s, this gives me some confidence in the presence of 1s, but not enough to significantly raise the quantity. Thus, I'll choose to bid on a higher digit, considering my hand's composition and the need to make a higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 8s, two 6s, one 5, one 0, and one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 4 1s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, an average digit count is 4 (40 / 10 digits). Having three 8s in my hand makes a bid on 8s attractive. Bidding 5 8s is a reasonable step up from 4 1s, increasing both quantity and digit, and is supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Across 40 total digits the average number of 8s is 4. I hold none, so all five 8s would have to come from the remaining 32 unseen digits. Under a uniform distribution that happens roughly 20-25 % of the time, and the bidder would usually need an unusually large concentration of 8s in their own hand (3-4 or more) to feel safe – an event that itself is very rare (~4 %). Given these odds, the bid of 5 8s is more likely a bluff than true. Challenging gives me an estimated ≥75 % chance to win, better than making an uncertain higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round. I have three 8s, two 6s, one 5, one 0, and one 2 in my hand. The most common digits in my hand are 8s (3) and 6s (2). Given that there are 32 total digits, a bid of 4 8s seems reasonable, as it's slightly higher than my hand count and a common digit for me, but not overly aggressive for the first bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, which means there are at least 3 more 8s among the other three players for the bid of '4 8s' to be valid. With 24 digits among the other players, this is quite possible. I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 9, which I can use to make a bid of '4 9s' (same quantity, higher digit). This is a safe incremental raise that doesn't overcommit based on my limited information about others' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I hold three 0s. To overbid the current 4 9s I must raise the quantity. Bidding 5 0s uses the digit I’m strongest in. With 24 unseen digits among the other three players, the chance that at least two additional 0s exist is comfortably high (about 70%). Challenging 4 9s is riskier since I have no 9s and it is quite plausible that the other players together have four or more 9s. Therefore, raising to 5 0s is the better move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 5 0s and considering the total digits remaining is 32, I have to make a decision based on the likelihood of higher bids being true. My hand contains 11170159, which doesn't give me a strong indication for bidding on any specific high digit due to its composition mainly of 1s and a single occurrence of other digits. However, since I need to bid higher than 5 0s, I must consider what could realistically be higher. Given the presence of multiple 1s in my hand and the fact that bidding on 1s could be reasonable considering the distribution might favor lower digits due to the nature of the game and the bids made so far, I could consider bidding on 1s. Yet, the challenge made by Player 3 on 5 0s and the outcome showing 6 zeros exist, suggests zeros are more plentiful than one might initially guess. This makes bidding on a higher quantity of a low digit or the same quantity with a higher digit a risky maneuver without more information. Since my hand doesn't strongly support a higher bid on any specific digit without overestimating, and given the unpredictability of the game, challenging the current bid seems like a viable option, especially considering the potential for overbidding. However, without a clear indication that the current bid of 5 0s is unlikely (given the previous challenge on a similar bid resulted in the bidder winning), and acknowledging the strategic depth of Liar's Poker which involves bluffing and strategic bidding, making an informed decision requires weighing the potential risks and rewards. The fact that the total count of zeros was higher than expected in the previous round suggests that players might have more zeros than initially thought, making a challenge on 5 0s potentially risky. Thus, considering the need to make a higher bid and the composition of my hand, a reasonable approach would be to increase the quantity or digit, taking into account the game's progression and the information gleaned from previous bids and challenges.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. The current bid is 6 1s. With 4 players and 32 total digits, the average count for any digit is 3.2. A bid of 6 1s is higher than average, but not excessively so, especially if Player 4 has several 1s. However, I have three 8s, which is a strong hand for that digit. Bidding 7 8s would be a significant jump in quantity but is supported by my hand. Bidding 6 8s is a safer increase, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit. Given the history of challenges and the fact that Player 4's bid is plausible, challenging is risky. Bidding 6 8s is a reasonable move based on my hand and the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to evaluate if 6 8s is a reasonable bid. In my hand, I have one 8. This means there would need to be 5 more 8s among the other three players' hands. That's an average of 1.67 8s per player, which is possible but somewhat high. Looking at the bidding history, Player 5 has bid on 8s twice now (first 5 8s in the previous round, which was challenged and proven correct, and now 6 8s). This suggests Player 5 likely has multiple 8s in their hand. Given that I have one 8, and Player 5 probably has 2-3 8s based on their bidding pattern, it's plausible that the remaining players have 2-3 more 8s between them. I could challenge, but it seems risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding on 9s gives me some confidence. I'll bid 7 0s, increasing the quantity while switching to a digit I know exists in my hand (I have one 0).

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I see 3 zeros in my own 8-digit hand. For Player 1’s bid of 7 zeros to be true, there must be at least 4 zeros among the remaining 24 unseen digits. If digits are roughly uniform, the probability of 4 or more zeros in 24 digits is a little over 20%, meaning the bid fails about 4 times in 5. That’s a good advantage for me. Player 1 had been bidding other digits earlier, so they may be bluffing rather than holding an unusually large number of zeros. Challenging now gives me the best chance to eliminate them without risking making an even riskier overbid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 0s' and my hand '11170159', I notice I don't have any zeros. Considering the total digits remaining is 24 and we have 3 active players, each with 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 24. Since the current bid is for 4 zeros, and given that I have no zeros in my hand, I must consider the likelihood of this bid being true. With 24 digits in total and my hand not contributing any zeros, it's possible but not highly likely that there are 4 zeros among the other players' hands. However, without concrete evidence or a clear indication that the bid is unlikely, and considering the rules that allow for a challenge only if I'm certain or have a strong reason to doubt, my best move is to make a strategic bid that is higher and based on my hand's composition. Since my hand contains multiple '1's, I can attempt to bid on '1's, aiming for a quantity that seems plausible given the total number of digits and the fact that I hold a significant portion of '1's. Thus, bidding on '1's seems like a reasonable strategy, considering I have three '1's in my hand, which already contributes significantly to the total count of '1's.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand. That means all six 8s claimed in the bid would have to come from the 16 digits held by Players 4 and 5. Under a uniform distribution the expected number of 8s in those 16 digits is about 1.6, and the probability of there being 6 or more is roughly 0.2%. Even when there were 40 digits in play last round there were only 5 actual 8s. With just 24 digits total, a claim of 6 8s is extraordinarily unlikely, so challenging is the safest move.

Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 2 0s and I have the hand 11170159, I notice there are no 0s in my hand. However, I do have multiple 1s. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Considering my hand and the fact that we are down to 16 total digits, bidding on a digit I have multiple of seems strategic. I have three 1s, which suggests that bidding on 1s could be a good move, especially since the current bid is on 0s and I don't have any 0s to contribute to that count.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold three 0s (0,0,0). Player 4 has a history of confidently bidding 1s, so challenging their current bid of 3 1s is dangerous—they probably do have at least three 1s. Instead, I should raise using the digit I’m strongest in. By bidding 4 0s I increase the quantity, satisfying the ‘higher bid’ rule. I only need Player 4 to have a single 0 to make the bid true; with eight unknown digits on their side this occurs more than half the time. Thus the risk of being caught bluffing is lower than the risk of challenging the 1s bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 0s' and my hand '11170159', I notice that I have no zeros. Considering the total digits remaining is 16 and we are down to 2 players, each having 8 digits, the bid of '4 0s' seems plausible but not extremely likely since I have none. However, given that the highest digit I have in abundance is '1' and I already have a significant number of '1s', bidding higher on '1s' might not be the best strategy since the opponent might have a similar or higher count of '1s'. Since the current bid is '4 0s', to make a higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Given my hand, bidding on a higher digit than '0' without increasing the quantity too much seems like a safer bet. However, I must consider what digits are likely to appear in significant quantities. Given the game's progression and the fact that '1' has appeared frequently in bids, and considering my own hand which contains multiple '1s', it might be a safer bet to challenge the current bid of '4 0s' since I have no '0s' and the game is in its late stages with fewer digits remaining.
