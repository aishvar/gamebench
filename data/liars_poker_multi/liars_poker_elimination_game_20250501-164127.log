Player 0 Reasoning: As the starting player, I need to make the opening bid. My hand contains three 7s and two 4s. Starting with a conservative and statistically reasonable bid, I will open with '2 7s', leveraging the fact that I have three 7s myself, making it likely that this bid is safe.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. With 40 unknown digits and a uniform distribution, the expected number of 7s among them is 4, so the probability of seeing at least one more 7 (to reach 3 total) is about 98.5%. Bidding 3 7s is the smallest quantity increase and is highly likely to hold.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, the average number of any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8.  A bid of 3 7s is plausible, but I have no 7s to support a higher bid on 7s. I need to either bid a higher quantity of 7s (unlikely given my hand) or bid on a different digit. I have two 2s, one 0, one 3, two 9s, and two 4s. Bidding on 2s, 9s, or 4s seems more strategic. A bid of 4 2s is a valid higher bid and is plausible given I have two 2s and there are 5 other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 2. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total), and Player 2 bidding 4 2s, this means there need to be 3 more 2s among the other 40 digits I can't see. This is quite possible. Based on my hand, I know there's at least one 2, and the probability of having 3 more 2s in 40 remaining digits is reasonable. I should make a higher bid. Since I have one 7 in my hand and two players previously bid on 7s (suggesting there are several 7s in play), bidding 4 7s would be a strategic move - it maintains the same quantity but uses a higher digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid of 4 7s is likely to be met since the expected total for any digit across all players is 4.8. Since I have no 7s in my hand, challenging would be risky. Bidding 4 8s (same quantity but higher digit) leverages my single 8 and aligns with the statistical likelihood of 8s being at least as common as the average digit. This maintains pressure without overcommitting to a higher quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current game state and decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Looking at my hand (51396352), I have one 8. The current bid is '4 8s', meaning Player 4 believes there are at least 4 eights among all players. With 6 active players having 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. If the 8s are randomly distributed, we'd expect about 4.8 eights total (48 Ã— 1/10). Since I have one 8 in my hand, that means there would need to be at least 3 more 8s among the other players' hands to make the current bid valid. This is certainly possible. I could bid higher, but I don't have many 9s in my hand (just one), so bidding '4 9s' would be risky. I could bid '5 0s', '5 1s', '5 2s', '5 3s', '5 5s', or '5 6s' based on what I have in my hand. Since I have two 5s in my hand, bidding '5 5s' seems reasonable - I already account for 2 of them, and need only 3 more among 40 remaining digits from other players.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s, two 4s, two 5s, one 1, and one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 5 5s. With 6 players and 48 digits, the average for any digit is about 4.8, so 5 of a digit is plausible. I personally hold two 5s, making it likely there are at least three more among the remaining 40 digits. Challenging now would be risky. To make a legal bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since I have two 7s, bidding 5 7s is reasonable, as 7s have already seen interest and I have a strong hand for them.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I hold one 8, and among the 40 unknown digits the expected count of 8s is 4 (Binomial(40,0.1)), giving about a 58% chance to meet a total of 5 8s (1 in my hand + 4 unknown). Bidding 5 8s is the minimal raise and remains plausible.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have no 8s in my hand.  A bid of 5 8s is quite high with 6 players and 48 total digits. The average number of any digit is 4.8 (48/10). While it's possible there are five 8s, the probability isn't overwhelmingly high, and I have no support for it.  Considering the bidding history and my lack of the required digit, challenging seems like a reasonable strategy.

Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 2. Since there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total), and Player 2 bid '2 2s', this seems like a very conservative bid. Given the previous round's aggressive bidding, and that I have several higher digits (6,7,8) in my hand, I can safely raise to '2 3s' to move the bidding forward while keeping the quantity manageable.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 2 3s. Bidding 2 5s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages my known 5s to create a statistically safer claim, as the total count of 5s across all players must be at least 2 (which my hand alone satisfies). This reduces the risk of being challenged successfully.

Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (51396352), I have one 5. The current bid is '2 5s', suggesting there should be at least 2 fives among all players. Since I have 1 five in my hand, I need to consider whether there's likely at least one more 5 among the other players. With 5 players each having 8 digits, the probability of at least one more 5 existing is quite high. I could challenge, but it's risky given the low bid quantity. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have three 3s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 3s. I could bid '2 6s', but I don't have any 6s in my hand. I'll bid '3 3s' since I already have 3 of them myself, making this a very safe bid that increases the quantity.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 74721745, which contains three 7s and two 4s. The current bid is 3 3s. Since I have no 3s, I am not confident in raising the bid on 3s. However, I have three 7s, and there are 32 unknown digits among four other players, so it is likely there is at least one more 7 among them. Therefore, I will bid 4 7s, increasing both the quantity and switching to a digit I hold strongly.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have no 7s in my hand (22039494). With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. A bid of 4 7s isn't inherently unreasonable, but without any 7s myself, I'd need to believe the other players collectively hold four or more 7s. Given the history, players seem to be escalating bids fairly quickly. I could bid 5 of any digit, but that feels risky without supporting digits in my hand. I could also bid 4 of a higher digit, like 4 8s or 4 9s. I have two 9s and two 2s. Bidding 4 9s seems plausible as I have two, and it's a higher digit than 7. Bidding 4 2s is also possible as I have two, but 2 is a lower digit. Bidding 4 9s is a stronger bid based on my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (27348610), I only have zero 9s. With 5 players having 8 digits each (40 total), and Player 2 claiming there are at least 4 nines, this seems unlikely. Even if every other player had one 9 each (which is already a stretch), that would only be 4 nines total. Given I know for certain there are zero 9s in my hand, and the probability of finding 4 nines in the remaining 32 digits (40-8) is quite low, challenging is the safer option than trying to make a higher bid of 5 of any digit.

With 4 active players having 8 digits each, there are 32 total digits in play. For there to be at least 4 fives, the other players would need to have at least 3 more fives among them. This is certainly possible. I have two 6s in my hand, so I could bid '4 6s', which would be a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Another option is to increase the quantity to 5, but that would be risky since I only know about one 5 for certain.

With 32 digits in play and each digit having a 1/10 chance of appearing, the expected count of any specific digit is about 3.2. The bid of 4 6s is slightly above expectation, but not unreasonable. However, since I have zero 6s, the probability that the other three players collectively have at least 4 is quite low (they would need to average more than 1.3 each). Given the prior bids have not focused on 6s and no one has shown particular interest in that digit, I believe this is a good spot to challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to open the bidding with no previous bids. My hand is 74721745, which contains three 7s and two 4s. Opening with a bid that reflects the strength of my hand is optimal. Bidding 2 7s is strong since I hold three 7s myself, making it very safe and putting pressure on my opponent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains zero 7s. The current bid is 2 7s. With only 16 total digits, the probability of there being at least two 7s across both hands is not extremely high, but it's not impossible. However, given my lack of 7s, increasing the bid on 7s would be risky. I have two 2s, two 4s, two 9s, zero 0s, zero 3s. Bidding 3 2s or 3 4s or 3 9s are all valid higher bids based on my hand. Bidding 3 2s seems like a reasonable increase based on my hand strength in 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 74721745, which contains zero 2s. The current bid is 3 2s. Since I have none, all three 2s would have to be in Player 2's hand. With only 8 digits in their hand, the probability that they have exactly three or more 2s is quite low. Given the risk for Player 2 to make this bid, it is likely a bluff or a risky play. Challenging here is the optimal move.
