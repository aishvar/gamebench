Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains three 0s. Since there's no current bid, I can start with a bid based on my own digits. Bidding 3 0s reflects the count in my hand and sets a reasonable starting point for the game.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 0, bidding a higher digit seems more reasonable. I will bid 3 1s, increasing the digit while matching the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have 2 1s in my hand. I can make a valid bid by increasing the quantity or digit. Since I have no 2s or higher, I'll increase the quantity to 4 and keep the digit the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I hold three 9s in my hand. Since the current bid of 4 1s requires at least four 1s across all players (none of which are in my hand), challenging risks elimination if the total 1s is average (~4.8 expected). Instead, leveraging my three 9s, bidding 4 9s (same quantity but higher digit) is a strategic escalation, as the actual count of 9s is likely â‰¥4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 4 9s, which means there would need to be at least 3 more 9s among the other 5 players (40 digits). Given the low probability of this and the aggressive jump to 9s from 1s, it's likely a bluff. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. Given the previous round's actual count of 7 nines (with one player eliminated), it's plausible there are still enough 9s across the remaining 5 players to support a bid of 4. Starting with this bid leverages my strong position in 9s and pressures opponents early.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Given that Player 4 was eliminated after challenging 4 9s and the bidder won (meaning there were at least 4 9s), it's risky to challenge. I need to make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit to 5 seems more reasonable than trying to bid a higher quantity. Bidding 5 0s is a safe option, as 0s are often underrepresented. While I don't have any 0s, it's less likely someone has a huge number of them.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have three 0s in my hand. With 40 total digits across 5 players, the actual count of 0s could be as low as 3 (if others have none) or higher. Challenging this bid tests whether the total count is at least 5. If the actual count is less than 5, I win; otherwise, the bidder wins. Given the uncertainty and my hand's 0s, challenging is a logical risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is None. I have one 0, one 1, one 2, two 6s, one 7, one 8, and one 9 in my hand. Since it's the start of the round, I can bid reasonably. Bidding 1 0s is a safe start, as I have one 0. Increasing the digit seems better than increasing the quantity at this stage to gauge other players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '1 0s' made by Player 5. I have one 0 in my hand. Given that there are 3 other active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total possible count for 0s could be up to 32. However, bidding '2 0s' seems reasonable as it accounts for my 0 and potentially one more among the other players. Since my goal is to make a strictly higher bid, I will bid '2 0s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid since it's the same quantity but a higher digit. This bid leverages my own knowledge of having multiple 9s, making the bid truthful and strategic.

Player 3 bids: 3 9s

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 4 9s would be risky as it relies on other players having multiple 9s. Bidding 4 0s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is reasonable given the previous bids focused on 0s. However, considering the history, 0s have been frequently bid on and challenged, making a higher bid on them potentially dangerous. I have a 6 and a 7 in my hand. Bidding 4 7s is a valid and reasonable bid, increasing both quantity and digit. It's less likely to be challenged than a bid on 0 or 9.

Player 5 bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 5. I have 8 secret digits: 81840078. I see that I have one 7 and two 0s, and other players have shown interest in 0s and 9s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 32 total digits remaining, bidding a high quantity seems risky without more information. However, I can see that 4 7s might be plausible given that I have one 7 and there are 3 other players. I also note that bidding higher than 4 7s requires either a higher quantity or a higher digit. Since I do not have many high digits, I will challenge the bid of 4 7s to test its validity.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my turn to bid. I have 8 secret digits: 81840078. I can see that I have 3 zeros in my hand. Given that there are 24 total digits remaining across 3 players, bidding 3 0s seems reasonable and a good starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s, which is a low bid. I should increase the digit to something higher based on my hand, but I need to be cautious not to challenge an unlikely bid. I have a 3 in my hand, so I can bid 3 3s, increasing the digit, but I should also consider the total digits remaining and the previous bids to ensure it's not too high.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. Since 9 is higher than 3, bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid than the current 3 3s. This bid is guaranteed to be truthful because the total count of 9s across all players is at least 3 (my own three), making it a safe move.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 3. I have one 9 in my hand. Given that there are only 24 digits in total and three players, the maximum possible count for any digit is 24. The bid of 3 9s seems plausible but not extremely high. I should consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since I have one 9, and assuming the other players might have a few 9s as well, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems risky without more information. However, I notice that I have three 0s, and the bid for 0s was only 3 0s. Bidding 4 0s seems like a reasonable move as it increases the quantity and utilizes the information from my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have 2 0s in my hand. Bidding 4 0s is not possible since the current bid is already 4 0s. I should bid a higher digit, but I don't have any digit that is higher than 0. However, I can challenge the current bid since it's unlikely that there are at least 4 0s in total.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. The current bid of 1 9s is already guaranteed to be true (at least three total 9s). Bidding 3 9s is a safe and aggressive move, forcing Player 2 to either challenge (which would eliminate them) or bid higher. Since the total count is at least three, this bid is valid and pressures Player 2 into a difficult decision.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. The current bid of 4 9s requires at least one additional 9 in Player 2's hand. Given the risk of Player 2 bluffing and the high likelihood of the total count being exactly 3 (if Player 2 has zero 9s), challenging is a calculated risk. Player 2's aggressive bidding pattern could indicate a bluff rather than holding at least one 9.
