Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder with my hand 29010794, I see: one 0, one 1, one 2, one 4, one 7, one 9. A conservative opening bid would be based on what I can see plus a reasonable estimate of what others might have. Since I have one 0, bidding '3 0s' suggests I expect to find just 2 more zeros among the other 40 digits, which is quite reasonable statistically.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have the hand 24038427, which contains two 0s and two 2s, two 4s, and two other digits. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 0s, it's plausible that there are at least 3 0s in total among all players. However, increasing the digit seems more reasonable as it gives a higher bid without asserting a higher quantity. I will bid 3 1s as it's a higher digit than 0.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have two 1s in my hand, which makes the total count of 1s across all hands at most 2 if no other players have 1s. Bidding higher than 3 1s (e.g., 4 1s) is risky because the maximum total is 6 players * 8 digits = 48 digits, but realistically, the total count of 1s is unlikely to reach 4. Alternatively, increasing the digit to 2 and bidding 3 2s would be a safe move since I have no 2s, but it would be a valid higher bid. However, given my hand, the safest move is to challenge the current bid, as it's unlikely that there are at least 4 1s in total.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None' as it's the start of the round and I am Player 1, who starts the bidding. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 24038427, which contains two 2s, one 4s, two 8s, and three other digits. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and the total number of digits. Since there are 40 digits in total and I see two 2s and two 8s, bidding on a relatively common digit with a low quantity seems sensible. I will bid on 8s as there's a good chance others might have 8s as well.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have two 5s and one 8 in my hand. Since the current bid has a quantity of 5, I can try to increase the quantity by 1 to 6, which is a valid move. Alternatively, I can challenge the current bid if I think it's unlikely. However, with 40 total digits remaining, a quantity of 5 is within the realm of possibility, but increasing the digit to a higher value is not feasible with my current hand. Therefore, I will bid 6 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s, and I have zero 8s, so I’m not comfortable challenging on that digit. However, I do hold three 9s (03399952). With 32 unknown digits left in other players’ hands, the expected number of additional 9s is roughly 3, making a total of about 6 9s quite plausible. By raising to the same quantity but a higher digit, I make a legal, stronger bid that leans on the strength of my own hand and puts the pressure on the next player to either out-bid or challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand and with 40 digits total the expected number of 9s is only about 4. A bid of 6 9s is very unlikely (probability under 10%). It’s much better to challenge than to escalate to an even more improbable 7 of any digit.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With 32 total digits and a uniform distribution, the expected count of 8s is about 3.2; with my two, it’s likely there are at least two more among opponents. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable, aggressive opening and using a high digit makes it harder for others to outbid at the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 29010794, I have zero 8s. The current bid of 4 8s means Player 5 is claiming there are at least 4 eights across all 32 digits (4 players × 8 digits each). Given I have no 8s in my hand, this would require the other three players to have an average of more than 1.3 eights each to make this bid valid. While possible, this seems unlikely given the previous round's challenge revealed only 5 nines among 40 digits. The safer play is to challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 4, one 7, one 9, and two times the digit 0. Given that I'm starting the bidding in this round with 3 players (24 total digits), I should make a conservative opening bid. I can see one 0 in my hand, so bidding 3 0s is relatively safe as it's likely there are at least two more 0s among the other 16 digits held by other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have the hand 24038427, which contains one 0 and two 2s, among other digits. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have many 0s, bidding 3 1s seems reasonable as it increases the digit. However, I should also consider the likelihood of other players having 1s. Given that the total count of digits is 24 and there are three players, it's plausible that there are more than three 1s in total. Thus, bidding 4 1s could be a safe and reasonable move, increasing the quantity.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have 1 1 in my hand. Given the relatively low total digits remaining and the current bid, I can try to make a higher bid by increasing the quantity and digit to 4 2s, as I have two 2s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have only one 2. For the bid of '4 2s' to be true, there would need to be three more 2s between the other two players (average of 1.5 per player). While possible, this seems unlikely given that digits are randomly distributed. Looking at the game history, players have been making relatively conservative bids, and 4 2s feels like a stretch. Additionally, my hand contains valuable information about the actual count of 2s, making my challenge more informed. I believe challenging is safer than making a higher bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 3. I have the hand 24038427, which contains two 4s and no 6s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 6s, I suspect the total count of 6s might be low. However, I should still bid if I think it's likely that there are at least 4 of some digit. Given that there are 16 digits in total and I have 8 of them, I can analyze my hand. My hand has a total of 2 fours and 2 twos. A reasonable next bid could be to increase the quantity or digit. Bidding 3 7s or 4 6s are options, but since I don't see any 7s or 6s in my hand, I should be cautious. However, 4 2s seems plausible because I have two 2s. Thus, I will bid 4 2s, increasing the quantity and changing the digit to something I have seen in my hand.

Since there are 16 total digits and I have seen my 2 sixes, there are 14 other digits. Assuming an even distribution, the total count of 6s should be around 1-2. However, Player 3 bid 3 6s previously and then 4 6s, suggesting they might have some 6s. I have 2 sixes, so together we have at least 4 sixes, making 4 6s a plausible bid. To make a higher bid, I can either bid 5 6s or 4 7s. Bidding 5 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. I will bid 5 6s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have the hand 24038427, which contains two 6s. Given that there are 16 digits in total and I have 8 of them, the remaining 8 digits are with Player 3. The total count of 6s must be at least 2 (mine) plus some from Player 3's hand. Bidding 7 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. However, I should also consider the likelihood of Player 3 having more than 4 sixes. Since the total count of 6s is likely to be between 2 and 6, bidding 7 6s may be a bit too high. I should analyze the probability and the risk of being challenged. Given the history, Player 3 has been making reasonable bids. Challenging 6 6s might not be the best option as it's possible Player 3 has some 6s. I will bid 6 7s, increasing the digit as an alternative to increase the quantity.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. My hand is 24038427, which contains two 7s and no 8s or higher digits that could immediately influence a higher bid on 7s or higher. Given that there are 16 digits in total and I have two 7s, it's possible that there are 7 or more 7s in total, but it's a tight margin. Bidding 8 7s seems risky but is a possible next step as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity (7) is not possible since I'm already at 7s. I should consider if 7 7s is likely to be true or if challenging is a viable option. If I challenge and lose, I'll be eliminated. My hand has two 7s, and with 8 digits from Player 3, there's a reasonable chance they have more 7s. Thus, making a slightly higher bid is a safer strategy than challenging directly.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 7s. My hand is 24038427, which contains two 7s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since the maximum possible quantity is 16 and we have 16 digits in total, bidding 10 7s is plausible because it's still below the maximum. However, considering my hand and the fact that Player 3 has already bid 9 7s, it's likely they have a significant number of 7s. I will increase the digit instead, bidding the same quantity but a higher digit is not an option since I'm already at 7s. Thus, I should either challenge or increase the quantity. Given that I have two 7s and there are 8 digits with Player 3, it's possible they have a substantial number of 7s, making 9 7s a potentially valid bid. However, considering the history and the fact that I'm not sure about the exact distribution, I will challenge the bid as it seems high given the total count of digits is 16.
