Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand. As the first bidder, bidding 3 1s is safe because my hand alone guarantees at least three 1s exist, minimizing risk of an early challenge. This sets a conservative starting point for the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. I can safely bid 3 1s to match the current bid, but I'll instead bid one more 1, increasing the quantity to 4. This is a reasonable move since I have one 1 and there are 48 digits remaining, which should allow for multiple players to have at least one 1.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. My hand contains zero 1s, which makes challenging risky as the bid quantity (4) is close to the average expected count (4.8 total, or 4 among the other players). My hand contains two 2s. Bidding 4 2s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is well supported by my hand, requiring only two additional 2s among the other 40 digits. This seems like a safe and reasonable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current game state. The current bid is '4 2s'. Looking at my hand (52539624), I have one 2. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, for a total of 48 digits. For there to be at least 4 twos, I would need the other players to have at least 3 more twos among them, which is quite reasonable. Given that I have one 2 myself, I believe the current bid is likely valid. I could challenge, but it seems risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, which gives me confidence to bid on 5s. I could bid '4 3s', '4 4s', '4 5s', or even '5 2s' to increase the quantity. I'll bid '5 5s' to both increase the quantity and use a digit I have multiple of in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s by Player 3. Since I have the digits 7, 9, 2, 6, 7, 4, 1, 7, I have three 7s, one 9, one 2, one 6, one 4, and one 1. The total number of 5s across all hands is uncertain, but given my hand, I have no 5s. The previous bids have increased the quantity of 1s and 2s, but not 5s. The total number of 5s could be low, but challenging might be risky if the total is at least five. To be safe and to increase the bid, I should raise the quantity or digit. Since I have no 5s, I can't confidently bid higher than 5 5s, so I will increase the digit to 6s with the same quantity, which is a valid move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: In my hand, I only have 0 sixes. The current bid claims there are at least 5 sixes among all players. With 6 players having 8 digits each, this is possible, but given that I have none and the bid has escalated quickly to 5 sixes, it seems unlikely. Players might be bluffing since the quantity jumped from 4 to 5. While I could bid 5 7s or 6 of something lower, challenging seems safer given I can see zero 6s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round, I should start conservatively. Looking at my hand (79746209), I have one 7 and can reasonably expect a few more among other players. With 5 players having 8 digits each (40 total), starting with '3 7s' is a safe opening bid - it's not too aggressive but still based on what I can see in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 7s in my hand (46101314), so the 3 7s bid relies entirely on other players. With 32 unknown digits across 4 players, 3+ 7s is plausible but uncertain. Bidding higher is safer than challenging prematurely. I'll bluff with 3 8s (same quantity, higher digit) since I have no 8s either, but this forces the next player to take action without risking immediate elimination.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. With 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. A bid of 4 8s is the average, making a challenge risky as the actual count could easily be 4 or more. I have two 2s in my hand. Bidding 5 2s is a valid higher bid (quantity 5 > quantity 4) and is plausible. I have 2 of the required 5, meaning I only need 3 more 2s from the remaining 32 digits held by other players. This is a statistically reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (52539624), I have one 2 in it. The current bid is 5 2s across all players. With 5 active players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. For there to be at least 5 2s, the other players would need to have at least 4 more 2s among them. This is certainly possible. I could make a higher bid, but I don't have strong information about other digits. I notice I have two 5s in my hand, which gives me some confidence to bid on 5s. I'll bid 5 5s, which is valid because it maintains the same quantity but increases the digit value from 2 to 5.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (79746209), I have zero 5s. The current bid claims there are 5 5s among all players. With 40 total digits and 5 players, even distribution would suggest about 8 of each digit. Since I have none, and 5s aren't particularly common, having 5 of them among the other 32 digits seems unlikely. Additionally, Player 3's bid pattern doesn't show strong confidence (jumping to match the previous quantity). This makes the bid of '5 5s' suspicious enough to challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have 8 digits in my hand (79746209). Since this is a fresh round with 32 total digits and 4 players, a conservative opening bid would be wise. Looking at my hand, I have one 7, which suggests starting with a low quantity of a digit I can verify. A bid of '3 7s' would be reasonable - I know I have one, and there's a good chance of finding two more among the other 24 digits held by other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand. With only three other players holding 24 digits, the expected number of 7s is 2.4, and the probability of fewer than 3 is approximately 56.5%. Since Player 5 made a similar bid of 3 7s in the previous round with more players, and given the reduced player count, challenging now is slightly favorable.

Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (79746209), I have one 7. Since I've successfully bid 3 7s before and won, suggesting other players also have 7s, it's a safe starting bid. However, I'll start with a lower quantity of 2 7s to leave room for escalation and not risk an early challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains zero 7s. The current bid is 3 7s. For this bid to be true, all three or more 7s must be present in the other two players' hands (16 digits total). The probability of finding three or more 7s in 16 random digits is approximately 21.2%. This low probability suggests the bid is likely false.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand (79746209). With only 16 total digits between us and Player 1's bid of 2 8s, this is a reasonable bid since it only claims there are 2 total. Given that I have one 8, it's quite possible Player 1 has at least one 8 as well. I could bid higher, but since I don't have strong evidence of more 8s or other digits in high quantities, it's safer to challenge this reasonable bid. I'll make a higher bid of '2 9s' since I have one 9 in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s made by Player 5. I have no 9s in my hand, but I can try to make a higher bid by increasing the digit. Since I have a 7 in my hand, I can bid 3 7s, which is higher than the current bid and a reasonable increase based on my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have only one 7 in my hand (79746209). With only 16 total digits in play between us, and Player 1 claiming there are at least 3 sevens, this means they would need to have at least 2 sevens in their hand. While not impossible, this seems unlikely given the previous bidding patterns and my knowledge of my own hand. Since I can see all the 7s in my hand (just one), and they're claiming 3 total, this is a good opportunity to challenge.
