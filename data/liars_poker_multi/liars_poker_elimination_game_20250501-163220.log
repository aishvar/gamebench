Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning I can make any initial bid. I have 3 ones in my hand. Since there are 6 players and 8 digits per player, there are 48 digits in total. Starting with a low but reasonable bid seems wise. I will start with 'BID: 3 1s' as it reflects my hand and leaves room for others to bid or challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '1' in my hand, but the current bid is 3 '1s'. Since I have a '2' in my hand, bidding 3 '2s' is a valid higher bid with the same quantity but higher digit. This leverages my known cards without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. Bidding 3 3s is a valid and conservative increase, as it maintains the quantity but increases the digit. Bidding higher quantities seems risky without knowing the other players' hands. I could also challenge, but 3 2s doesn't seem *completely* unreasonable given the total number of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 30459896. I have one 3 and two 9s. The current bid is 3 3s. I can increase the digit to 4s, 5s, 6s, 8s, or 9s while keeping the quantity at 3, or I can increase the quantity. Given I have two 9s, bidding 3 9s seems like a reasonable and safe increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand of 78296303, I have zero 9s. The current bid of '3 9s' means Player 3 is claiming there are at least 3 nines among all 48 digits. While this is possible, it would require at least 3 nines to be distributed among the other 5 players' 40 digits, since I have none. Given that the bidding has been conservative so far (all bids of quantity 3), and I can see that I have no 9s to contribute, I'll challenge this bid as it seems unlikely there are 3 or more 9s total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I am the first to bid in this round. My hand is 30459896. I have two 9s, one 3, one 0, one 4, one 5, one 8, and one 6. Since I have two 9s and the previous round's challenge on 3 9s revealed 4 9s among 6 players (48 digits), it's reasonable to assume there are still a decent number of 9s among the remaining 5 players (40 digits). Bidding 3 9s is a safe starting bid based on my hand and the previous round's outcome.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 4s and one 7 in my hand, but no 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, which was just proven correct in the previous round (actual count was 4). Since I don't have any 9s, it's possible that other players have multiple 9s. However, bidding higher would require either increasing the quantity or the digit. Given that 9 is already the highest digit, I can only increase the quantity. Bidding 4 9s seems risky but possible, given the previous count. Alternatively, I could challenge, but since the last challenge failed, I'll make a conservative bid.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 5. I have 8 secret digits: 7, 3, 4, 0, 5, 1, 4, 1. I see that I have two 1s, one 4, and no 9s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40 and there are 40 total digits remaining, a bid of 4 9s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid. Since my hand does not have any 9s, I will focus on bidding a different digit. I have two 4s and two 1s. Bidding 3 4s seems reasonable as it's higher than 4 9s in terms of digit value and I have a basis for this bid with my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 5. I have 8 secret digits: 7, 3, 4, 0, 5, 1, 4, 1. I see that I have two 4s and one 1, but no 9s. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are 40 digits in total. The bid of 4 9s seems unlikely because if each player had one 9, that would account for 5 9s. However, I need to consider my own hand and the possibility of others having 9s. I will calculate the feasibility of 4 9s existing and consider my next move based on my hand and potential higher bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have two 0s in my hand, but bidding 5 1s is a valid higher bid since the digit is higher. This maintains the same quantity (5) but increases the digit, adhering to the rules. Challenging would risk losing if the actual count of 0s is 5 or more, which is plausible given the total digits remaining.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Bidding 6 1s is a logical next step, as it increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same. This is a reasonable bid given the information available and my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have zero 1s in my hand. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4. A bid of 6 1s is above average. Given I have none, it's unlikely there are 6 1s in total. Challenging seems like a reasonable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I am the first to bid in this round. My hand is 30459896. I have two 9s and one of each other digit (0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8). With 4 players and 8 digits each, the average count for any digit is 32 / 10 = 3.2.  Bidding based on my strongest digit (9s) seems reasonable. I have two 9s, so bidding 3 9s is a safe starting bid, slightly above the average and reflecting my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 4s and two 7s in my hand, but no 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, which was just made by Player 3. Given that there are 32 digits remaining and only 4 players, it's possible that there are at least 3 9s in total, especially since a previous challenge on 3 9s revealed 4 9s. However, I don't have any 9s, so I'm skeptical. I think it's better to challenge this bid rather than make a higher bid that I can't support.

Player 3 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round. I have two 9s in my hand. A conservative starting bid is usually 3 of a digit you have at least one of. Given I have two 9s, bidding 3 9s is a safe and reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 3. I have the digits 7, 3, 4, 0, 5, 1, 4, and 1 in my hand. I see that there are 24 total digits remaining across 3 players, which means each player has 8 digits. I count one 9 in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and there are only 3 players left, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. I will bid 4 1s as I have multiple 1s and it's a higher quantity than 3.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 30459896. I have one 0, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 8, and two 9s. The current bid is 2 0s. I know there is at least one 0 (in my hand). Player 1 has 8 digits. It's plausible Player 1 has at least one 0 as well, making 2 0s a reasonable bid. However, with 16 total digits, the probability of having two 0s is not extremely high. I have two 9s, which is a strong hand for 9s. I can bid 3 9s, which is a higher quantity than the current bid and uses my strongest digit. This seems safer than challenging 2 0s, as Player 1 might indeed have a 0.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which requires at least three 9s. Since I have one 9 and Player 3's hand is unknown, the actual count might be 3. However, bidding 4 0s increases the quantity and leverages my existing 0s, making it a reasonable higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. Player 1's current bid is 4 0s. With only 16 total digits, a bid of 4 0s means Player 1 is claiming they have at least three 0s in their hand (since I have one). While possible, it's not overwhelmingly likely. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 5 9s would be a significant jump and might be too risky. Given my hand and the current bid, challenging 4 0s seems like a reasonable move as it's a relatively high bid for the current number of remaining digits, and I only have one of that digit myself.
