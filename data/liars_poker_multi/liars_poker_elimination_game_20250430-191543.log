Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning I can make any initial bid. I have 8 digits in my hand: 8, 8, 2, 5, 5, 4, 1, 5. I see that I have three 5s, which is a relatively high count for a single digit. Starting with a bid of '3 5s' seems reasonable and allows me to set a baseline for the round.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand (from 16195234). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Increasing the quantity to 4 5s seems reasonable given that there are 6 players and the total number of digits is 48, making it plausible that there are at least 4 fives. However, bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity is also a viable strategy. I will choose to bid 3 6s as it is a higher bid than 3 5s and I have one 6 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 6s, so challenging 3 6s is risky given the expected ~4.8 sixes in 48 cards. I hold four 9s in my hand, so bidding 4 9s is a valid raise over 3 6s and guaranteed by my own cards.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. With 48 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 4.8. I have one 9, meaning 3 more are needed from the other 40 digits (5 players). This is plausible, so challenging seems risky. I need to make a higher bid, which must be at least 5 0s. Looking at my hand (65698206), I have three 6s. Bidding 5 6s requires only 2 more 6s among the remaining 40 digits. This is statistically very likely (expected number of 6s in the other 40 digits is 4). Additionally, Player 1 previously bid 3 6s, suggesting they might hold some 6s, further increasing the probability that 5 6s exist in total. This makes 5 6s a strong and relatively safe bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 3. I have only one 6 in my hand (digit 6 appears once). Bidding 6 6s would be impossible for me, and the total remaining digits are 48, so a bid of 6 6s is very unlikely. The previous bid is already quite high, and challenging now seems reasonable given my limited number of 6s and the total digits available.

Player 4 Reasoning: The previous bid was 'Player 3 bid 5 6s' which was challenged and found to be false since the actual count was 4. Now, Player 4 starts the new round with no current bid. I need to make an initial bid. My hand contains the digits 4, 9, 5, 3, 9, 1, 7, 9. Counting my 9s, I have three 9s. To be safe, I can bid 3 9s, which is consistent with my hand. Alternatively, I could bid 4 5s if I think I have enough 5s, but I only have one 5. Bidding 3 9s seems the most reasonable initial bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (82477220), I have no 9s. The current bid of '3 9s' by Player 4 means they're claiming there are at least 3 nines across all 40 digits. While this is possible, I can see that there are zero 9s in my 8 digits, meaning all 3 claimed 9s would need to be distributed among the other 4 players (32 digits). More importantly, I see I have three 2s in my hand. I can make a safe bid of '3 2s' since I can verify this quantity just from my own hand, and it's a valid bid since same quantity (3) but lower digit is allowed.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 2/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand. The current bid of 3 9s is relatively low (only needs 3 out of 40 digits). Even without any 9s in my hand, it's quite possible that 3 9s exist among the other 32 digits held by other players. Making a higher bid would be risky since I don't have strong digit counts in my hand. The safest play is to bid a slightly higher quantity with a lower digit. I have three 2s in my hand, so bidding 4 2s is reasonable and safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is '4 2s' made by Player 5. I have 8 secret digits: 88255415. I see that I have two 2s in my hand. Considering there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are 40 digits in total. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Given that the current bid is '4 2s', I need to make a higher bid or challenge. I can see that bidding '5 2s' would be a valid higher bid since it increases the quantity. However, I should also consider if challenging is a better option based on the likelihood of the current bid being true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have one 2 in my hand (16195234). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 40 total digits and 5 players remaining, a bid of 5 2s suggests a relatively high count of 2s. I see that my hand contains one 2. Considering the total count, bidding 6 2s might be too high unless other players have a lot of 2s. However, bidding 5 3s is a safer option as it increases the digit. I will bid 5 3s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have four 9s in my hand and only need one more 9 among the remaining 32 digits to make 5 9s. The probability of at least one more 9 is about 96.6%, making this a very safe raise.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s, which implies there are at least five 9s across all hands. I have only one 9 in my hand. The maximum total 9s possible is 5 (my one plus potentially four from others), but since the previous bid already claims 5 9s, it's unlikely that the total is actually 5 or more. Challenging seems prudent, as the bid is probably overstated.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold four 9s in my hand. Bidding 4 9s is the highest digit at quantity 4, so the count is guaranteed to be at least 4 and cannot be successfully challenged. This puts pressure on opponents to raise to 5 or lose if they challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: In my hand, I have zero 9s. The current bid claims there are 4 9s total among 32 digits (8 per player, 4 players). Player 2 has now bid on 9s twice, first claiming 5 9s (which was true - there were 8!) and now 4 9s. Given their confidence and history with 9s, plus the fact that they likely have multiple 9s themselves to make such bids, their claim of 4 9s is probably valid. I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (82477220), I have three 2s, which gives me confidence to bid 5 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s made by Player 5. I have 8 secret digits: 88255415. I count one 2 and several other digits. Given that there are 4 active players and each has 8 digits, there are 32 digits in total. The bid of 5 2s seems high but not impossible. However, I notice I have two 8s, and bidding on a higher digit with a reasonable quantity could be strategic. I also consider the risk of challenging, but without exact counts, I must make an educated guess. Bidding 4 8s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and uses information from my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s made by Player 5. I have a total of 8 digits in my hand: 88255415. I count 1 '2' in my hand. Given that there are 3 other active players and a total of 32 digits remaining, bidding 6 2s seems risky but possible if other players have multiple 2s. However, I can see that bidding 6 3s or higher quantity with a different digit might be more strategic. I have 2 '3's, 1 '5', and other digits that could contribute to a higher bid. Bidding 6 3s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. My hand is 16195234, which contains one 3. So, I have 1 '3'. The total count of 3s across all players must be at least 6 (my 1 plus at least 5 more from other players). I can either challenge or make a higher bid. A higher bid must be either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. I can bid 7 3s or 6 4s or higher. Given that there are 32 total digits and my hand has one 3, it seems plausible that there could be around 6 3s in total, so challenging might be risky. However, increasing the quantity to 7 3s seems reasonable as it is a relatively small increase and still within a possible range given the total number of digits.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have only one 3 in my hand. There are 31 unknown digits, so even if digits are uniformly distributed (10% chance per digit), the expected number of additional 3s is about 3.1. The probability of seeing at least 6 more 3s (to make the total ≥7) is under 10%. A bid of 7 3s is extremely unlikely, so I should call the bluff and challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (82477220), I have zero 9s. The current bid of 4 9s by Player 2 means they're claiming there are at least 4 nines among all 24 digits (8 digits per player × 3 players). Player 2 has shown a pattern of bidding on 9s in previous rounds, and notably won a challenge when they bid 5 9s earlier (when there were more players). Given I have no 9s in my hand, and they've consistently bid on 9s, they likely have some. While it's possible they have enough 9s to make this bid valid, I could make a safer bid of 5 2s since I have two 2s in my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is '5 2s' made by Player 5. I have the hand 88255415, which contains two 2s. Given that there are only 24 digits in total and three players, the maximum possible count for any digit is 24. The bid of '5 2s' seems high but not impossible. However, I can try to make a higher bid. I will count my digits to see if I can make a valid higher bid. My hand contains one 8, two 2s, one 5, one 4, one 1, and two 6s, and one 3. I can bid higher than '5 2s' by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 2s and there are two other players, I will bid '6 2s' as it seems plausible and higher than the current bid.
