Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains three 9s. Since there's no current bid, starting with a bid that reflects my highest count (3 9s) is logical. This establishes a baseline for others to challenge or build upon.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and with 6 players having 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. For there to be 3 9s, other players would need to have them all. While possible, I can make a safer bid by using my own hand knowledge. I see I have one 5, so I can confidently bid '4 5s' - it's likely there are at least 3 more 5s among the other 40 digits I can't see.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have five 4s in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s. Bidding 5 4s increases the quantity while maintaining a digit I have multiple of, ensuring the bid is likely true. Challenging risks elimination if others hold sufficient 5s, which is uncertain. A bid of 5 4s is both valid and strategically defensible.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have zero 4s in my hand. Across the 48 digits the expected count of 4s is about 4.8, and given my 0 the unknown 40 digits would need â‰¥5 4s with only ~40% probability. The bid of 5 4s is therefore unlikely and should be challenged.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have five 4s in my hand. Starting the bid with 6 4s is reasonable because I already have five, and there's a high likelihood there's at least one more 4 in the remaining 32 digits (40 total - 8 mine). This bid balances confidence in my hand with plausible total distribution.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 65478293, which contains two 4s. The current bid is 6 4s by Player 2, and with 5 players each having 8 digits, there are 40 total digits in play. Since I have 2 of the 4s, there need to be at least 4 more 4s among the other 32 digits for the bid to hold. The probability of this is uncertain but not extremely low, as 4s could be distributed across the other players. In the previous round, the actual count of 4s was 7 when the bid was 5 4s, suggesting there might still be a reasonable number of 4s in play despite the elimination of one player. However, increasing the bid to 6 4s might be pushing it, but I don't feel confident enough to challenge yet since it's plausible. I will make a higher bid of 6 5s, as I also have two 5s in my hand, making it a safer incremental increase in digit while maintaining the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 4's bid of 6 5s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (22340993), I have zero 5s. The current bid claims there are at least 6 fives among all 40 digits. With 5 players having 8 digits each, that's 40 total digits. For the bid to be true, the other 4 players would need to have at least 6 fives among their 32 digits. This is certainly possible (about 1.5 fives per player on average). Since I don't have strong evidence that the bid is false, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, which gives me confidence to bid on 9s. I'll bid 7 0s, which is higher than the current bid of 6 5s by increasing the quantity. I have one 0 in my hand, so I'm claiming there are at least 6 more among the other players, which seems reasonable.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. With 40 total digits across 5 players, 7 0s is a high number. My hand contains one 0, but others may not have enough to meet this bid. Challenging is a reasonable risk to test the validity of the bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid that reflects my hand's strength. Bidding 4 9s increases the quantity from my actual count (3) to 4, which is a valid higher bid and leverages the high frequency of 9s in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I can see my entire hand (26751358) and there are no 9s in it. The current bid claims there are at least 4 nines across all hands (32 total digits). Given that I have zero 9s, and there are only three other players, each with 8 digits, they would need to have at least 4 nines between them (more than 1 nine per player on average) which seems unlikely. Based on my hand information and the probability, I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand contains no 9s, making the bid's validity uncertain. However, challenging carries risk if the bid is true. Instead, I can safely raise the bid using my strong holdings in 4s (five 4s in my hand). Bidding 4 4s is a valid higher bid and almost certainly true, as my hand alone provides five 4s. This forces the next player to either challenge or raise further.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 65478293, which contains one 4. The current bid is 4 4s by Player 2. With a total of 24 digits across all three players, a bid of 4 4s is plausible but on the lower side of probability (about 16.7% of total digits if evenly distributed). I don't have a strong reason to challenge since I have one 4 myself, and it's possible the other players have the remaining three 4s. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Since I have two 5s in my hand, bidding 4 5s feels reasonable as it increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, and I contribute half of the required count myself.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have five 4s in my hand, which guarantees at least 5 total 4s across all players. Bidding 5 4s is a valid higher bid than 4 9s (higher quantity takes precedence over digit value). This leverages my strong hand while avoiding the risk of challenging an uncertain 9s count.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:2 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 65478293, which contains two 4s. The current bid by Player 2 is 5 4s. Given that there are 24 total digits across three players, and I have two 4s, it means the other two players must collectively have at least three 4s for the bid to hold. This is possible (e.g., one player could have three 4s, or they could be split), but not guaranteed. However, looking at the bidding history, Player 2 has consistently bid on 4s, which might indicate they have a strong count of 4s. Previous challenges on other digits show mixed outcomes, but in the last round with a bid of 6 4s by Player 2, it wasn't challenged, suggesting confidence in 4s. Challenging now carries risk since 5 4s is plausible (e.g., if Player 2 has three 4s and Player 0 has one, the total would be six). Instead, Iâ€™ll make a safer bid by increasing the digit to 5s, as I also have two 5s in my hand, making a bid of 5 5s reasonable and slightly more conservative while still advancing the bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains three 9s, and the current bid is 5 5s. Bidding 5 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) that leverages my hand's strength in 9s. This move increases the bid without overextending, as the total digits (24) allow for at least 5 9s if others have some.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains five 4s, making a bid on 4s more plausible. The current bid is 5 9s, which I cannot support. Bidding 6 4s increases the quantity and leverages my high count of 4s. With two other players, even if they have no 4s, my five plus zero would only reach five, but realistically, others likely hold at least one 4. This bid is safer than challenging 5 9s, which could be true if others have multiple 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s by Player 2. In my hand, I have two 4s out of my 8 digits. With three active players and a total of 24 digits, it's possible that there are 6 or more 4s across all hands, as each player could have a few. However, based on the bidding history, Player 2 has been consistently bidding on 4s, which might indicate they have a strong count of 4s, but it also raises the possibility of a bluff since they increased from 5 to 6. I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Given that I have two 4s, and considering the average distribution (24 digits means roughly 2.4 of each digit if evenly distributed), 6 4s is plausible but on the higher side. However, I also have two 5s in my hand, and bidding 6 5s would be a reasonable escalation since it's a higher digit with the same quantity. I think it's safer to bid rather than challenge at this point, as a challenge could be risky if Player 2 indeed has a strong hand of 4s.

Bidding higher (e.g., 7 9s) is risky without supporting digits. Challenging is optimal, as the bid of 6 9s is statistically improbable given my hand and the low probability of other players holding sufficient 9s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have four 4s in my hand. Since there are two players with 8 digits each, the maximum possible 4s is 8.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 65478293, which contains two 5s, one 4, one 6, one 7, one 8, one 2, and one 9. The current bid by Player 2 is 5 4s. In my hand, I have only one 4, which means that for the bid to be true, Player 2 must have at least 4 fours in their hand of 8 digits. This seems somewhat unlikely, as it would require them to have a highly concentrated hand of 4s. With only 16 total digits in play, a bid of 5 4s is a significant claim (over 30% of all digits). I could make a higher bid like 5 5s since I have two 5s, but I believe challenging might be the better option given the improbability of Player 2 having so many 4s. I will challenge the bid.
