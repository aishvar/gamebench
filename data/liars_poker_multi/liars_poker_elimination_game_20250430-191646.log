Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid of the game, I need to make a strategic opening bid. Looking at my hand (10064673), I have one 0, one 1, one 4, one 6, one 7, and one 3. I don't have any duplicates in my hand. A conservative opening bid would be to bid on a digit I have at least one of. I'll choose to bid '6 0s', which means I'm claiming there are at least 6 zeros among all players. Since I have one 0 in my hand, I'm betting that the other 5 players combined have at least 5 more zeros, which is reasonable given that there are 40 more digits among other players (5 players × 8 digits each).

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. In my hand (43620419), I have one 0. With 48 digits in play, it's plausible that there are at least 6 zeros, as the expected average per digit is 4.8. Challenging now would be premature. The minimal valid raise is either 7 0s or 6 1s. I have two 1s in my hand, which gives me some confidence. I will bid 6 1s, as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, which is a valid and safe incremental bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 21305428, which contains one 0. The current bid is 1 0s. Since I have a 0, and there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total digits), bidding 2 0s is a safe and logical next move, as it's highly probable there is at least one other 0 among the remaining 4 players.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 75031032, which contains two 0s. The current bid is 2 0s by Player 3, and since I have two 0s myself, it is possible that the total count of 0s across all players could be at least 2. However, given that the total digits are 40 and there are 5 players, the average number of any digit per player is about 4 across all hands. Bidding higher on 0s seems risky since a previous round had a high bid of 6 0s, and the current bid is low at 2 0s, which is likely true. I will make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 1s with the same quantity, as it's a safer incremental step while observing other players' reactions. I don't have any 1s, but statistically, it's plausible there are at least two 1s in the total pool.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding 2 5s is strictly higher and guaranteed to be true based on my hand alone. This forces opponents to either challenge (and lose) or raise further.

Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (10064673), I have zero 5s. The current bid is '2 5s', meaning Player 5 claims there are at least 2 fives among all 40 digits. Since I don't have any 5s, those would have to come from the other players' hands. With 5 players having 8 digits each (40 total), and an even distribution would suggest about 4 of each digit. So 2 fives is actually quite reasonable even though I don't have any. I could challenge, but it's risky as the bid is quite low. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have one 6 in my hand, and I also have one 7. I'll bid '2 6s' which is higher than '2 5s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 21305428. The current bid is 2 7s. I have zero 7s in my hand. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4. A bid of 2 7s is plausible, but I don't have any 7s to support a higher bid on 7s. I have two 2s, one 1, one 3, one 0, one 5, one 4, and one 8. I can bid 3 of a digit I have at least one of. Bidding 3 0s, 3 1s, 3 2s, 3 3s, 3 4s, 3 5s, or 3 8s are all valid higher bids. Bidding 3 2s is a good option as I have two 2s.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 75031032, which contains one 2. The current bid is 3 2s by Player 3. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, the average number of any digit across all hands would be around 4. Since I only have one 2, it’s possible but not highly likely that there are at least two more 2s among the other 32 digits. However, I’ll assume the bid might be a bluff given the low quantity. Still, I’ll make a higher bid rather than challenge, as challenging carries a higher risk of elimination. I’ll bid 3 3s, as I have two 3s in my hand, making it a safer bid for me with some grounding in my own digits.

Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (10064673), I have one 0, two 6s, one 4, one 7, one 3, and no 5s. The current bid is '3 5s' by Player 5. To make a higher bid, I need to either bid at least 4 of any digit, or 3 of a digit higher than 5 (i.e., 3 6s, 3 7s, 3 8s, or 3 9s). Since I have two 6s in my hand, bidding '3 6s' seems reasonable - I only need one more 6 among the other 32 digits held by other players, which is quite likely. I could also bid '3 7s' (I have one 7), but that requires two more 7s from other players. Since I have more 6s than 7s, I'll go with '3 6s'.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 21305428. I have zero 7s. The current bid is 3 7s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. While 3 7s is below average, I have no 7s in my hand, making me less likely to support this bid. However, challenging at this point feels risky as 3 7s is not an extremely high bid given the number of players and digits. Bidding higher is the safer option. I have two 2s and one 3. Bidding 4 2s or 4 3s seems reasonable given my hand and the current bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 75031032, which contains two 3s, one 7, one 5, one 0, one 1, and two 2s. The current bid is 4 2s by Player 3. Since I have two 2s myself, that means there need to be at least two more 2s among the other 32 digits across the four other players for the bid to hold. With 40 total digits, it's plausible that there could be four or more 2s in play, as each player averages 8 digits. Bidding history shows a steady increase in bids, and no one has challenged yet, suggesting confidence in moderate bids. I think it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I’ll bid 4 3s, as I have two 3s in my hand, making it somewhat likely that there are at least two more 3s out there.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding 4 5s means only two more 5s are needed among the other 32 cards (expected ~3.2). This is a strong, plausible raise that increases the digit while keeping the quantity at 4.

Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (10064673), I have zero 5s. The current bid is 4 5s from Player 5. With 5 active players and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. For there to be at least 4 5s, the other 4 players would need to have those 5s. This is certainly possible. I have one 6 in my hand, so I could bid 4 6s to increase the digit while keeping the same quantity. I also have one 7 in my hand, so I could bid 4 7s. Since I have two 6s, bidding 5 6s is risky as it would require 3 more 6s among other players. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 4, one 6, one 7, and one 3, but no 5s. I think bidding 4 6s is reasonable as it's a minimal increase from the current bid while using information from my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. The bid of 4 7s is exactly the average. While it's possible there are four 7s, it's not overwhelmingly likely. However, challenging is risky when the bid is at the average. I should consider making a higher bid. I have two 2s, one 1, one 3, one 0, one 5, one 4, and one 8. Bidding 5 of any digit is a significant jump. Bidding 4 of a higher digit is also an option. I have no 8s or 9s. Bidding 4 8s or 4 9s would be a bluff. Bidding 5 of a digit I have multiple of, like 5 2s, is a possibility, but 5 is significantly above the average. Given the progression of bids, increasing the quantity seems to be the trend. Bidding 5 0s seems reasonable as I have one 0 and the average is 4. It's a plausible bid to keep the pressure on.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 75031032, which contains two 0s. The current bid is 5 0s by Player 3. With 40 total digits across 5 players, an average of 4 digits per digit type (0-9) is expected. Since I have two 0s, it's plausible that there are at least three more 0s among the other 32 digits, making a total of 5 or more 0s possible. However, bidding history shows Player 0 and Player 2 have bid on higher digits recently, which might indicate they don't have many 0s. Still, the bid of 5 0s is not outrageously high. I will make a higher bid rather than challenge. I have two 3s in my hand, so bidding 5 3s feels reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit, aligning with my hand strength.

Player 0 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher than 5 5s or challenge it. Looking at my hand (10064673), I have zero 5s. For the bid of 5 5s to be valid, there need to be at least 5 fives among all players. With 5 active players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. If I have zero 5s, then the other 4 players would need to have at least 5 fives among them, which is certainly possible. However, Player 5 has been consistently bidding on 5s (2 5s, 3 5s, 4 5s, and now 5 5s), which suggests they might have several 5s in their hand. I have two 6s in my hand, so I could bid 5 6s, increasing the digit but keeping the same quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 6 0s since I have one 0 in my hand. Given the pattern of increasing bids, I'll go with 5 6s to stay conservative with the quantity.

With 32 total digits across 4 players, it's plausible that there are at least 2 twos in play, especially since I have one. However, I need to make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity to 3 or more of a digit or keep the quantity at 2 but bid on a higher digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, so bidding 3 3s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a stronger but still believable bid based on my own digits. Alternatively, I could bid something like 2 5s since I have one 5, but increasing the quantity feels like a safer progression. I don't think challenging 2 2s is wise since it's a low bid and likely to be true. Therefore, I'll bid 3 3s.

The previous bid I made was 4 2s, which was raised by others. A bid of 5 2s would be a valid higher bid and is supported by the two 2s I hold, making it a more confident bid than challenging or bidding on a digit I don't have.

This is possible but seems somewhat unlikely, as it would require an average of more than one 2 per player. The bidding history shows Player 3 has consistently bid on 2s, which might indicate they have a few, but pushing to 5 2s feels like a stretch. I could bid higher, such as 5 3s since I have two 3s in my hand, which feels safer. However, given the moderate risk of 5 2s being accurate, I think challenging might be the better strategic move to potentially eliminate a player and gain an advantage, especially since the bid seems on the higher side for such a specific digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Since it's the start of a new round with no current bid, I need to make an initial bid. I have two 3s in my hand, which gives me some confidence in bidding on 3s. With 24 total digits across three players, a bid of 3 3s is conservative and reasonable to start the round, as it is likely achievable even if other players have one or two 3s. This bid also allows room for escalation in subsequent turns.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have only one 3 in my hand and there are 16 unknown digits. The chance of at least two more 3s among them is under 50%, making the bid unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 75031032, which gives me two 3s, two 0s, and one each of 7, 5, 1, and 2. With only two active players and a total of 16 digits, I should make a conservative bid to start. Bidding 3 3s seems reasonable since I have two 3s myself, and it's possible the other player has at least one 3. This keeps the bid low enough to avoid an early challenge while still reflecting some confidence in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 75031032, which contains one 3 and no 4s. The current bid by Player 2 is 3 4s. Since there are only 16 total digits remaining across both players, and I have no 4s in my hand, the likelihood of there being at least 3 4s depends entirely on Player 2's hand. However, I also consider that Player 2 might be bluffing. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, which is a decent count for a digit. Bidding 4 0s increases the quantity and seems like a reasonable escalation based on my hand strength. I could challenge, but since the bid of 3 4s is not extremely high for 16 digits, it's safer to bid higher rather than risk a challenge.
