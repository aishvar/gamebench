Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 0s. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid that reflects my hand's count of 0s is logical. Bidding 2 0s is a reasonable first move, as it aligns with my cards and follows the initial bidding structure.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand (30681545). Given there are 5 active players with 8 digits each, and Player 0 has bid '2 0s', this seems like a safe bid to build upon. Since I know of one 0, and the previous round revealed at least 4 zeros when there were 6 players, it's very likely there are still more than 2 zeros total. I'll increase to '3 0s' which is a conservative raise that's likely true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have two 8s, one 4, one 2, one 5, one 9, another 2, and a 7 in my hand, but no zeros. Given that zeros are fairly common and the bid is only 3, it seems reasonable to increase the bid slightly to maintain pressure. I can raise the quantity to 4 zeros, which is a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is '4 0s' made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits in my hand: 64583682. I see that I have one 0 in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 40 digits. The bid of '4 0s' seems plausible but not extremely high. I will bid higher than '4 0s' by increasing the quantity. I will bid '5 0s' as it seems reasonable given my hand and the total number of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Given that three other players have already bid on 0s, it's likely that most of the 0s have already been accounted for. Bidding on 0s seems risky. I should challenge the current bid, as it's unlikely that there are 5 0s remaining across all hands.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make a bid higher than zero. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 1 6s is a safe starting point, as it's unlikely to be challenged successfully given the current information.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 6s. The current bid is 1 6s, so bidding 2 6s increases the quantity while maintaining the same digit, which is a valid higher bid. Challenging would be risky since my own hand already has two 6s, making the actual count likely higher than the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (30681545). The current bid of 2 6s from Player 0 seems reasonable given that I have one 6 myself, and there are 32 total digits in play. With 4 players, it's quite likely there's at least one more 6 among the other 24 digits I can't see. I should make a conservative higher bid. Since I'm confident about at least 2 6s existing (my one plus likely one more), I'll bid 2 7s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have two 7s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid. To raise, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Increasing the quantity to 3 0s is valid and likely safer since 0 is a common digit, but I have only one 2 and one 5, so bidding 3 7s or higher digits with quantity 2 is less supported. Bidding 3 0s is a valid higher bid and reasonable given the digits likely in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. With 32 digits remaining and 4 players, it's plausible that there are 3 0s. However, bidding higher on 0s seems risky. I have a 6 in my hand, and previous bids on 6s were made (1 6s and 2 6s). Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand contains two 6s, and with three other players, it's unlikely there are four 6s in total. Challenging this bid is reasonable as the probability of the actual count being less than 4 is high.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (30681545). With 24 total digits and 3 players remaining, the average distribution suggests 8 digits per player. Since I know I have one 6, and Player 5 opened with a very conservative bid of just 1 6s, it's reasonable to bid 2 6s. This is a safe increase given my known 6, and there's a good chance at least one more 6 exists among the other 16 digits I can't see.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have two 8s, one 4, one 2, one 5, one 9, and one 7 in my hand. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 2 and increase the digit. I do not have many 6s, but I do have two 8s, so bidding 2 8s is a reasonable increase, as it is a higher digit with the same quantity. This bid is plausible given the total of 24 digits in play, and it keeps pressure on the next player.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 6 and no 8s in my hand. Player 3 bid 2 8s. Since there are only 24 digits remaining and 3 players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 8. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity feasible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (30681545). The current bid claims there are 3 sixes total among all players. Since I only have one 6, for the bid to be true, the other two players would need to have at least two more 6s between them. While possible, Player 5's aggressive bidding pattern and the fact they've already bid on 6s multiple times suggests they might be bluffing. Additionally, in the previous round, Player 5 made a high bid on 6s that turned out to be exactly correct, making it less likely they have many 6s again. Given this information and my knowledge of only having one 6, I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and have one 0 in my hand (30681545). With 16 total digits between both players, starting with a conservative bid of 2 0s is reasonable. It's likely the opponent has at least one 0 given their frequency in previous rounds, and this gives room for the bidding to develop while being relatively safe.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have two 8s in my hand, which suggests that bidding on 8s might be a good move. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since the current quantity is 2, I can bid 2 8s, which is higher than 2 0s because the digit 8 is greater than 0. This is a reasonable and safe bid based on my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand (30681545), I have zero 8s. The current bid is '2 8s' by Player 3. With 16 total digits and 8 in each player's hand, there can be at most 8 eights in Player 3's hand. Since I have none, and Player 3 bid 2 8s, it's likely they have at least 2 eights in their hand. I could bid '2 9s' to increase the digit while keeping the same quantity, but since I only have one 5 and no 9s in my hand, that would be risky. The safer play is to bid '3 0s' since I can see I have one 0 in my hand, making it more likely there are at least 3 total zeros between both hands.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s by Player 2. I have two 8s in my hand, and the previous bid was 2 8s by me. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the current bid is 3 0s, I can bid 4 0s to increase quantity, which is plausible given 16 total digits. Alternatively, bidding 3 9s is higher but riskier. Bidding 4 0s is safer and more believable considering the previous bids and my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (30681545), I have only one 0. With 16 total digits between both players and Player 3 claiming there are 4 zeros, this means they would need to have 3 zeros in their hand for this to be true. While possible, this seems unlikely given they've seen me bid confidently on zeros earlier. Additionally, they raised from my 3 zeros bid to 4 zeros, suggesting they might be bluffing.
