Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. By bidding 3 4s, I only need one more 4 among the other 40 unknown digits. The probability of at least one 4 in the remaining cards is about 1 - 0.9^40 ≈ 0.985, making this a very safe opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have one 7 and no 4s in my visible hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 4s, I'm inclined to believe the count of 4s is less than 3 * 6 = 18 (if all other players had 3 or more 4s). However, I still need to make a bid higher than 3 4s. I can bid 3 5s, increasing the digit. Alternatively, I can bid 4 of any digit. Given my hand, I see two 7s, so bidding 4 7s seems plausible as it increases the quantity and is based on a digit I have some information about.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand and the current bid is 3 5s. Increasing the digit to 6 while keeping the quantity the same is a valid move and reasonable since I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 3 6s puts pressure on the next player while staying within a believable range.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 7s and one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. With 48 digits in play and only a bid of 3 for 7s, it is very likely that there are at least three 7s among all hands. Challenging now would be unwise. I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 8, since I have a 9 but not an 8, or I can increase the digit to 9, where I have one myself. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to 4 for any digit. Given that I have one 9, and 48 digits are in play, bidding 3 9s is a reasonable next step that is higher than 3 7s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Since I have a strong indication of the digit's presence, I should increase both quantity and digit to make a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 4s. With 40 unknown digits, I expect about 4 more 4s, giving around 6 total 4s. Raising to 5 4s is plausible and correctly outbids 4 9s by increasing quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 6 4s seems plausible because it is still relatively low compared to the total number of digits (48). However, I should also consider the distribution and the fact that Player 0 made the bid, possibly indicating they have a strong hand in 4s. I will increase the quantity to make a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. Considering there are 48 digits total and 6 players, the average count for each digit is around 4.8. A bid of 6 4s is plausible but on the higher side. To raise, I need to bid at least 6 5s or 7 0s. Since I have no 5s, and no 0s, bidding 6 5s is risky. Bidding 7 0s is a large jump and may be unlikely. Therefore, challenging the current bid may be the best move as it could be an overbid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 and one 8 in my hand, but no 4s or 9s. The previous round showed that 6 4s was an overbid, so I will start conservatively. The lowest possible bid is 1 0s, but that is too weak. I will bid 2 4s, as 4s are common and this is a reasonable opening bid to build from.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. In my hand (15936197), I have one 5. With 40 total digits and 2 needed, it is likely there are at least two 5s among all hands, so challenging is not optimal. The minimum valid raise is either 2 6s or 3 0s. I have one 6 and two 9s. Bidding 2 6s is reasonable since I hold one 6, and it only requires one more among the remaining 32 digits. This is a safe, incremental bid that keeps the pressure low.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. To raise the bid above 3 6s, bidding 4 4s leverages my hand and has a high probability (over 80%) that the remaining cards contain at least two more 4s to meet the bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s, and I must bid higher. I have one 4 in my hand. The previous bids show cautious increments, and bidding 4 5s is the next valid step with the same quantity but higher digit. Given the total of 40 digits, 4 occurrences of a digit is plausible, and increasing the digit to 5s is reasonable.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s. With 40 digits in play and 8 in my hand, I only know of one 6. Statistically, there are likely to be more 6s among the other 32 digits, but the bid of 4 6s is not unreasonable. However, I don't have enough information to confidently challenge. The next legal bid is either 4 7s or 5 0s. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 4 7s is a reasonable incremental increase, leveraging my strong holding in 7s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have 8 digits in my hand, and the current bid is 4 7s. With the maximum possible quantity being 40, I can safely increase the digit to 8, as it's unlikely to reach 40 7s. I have no 7s in my hand, but I have three 3s, which are not as high as 8. I should make a bid with a higher digit.

The next valid higher bid could be either 3 5s or 4 0s. I have one 5 in my hand as well, so bidding 3 5s is a safe incremental increase and more believable than jumping quantity.

However, I only have one, so I can't be confident enough to challenge yet. The next valid bid must be either 3 7s or 4 0s (or higher). I have two 7s and two 9s in my hand, making 3 7s a safe incremental bid based on my hand. This keeps the pressure on others without overcommitting.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (30568821). To make a valid higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit. The next valid bids after 3 9s would be 4 0s or higher quantity with any digit. Since I have no 0s in my hand, but I do have one 8, bidding 4 0s is the lowest possible increment and reasonable given the total digits. Bidding 4 0s is a safer increase than challenging at this point.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have the digits 3, 0, 5, 6, 8, 8, 2, 1 in my hand. Since no bids have been made yet this round, I want to start with a moderate bid. I have two 8s, which is the highest count of any digit in my hand. Starting with 2 8s is reasonable and conservative, as it is likely there are more 8s across all players.

Challenging now is risky. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 2 and move to a higher digit (9).

To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity to 4 or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have no 0s in my hand (15936197). With 24 digits in play and only 8 known to me, it's possible but not certain there are 4 zeros among the remaining 16 digits. Since the bid is not extreme and there is a reasonable chance the other two players have some zeros, a challenge is risky. I should make a higher bid. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 4 9s is a reasonable and legal higher bid (same quantity, higher digit), and my own hand supports it.

Bidding 2 5s is a safer increment and I have one '5', so it is plausible. Therefore, I will bid 2 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s; bidding 3 4s is a valid raise (same quantity, higher digit), and I need only one more 4 from my opponent. The probability of at least one 4 in their 8 cards (~57%) makes this a reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s, meaning there are at least three 4s in total. I have one 4 in my hand (30568821). To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since 3 5s would be a valid higher bid and I have one 5, bidding 3 5s seems reasonable. Increasing the digit by one while keeping the quantity the same is a cautious but valid move given the current bid and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand and the opponent only has eight cards. The probability of there being at least two more 5s among them (to reach three total) is under 20%, making the bid very unlikely. I should challenge.
