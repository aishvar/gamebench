Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. Starting the bidding with 3 7s is a safe bid since the total count cannot be less than 3. This bid is truthful and cannot be successfully challenged.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '7' in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which seems plausible given 48 digits in total and multiple players. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since 3 8s is a valid higher bid and I have zero 8s, it's a bit riskier but still reasonable. Alternatively, bidding 4 0s is also valid and I have two 0s. Bidding 4 0s increases the quantity and uses a digit I hold, making it a stronger bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits. The expected average count for any digit is 4.8. I have one 0 in my hand (02269613). This means the bid requires only 3 more 0s among the remaining 40 digits held by the other 5 players. This is statistically plausible, making a challenge risky. I should make a higher bid. I have two 2s in my hand. Bidding 4 2s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid only requires two more 2s among the other 40 digits, which is highly probable given I already hold two. This is a safe bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have the digits 4, 7, 0, 8, 7, 0, 7, 5 in my hand. Counting the 2s, I see zero 2s in my hand. Bidding 4 2s seems unlikely given I have no 2s, so increasing the quantity to 5 is risky. The next higher digit after 2 is 3, but I have no 3s either. The only option is to challenge, as the bid seems improbable with no supporting digits in my hand and the total remaining digits being only 48.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round (Player 2). My hand is 02269613, which contains two 6s. There are 5 active players and 40 total digits. The statistical average for any digit is 4 (40 digits / 10 possible digits). Since I have two 6s, it increases the likelihood of more 6s existing in total. The expected number of 6s across all hands, given my hand, is 2 (mine) + (32 other digits * 1/10) = 2 + 3.2 = 5.2. An opening bid of '4 6s' is statistically sound, below the expected value based on my hand, and leverages one of the digits I hold multiple copies of.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits left (4 other players × 8 digits), the expected number of additional 6s is about 3.2, giving better than a 60% chance that there are at least three more 6s and thus at least five in total. Challenging a very plausible bid of 4 6s would be risky, so the safest legal raise is to increase the quantity by one while keeping the same digit. Therefore I will bid 5 6s.

Player 4 Reasoning: I start the round and have two 6s in my eight-digit hand. With 24 unseen digits among the other three players, the expected additional number of 6s is about 2–3, making a total of at least four 6s quite likely. Opening with 4 6s is a solid, defensible bid that leverages my hand strength without being excessively high.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. With no 6s in my hand (77521237), the expected number of 6s in the remaining 24 digits (across Players 1, 2, and 4) is approximately 2.4. Since 4 is significantly higher than this expectation, challenging has a high probability of success. Using a Poisson approximation (λ=2.4), the probability of ≥4 6s is ~22%, meaning there's ~78% chance the bid is false. Challenging is statistically favorable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I am the first to bid this round. In my 8-digit hand I hold two 6s (36095618). Across the remaining 16 unknown digits, the expected number of additional 6s is 1.6, giving roughly an 81% chance that at least one more 6 exists. Therefore a starting bid of 3 6s is very likely to be true if it is immediately challenged, yet it is high enough to force the next player to either raise the quantity or move to a higher digit. Bidding any higher (e.g., 4 6s) would drop my win probability below 50%, which is unnecessary for an opening move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand, so the total count must be at least 3. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since the current bid is 3 6s, the next valid bids could be 3 7s or 4 0s or higher. I have one 0 in my hand, so bidding 4 0s is reasonable as it increases the quantity and plays to my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s made by Player 1. There are 24 total digits among 3 players. My hand is 02269613, containing one 0. For the bid to be true, the other two players (Player 1 and Player 4) need to have at least three 0s combined in their 16 digits. While slightly above the statistical average (2.4 expected 0s in 24 digits), 4 is not an excessively high bid, making a challenge risky, especially since Player 1 likely bid based on having some 0s. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 2s and two 6s. Bidding 4 2s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This requires only two more 2s among the other 16 digits, which is statistically plausible. Bidding 4 6s is also an option, but Player 4 previously bid 3 6s, making the situation around 6s less clear. Therefore, bidding 4 2s is a safer, logical move based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I hold zero 2s in my eight-digit hand. That leaves 16 unseen digits between Players 1 and 2. Even if the digits are uniformly distributed, the chance of finding at least four 2s among those 16 digits is under 10%. Player 2 would need three or four 2s in their own hand to make this bid reasonably safe, but the odds of any one player holding that many 2s in eight digits are very small (≈4% for three, <1% for four). Given these probabilities, the current bid of 4 2s is far more likely to be an overstatement than true. Challenging offers an excellent (>90%) chance to eliminate Player 2 and reach heads-up play.

Player 4 Reasoning: With only two players left, an opening bid that I can guarantee is safest. I see exactly two 6s in my own eight digits, so I know there are at least two 6s in play. Bidding "2 6s" cannot be successfully challenged by my opponent, yet it is low enough to give me flexibility for later raises if needed.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (digit '6' appears once). Since I need to make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Bidding 2 7s is a valid higher bid and reasonable since I don't have any 7s, but it's a modest increase. Bidding 3 0s is also possible and I have two 0s in my hand, making it a safer bid. I will bid 3 0s to increase the quantity and use a digit I have multiple times, making the bid more credible.

Player 4 Reasoning: I can see only one 0 in my hand. To make Player 1’s bid of 3 0s true, they must have at least two 0s in their eight cards. For a random eight-digit hand the chance of holding two or more 0s is about 19%, so there’s roughly an 81% chance the total number of 0s is under three. Challenging therefore offers a strong majority chance of winning the game immediately, while raising the bid would just prolong the round with no better odds.
