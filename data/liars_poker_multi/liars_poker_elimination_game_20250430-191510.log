Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I should make a conservative but reasonable opening bid based on my hand. My hand is 75894963, which contains: one 7, one 5, one 8, one 9, one 4, one 9 (so two 9s), one 6, and one 3. Since I have two 9s, it's likely there are more 9s among the 48 digits. A safe opening is to bid 3 9s, as it's not too aggressive but likely to be true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. To outbid 3 9s I must raise the quantity to 4. Bidding 4 8s is reasonable since I only need two more 8s among the 40 unknown digits, which is likely (~92%).

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that there are 48 total digits remaining, it's possible that there are 4 8s among the players. However, since I have one 8, it's risky to bid higher on 8s. I should try to bid on a different digit. I have two 9s, so bidding 5 9s is a reasonable move, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. My hand has no 9s, and the expected number of 9s across all players is 4.8 (48 total digits / 10 possible digits). This suggests the actual count might be less than 5, making a challenge a reasonable risk. Bidding higher would require assuming more 9s exist, which is less likely given the expectation.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. The previous round confirmed that there are at least 6 9s in total. Bidding 7 9s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand and the confirmed count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 74011526, which contains no 9s. The current bid is 7 9s by Player 2. With 5 active players and a total of 40 digits, an average of 4 digits per digit value (0-9) would be expected across all hands. A bid of 7 9s is above average for a single digit, and since I have none, it feels slightly high but still plausible given the previous round had 6 9s with 6 players. However, with one less player now, the likelihood might be lower. I could challenge, but the risk is high since the actual count was 6 last round with more players. Instead, I’ll make a safer bid of 8 0s, increasing the quantity and switching to a digit I have one of in my hand, which might be more believable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: In my hand, I only have one 0. For the current bid of '8 0s' to be valid, there would need to be 7 more zeros among the other 4 players (32 digits). While possible, this seems unlikely given that zeros are not particularly common and the bid is relatively high. My hand also contains two 9s, and earlier bids focused on 9s, suggesting other players may have more 9s than 0s. The high bid of 8 0s feels risky enough to challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 8s, one 9, and one 0. With 32 total digits in play (8 digits × 4 players), and being first to bid in this round, I should make a conservative opening bid. Since I have two 8s, there's a good chance other players have some 8s too. A bid of 3 8s would be a safe starting point, as it only requires one more 8 across three other players to be valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand (75894963). With 32 digits in play, the expected average per digit is 3.2, so a bid of 3 8s is reasonable and not worth challenging. To make a strictly higher bid, I can either bid 3 9s (same quantity, higher digit) or 4 0s (higher quantity, any digit). I have two 9s in my hand, which makes 3 9s a safe bid. Bidding 3 9s is a minimal raise and keeps my options open.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand and no 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, so I must bid at least 4 of any digit. With 24 unknown cards and an expected 2.4 additional 8s, the probability of at least two more 8s is about 97%. Bidding 4 8s is a safe increase in quantity and leverages my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Given that 32 digits remain across 4 players, it's plausible that there could be at least 5 8s. Bidding 5 8s is a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity of the current digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and Player 2 is claiming there are five 8s total. Given that I can see two 8s, and the previous bid by Player 1 was four 8s, it's plausible there are five 8s total. Since I can account for 40% of the claimed quantity with just my hand, and there are three other players who could easily have the remaining three 8s between them, I should not challenge. Instead, I'll bid six 8s, as I have confidence in the presence of 8s and want to maintain control of the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 75894963, which contains one 8. The current bid is 6 8s, meaning there must be at least six 8s among the 32 digits. With only one in my hand, there would need to be five more among the other 24 digits (about a 21% chance per digit). This is plausible, but not certain. However, since I have only one 8, and the bidding has escalated quickly to 6 8s, it's risky to keep raising on 8s. Instead, I can bid 6 9s, since I have two 9s in my hand, making it more likely that there are at least six 9s in total. This raises the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid and safer strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and with 32 digits there are on average ~3.2 nines total, so a claim of six 9s is highly unlikely and raising to seven of any digit is even less plausible. I should challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first to bid this round. My hand is 75894963, which contains two 9s and one 8. Since I am starting, I want to make a reasonable opening bid that is not too aggressive but also not too weak. Bidding 3 9s is a standard opener, as I hold two 9s myself, making it likely there are at least three among all 24 digits.

Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round with no current bid, I should start with a safe and strong opening. In my hand (75894963), I have two 9s, two 8s, one 7, one 5, one 4, one 6, and one 3. The highest count is two 9s and two 8s. Historically, 9s have been strong for me and have won challenges. I will open with a conservative but credible bid of 2 9s, which is likely to be true given my own hand and puts some pressure on my opponent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have 2 nines in my hand (72889840). Since there are only 16 total digits in play (8 per player), and Player 0 has consistently shown accurate knowledge of nines throughout the game, their bid of 2 9s is likely based on having at least one 9 in their hand. Since I know I have exactly 2 nines, and they're bidding 2 nines total, this suggests they might not have any nines. I could safely bid '3 0s' since I have one 0 in my hand, but given the history and current situation, challenging their bid of 2 9s when I alone have 2 nines seems like the winning move.
