Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. With 48 total digits and assuming a uniform distribution, I expect about 4 7s among the other 40 unseen digits. That plus my two gives an expected total of 6, so bidding 5 7s is a reasonable, somewhat aggressive opening with a high probability of being correct.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:5 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, and the current bid is 5 7s. The expected number of 7s in the remaining 40 digits is 4 (40 * 0.1), making the total likely around 5. However, the bid requires at least 5, and with only a 50% chance of the count being exactly 5 or higher, challenging is a reasonable risk to eliminate a player if the bid is incorrect.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. With 40 total digits, the expected count of any digit is 4. I only need two more 7s among the 32 unknown digits, which has a high probability. Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable opening that leverages my hand without being overly risky.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s and one 7 in my hand. Player 0 bid 4 7s. Since I have one 7, it's likely there are at least 4 7s among all players. However, bidding 5 7s would be risky as Player 1 already challenged and lost to a bid of 5 7s. Instead, I can bid 4 8s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which seems reasonable given the remaining digits and the history of bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 9s and the current bid is 4 9s. To raise I must bid at least five of some digit. I’m strongest in 9s, and needing three more 9s among the other 32 digits is still quite plausible (over a 60% chance), so I’ll bid 5 9s.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:2 - google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. There are 40 total digits. The expected number of any digit is 4. I have zero 9s in my hand (86474840). This means the other 4 players need to have at least five 9s among their 32 digits for the bid to be true. The expected number of 9s among those 32 digits is 3.2. While 5 is above the expectation, challenging is risky with 5 players left. I need to make a higher bid. The minimum higher bid is 6 0s. Looking at my hand, I have three 4s. Bidding 6 4s requires only three more 4s among the other 32 digits. Since the expected number of 4s in those 32 digits is 3.2, needing only 3 is statistically reasonable and strongly supported by my hand. This seems like a safer and more strategic move than challenging or bidding on a digit I hold fewer of.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand and would need at least five more 4s among the 32 unknown digits to make the bid of 6 4s true. The expected number of 4s in 32 random digits is only 3.2, and the probability of seeing ≥5 is roughly 22%, so the current bid is highly unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. With 32 total digits and an expected 3.2 of each digit, bidding 4 7s (needing just two more among the 24 unknown cards) gives me around a 70% chance of being correct, making it a strong opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 0. I have two 7s in my hand, which means there could potentially be 2 more 7s among the other players' hands, making the bid likely valid. However, I also have two 8s in my hand. Given the bidding history and the fact that Player 0 bid 4 7s, it seems reasonable to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Bidding 4 8s is a safe and strategic move, as it is likely that at least four 8s exist among all players' hands.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid of 1 zero is too low to challenge. I hold two 9s in my hand, guaranteeing at least two 9s across all hands. Bidding 2 9s is a valid higher bid and is safe based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand. The bid of 2 9s requires at least two 9s among the 16 unseen cards. The probability of two or more 9s in 16 random digits is about 48.6%, so it’s slightly more likely the bid is false. I should challenge.
