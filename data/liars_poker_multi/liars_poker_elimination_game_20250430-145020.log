Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 82700883, which gives me two 8s, two 0s, and single digits for 2, 7, and 3. Bidding on 8s seems reasonable as I have two of them, and with 48 total digits across 6 players, it's plausible that there are at least a couple more 8s out there. I'll bid 4 8s to start with a moderate bid that reflects some confidence in my hand while leaving room for others to bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits in total. The current bid is 4 8s, which is plausible at this early stage. I could raise the bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 4s, bidding 4 9s would be risky without any 9s in my hand. However, I also have two 0s, so bidding 4 9s or 5 8s are my options. Bidding 5 8s is a reasonable incremental raise, supported by my own hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: As the first bidder this round, I should make a reasonable opening bid based on my hand. My hand is 70416084, which contains the following digit counts: 0 (1), 1 (1), 4 (2), 6 (1), 7 (1), 8 (2). With five players and 40 digits, an opening bid of 3 of a digit I have multiple of is safe and reasonable. Since I have two 4s and two 8s, I will bid 3 8s to start, as 8 is often a strong digit to bid early.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains one 8. The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 1. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected number of any digit is around 4 (40 / 10).  Player 1 already bid 3 8s, and the previous round showed a high count of 8s (actual count was 6). However, bidding 4 8s is a reasonable increase given my one 8 and the previous history. It's a safe bid that's higher than the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand. Previous round revealed 6 8s with 48 total digits, but one player was eliminated taking their digits with them. With 40 total digits now and no 8s in my hand, for there to be 4 8s, the remaining players would need to have all those 8s. While possible, given the previous round's information and my hand, it seems unlikely that 4 8s still exist. The safer play is to challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I am the first to bid in this round. My hand is 98356957. I have two 9s, two 5s, one 8, one 3, one 6, and one 7.  With 32 total digits, a bid of 4 of any digit is possible. Given I have two 9s, bidding 4 9s is a reasonable starting bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. My hand contains one 8, and previous bids have focused on 8s. Bidding 5 8s increases the quantity while targeting a digit I have, making it a reasonable higher bid. Challenging risks losing if the actual count of 9s is ≥4, which seems plausible given the game's history of higher actual counts.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains three 8s out of my eight digits. The current bid is 5 8s by Player 5. Given that there are 32 total digits across four players, and I already have three 8s, the bid of 5 8s means only two more 8s are needed from the remaining 24 digits, which is quite plausible. Historically, bids around 4 to 6 8s have been successful in previous rounds, as seen with counts of 6. Therefore, challenging seems risky. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 5 8s, I can bid higher by increasing the quantity or keeping the quantity and increasing the digit. Bidding 6 8s feels too aggressive given I only have three, but since 8s seem common based on history, I’ll bid 6 8s to push the limit slightly while staying within a believable range.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 70416084, which contains two 8s. The current bid is 6 8s. With 4 players and 8 digits each, there are 32 digits in play. The bid requires there to be at least 6 eights among all hands. I have 2, so the remaining 24 digits (held by 3 other players) would need to contain at least 4 more eights. The expected number of 8s in 24 random digits is about 2.4 (24/10), making 6 eights quite unlikely. Given the recent history of successful high 8s bids, it's possible players are overestimating, but the probability is low enough that challenging is the best move.

Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round with no current bid to beat, I can start with a conservative bid. My hand is 82700883, which contains four 8s. Since there are 24 total digits across three players, bidding 5 8s is a reasonable starting point. It leverages my strong hand in 8s and leaves room for escalation in future bids. I believe this bid is safe enough to avoid an immediate challenge while setting a baseline for the round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 5 8s by Player 0. With 24 total digits, the average count for any digit is 2.4 (24 / 10).  A bid of 5 8s is significantly higher than the average, but the history shows that 8s have been prevalent in previous rounds, with actual counts of 6 in two different challenges. Player 0 is the current bidder and is likely basing their bid on their hand.  While 5 8s is a high bid, given the history and the possibility of Player 0 having multiple 8s, challenging is risky.  I can make a slightly higher bid to put pressure on the next player. Increasing the quantity to 6 seems too aggressive given I only have one 8. Bidding 5 9s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid and is supported by me having two 9s in my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. My hand contains no 9s, and with 24 total digits remaining, it's plausible the actual count of 9s is less than 5. Challenging this bid risks eliminating the bidder if the count is insufficient, which aligns with my hand's lack of 9s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with 3 5s is a logical bid based on my hand. This quantity matches the number of 5s I hold, and the digit 5 is present in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 82700883, which contains three 8s, two 0s, one 2, one 7, and one 3. The current bid by Player 5 is 3 5s. I have no 5s in my hand, so I must estimate the likelihood of there being at least three 5s across both hands (16 total digits). Since I have no information about Player 5's hand, I assume a uniform distribution of digits. The probability of having 3 or more 5s in 16 digits is reasonable (not extremely low), so challenging might be risky. Instead, I can make a higher bid. Given I have three 8s, bidding 4 8s seems plausible, as it only requires one more 8 in Player 5's hand, which is likely. This increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 3 5s.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 82700883, which contains two 8s and no 5s. The current bid by Player 5 is 5 5s. With only 16 total digits in play between the two of us, and knowing I have no 5s, the bid of 5 5s means Player 5 would need to have at least 5 5s in their 8-digit hand for the bid to be true, which is possible but not highly likely. However, since the bid is not extremely high (5 out of 16 is less than a third), and considering Player 5 might be bluffing or have a few 5s, I’ll choose to bid higher rather than challenge. I have two 8s, so bidding 5 8s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity from the current bid of 5 5s and leverages my own hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. My hand contains one 8, and Player 0 has 8 digits. The total number of 8s would be 1 (my hand) + x (Player 0's hand). For the bid to be valid, x must be ≥4. However, without knowing Player 0's hand, it's risky to assume they have 4 or more 8s. Challenging this bid could expose a potential bluff, as the actual count might be lower than 5. Given the uncertainty and the high risk of the bid being false, challenging is a strategic move.
