Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With 48 total digits and an expected ~4.8 total 6s (about 2.8 among the other five players), bidding 4 6s is a reasonable, safe opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s. Bidding 5 6s increases the quantity while maintaining the digit, which is a valid higher bid. Given that there are 5 other players, it's plausible there are enough 6s to make this bid safe, especially since I hold one. Challenging the current bid would be risky as the count could be accurate.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (the '6' digit appears once). The current bid is 5 6s, which is quite high given that only one player has a 6. Since the total maximum for any digit is 48, and I only hold one 6, the likelihood of there being 5 or more 6s across all players is very low. Challenging now could reveal the truth and eliminate the previous bidder if they are bluffing. Given my hand and the current bid, challenging seems like the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The previous bid was 5 6s, which was challenged and found to be inaccurate (actual count was 4). Now, with no current bid and 40 total digits remaining, I can make a bid. My hand contains 1 six (at position 2), so I know there is at least 1 six among all players. To be safe, I will bid 2 6s, which is higher than 1 6s and within the realm of possibility, considering I only hold one six. Bidding 2 6s increases the likelihood of challenging later if the count is not enough, but it also pushes the game forward.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Given the previous round where a bid of 5 6s was challenged and failed, and the current total digits remaining is 40, a bid of 3 6s seems plausible but risky. I can also consider bidding on other digits. I have two 9s. Bidding 2 9s is a valid move, but doesn't leverage any information from the previous round. I will bid 3 6s, hoping to push the bid slightly and test the waters, but acknowledging it's a moderate risk.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 6. Player 3's bid of 3 6s requires at least two more 6s in other hands. Since challenging would risk elimination if the count is >=3, I prefer to bid higher. My hand has two 3s, making 4 3s a reasonable bid.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:4 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains two 3s. The current bid is 4 3s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, the average count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4 (if digits were evenly distributed).  Player 4's bid of 4 3s is exactly the average.  However, I have two 3s, which is a significant portion of the expected count. The previous bids on 6s suggest there might not be many 6s left.  Given my two 3s and the current bid being at the average, it's plausible that there are at least four 3s among the five players. I will bid higher on 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand and there are 32 unknown digits. The expected number of 3s among them is about 3.2, giving an expected total of 4.2. The probability of at least 5 3s is under 40%, so the bid of 5 3s is unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round, so there is no current bid to beat. I have two 3s, two 4s, one 1, one 5, one 7, and one 8 in my hand. With 4 players and 8 digits each, there are 32 total digits. A bid of 2 3s is a safe starting bid based on my hand, as I know there are at least two 3s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s, and I have the digits 1, 9, 2, 4, 4, 8, 4, 7. Counting the 3s in my hand, I see no 3s at all. Since the total number of 3s across all players cannot be less than 2 (the current bid), I should challenge, as it's unlikely that there are at least two 3s in total given my hand and the previous bids.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 3s, two 4s, one 1, one 5, one 7, and one 8 in my hand. Since I am the first to bid in this round and the current bid is None, I need to make an opening bid. Bidding 2 3s is a safe opening bid as I have two 3s in my hand, and it's a low quantity and digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. Bidding 3 3s is a reasonable increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit, but 3 3s seems like the safest option given my hand and the history of successful bids on 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand, which already fulfills 66% of the current bid of 3 3s. Given that Player 3 made this bid, they likely hold at least one additional 3. Bidding 4 3s leverages my strong position in 3s and forces opponents to either escalate further or challenge a bid that could easily be valid with the combined hands.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand has three 3s. The current bid is 4 3s. With 24 total digits and 3 players, an average digit count is 2.4. Having three 3s in my hand makes 4 3s a plausible bid, but it's close to the edge of what I'd expect. However, I have a strong hand for 3s, and bidding 5 3s is a reasonable increase based on my hand and the previous bids. I've successfully bid on 3s in previous rounds.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. Given the history of successful bids on 3s, and the fact that two players have already bid and been successful on 3s, it's likely there are at least 5 3s in total. Bidding 6 3s would be a reasonable escalation, but might be too risky. I could also bid on a different digit, but given the recent focus on 3s, it's more likely others have them as well. Since I have a 9, and the digit 9 hasn't been bid on, and the current bid is already high, challenging seems like the best option. It's unlikely there are 5 3s given the limited total digits remaining (24) and the previous challenges.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round. I have three 3s and two 4s in my hand. With 16 total digits, a bid of 2 3s is a safe starting point based on my hand, and it's a common opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand, and Player 5's bid of 2 3s indicates they likely hold at least one 3. This makes the total count of 3s at least 3 (my two + Player 5's minimum one). Bidding 3 3s is a safe escalation based on the combined hands and avoids the risk of challenging, which would confirm the bid's validity and eliminate me.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 15343874. I have two 3s. The current bid is 3 3s. There are 16 total digits. A bid of 3 3s means Player 4 is claiming there is at least one 3 in their hand, in addition to my two 3s. It's plausible they have a 3. I have two 3s, and the next logical bid on 3s would be 4 3s, which is a small increase. However, I also have two 4s and one 5, one 7, one 8, and one 1. Bidding 3 4s is a valid higher bid and leverages my two 4s. It's a safer bid than 4 3s, which requires Player 4 to have at least two 3s. Bidding on a different digit with a quantity I can support is a good strategy here.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have zero 4s in my hand, so the bid of 3 4s depends entirely on Player 5's hand. Given the lack of prior bids on 4s and Player 5's recent shift from bidding on 3s, this could be a bluff. Challenging is logical since Player 5 must have at least three 4s for the bid to hold, which seems unlikely given the limited digits in their hand (8 total).
