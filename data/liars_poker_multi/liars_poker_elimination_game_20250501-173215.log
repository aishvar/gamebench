Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 0s. I will bid 3 0s to start the round.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 and one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s. Since I have no 0s, bidding 4 4s is a reasonable move, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand and no 4s. The current bid is 4 4s by Player 1. To raise I need either a higher quantity or the same quantity but a higher digit. Bidding 4 8s is valid and has a high chance of being correct because I cover two of the required 8s and the probability at least two of the other 40 digits are 8s is about 92%.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I need to bid higher either by increasing the quantity or the digit. I have one 8 in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid. Increasing the digit while keeping quantity at 4 is a safer move, so bidding 4 9s is the next valid bid and reasonable given the current bid and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Since no previous bid has been made in this round, I can initiate the bidding. My hand contains the digits 4, 3, 5, 6, 9, 3, 0, 1. I have one 4, one 5, one 6, one 9, one 0, and two 3s. To make a reasonable opening bid, I should choose a number that reflects the likelihood of these digits appearing across all players. Given the total of 40 digits, and my own hand, a safe opening bid could be '4 3s' because I have two 3s, and it's unlikely that the total count of 3s across all players is less than 4, considering the distribution. Starting with a bid of '4 3s' seems reasonable to challenge others to bid higher or challenge me.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. I could bid higher, but without knowing the distribution of digits in other players' hands, it's risky. I'll bid a slightly higher quantity and a low digit to minimize risk, while still making a valid bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '5 0s'. I have one '0' in my hand. Given that there are 40 digits remaining and 5 players, it's plausible that there are at least 5 0s among all hands. However, bidding higher on 0s is risky. I have two '4s' in my hand, and previous bids suggest that higher digits are being played. Bidding '6 4s' increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a reasonable and strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have 0 of the 4s and there are only 32 unknown digits. The expected number of 4s is 3.2 and the probability of at least 6 is under 10%, so Player 1’s bid of 6 4s is very unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: It’s the first bid and I hold two 8s. With 24 unknown cards, the expected number of additional 8s is 2.4, giving an expected total of about 4.4 8s. The chance of at least four 8s is over 70%, making “4 8s” a strong and plausible opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (digit sequence: 4 7 8 2 3 6 6 1). To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. The next valid bids after 4 8s are 4 9s or 5 0s (since digit 9 is higher than 8, and quantity 5 is higher than 4). I have no 9s, but bidding 4 9s is a modest increase and plausible. Bidding 5 0s is riskier as it requires more total zeros. Given the previous bids and my hand, bidding 4 9s is a reasonable and safe increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, and I have the digits 4, 3, 5, 6, 9, 3, 0, 1. Counting the 9s in my hand, I have one 9. Since the bid is for 4 9s, it's highly unlikely that the total across all players reaches that number, especially considering only 4 players are active and each has 8 digits. Challenging the bid seems prudent because the actual count of 9s is probably less than 4, making the bid invalid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 4, 3, 5, 6, 9, 3, 0, 1. Counting these, I have: 4s (1), 3s (2), 5s (1), 6s (1), 9s (1), 0s (1), 1s (1). The total counts I can confirm are limited, but given the previous bids and the total remaining digits (24), the highest bid so far is none, meaning I can start. I want to make a bid that is plausible but not too high, considering my hand. Bidding '4 3s' seems reasonable because I have at least two 3s, and the total number of 3s across all hands could be higher, but I can't be certain. Alternatively, I could bid higher, but since I only have two 3s, bidding higher risks being challenged. Starting with '4 3s' is a cautious, reasonable bid to test opponents' confidence.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. I could bid higher, but I have no information to suggest a higher bid would be accurate. 4 3s with 24 total digits seems plausible, so I will bid higher conservatively. I will bid 5 0s, as I have two 0s in my hand and previously bid 5 0s, but that was in a round with more digits.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 zeros by Player 0. I only have one zero in my hand, so that requires four zeros among the other 16 unknown digits. The probability of that is very low (~18%). I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s, made by Player 0. My hand contains the digits 4, 3, 5, 6, 9, 3, 0, 1. I have one 0, so I can't safely bid higher on the same digit. Bidding 4 0s exceeds my own total count of zeros. Alternatively, I can increase the digit to 1, which I have one of, and bid 3 1s. Since I only have one 1, bidding 4 1s would be risky. The best move is to challenge, as the total zeros are unlikely to be more than 3, given my hand and previous bids.
