Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid of the round and there are no previous bids to consider, I should make a conservative yet strategic opening bid. I have two 5s and two 2s in my hand. Bidding 4 2s is a reasonable starting point, as it is likely that at least four 2s exist among all players' hands, but not so high that it will be easily challenged.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 4 5s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is plausible given I have two 5s and there are 5 other players with 40 digits where the remaining two 5s could easily be found (expected 4 5s among 40 digits). Challenging 4 2s is risky as I already hold two 2s, making it likely the total count is 4 or more.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I hold four 9s in my hand, so I know there are at least four 9s across all 48 digits. Raising to 4 9s is a valid move (same quantity, higher digit) and is guaranteed to be true, as my hand alone meets the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. My hand is 86024751, which contains one 9. Considering the total count of 9s across all players, bidding 5 9s seems plausible as it increases the quantity. However, I should also consider the likelihood of other players having 9s. Since I have one 9 and there are 5 other players, it's reasonable to assume others might have 9s as well. Thus, increasing the quantity to 5 9s is a reasonable next step.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s made by Player 3. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than this. I have the hand 16070443, which contains one 9. I can see that bidding a higher quantity with a lower digit or the same quantity with a higher digit could be options. Since I have one 9, bidding 6 0s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and I have a 0 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 4's bid of 6 0s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (63272406), I have one 0. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. Player 4 is claiming there are at least 6 zeros total. Since I have 1 zero, that means the other 5 players would need to have at least 5 zeros among them, which is an average of 1 zero per player. This seems quite reasonable. For my bid, I could go to 7 0s, but that's risky since I only know about my one 0. I could also switch to a different digit. I have two 2s in my hand, so bidding on 2s gives me more confidence. I'll bid 6 2s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. Based on the game history, the bids have been increasing in digit value. Since I do not have any 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s, or 9s, I cannot bid higher using a higher digit. However, the bid of 6 2s seems reasonable, and I do not have enough information to confidently challenge it. I will bid 7 0s, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same as the highest previous bid (6 0s).

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. I have zero 0s in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits remaining, the expected number of 0s is 4.8. Since I have 0, the other 5 players (40 digits) would need to have at least 7 0s for the bid to be true. The probability of getting 7 or more of a specific digit in 40 random digits (expected 4) is statistically low (approximately 4.8%). Challenging this bid is statistically favorable given my hand knowledge makes the bid less likely than if I had 0s. Bidding higher (e.g., 7 2s or 7 5s, which I have 2 of) would require 5 more of that digit from the other players (expected 4), which is more likely to be true (approximately 38%) than the current bid. Challenging the statistically unlikely bid of 7 0s is the best strategic move.

Player 1 Reasoning: It is the start of a new round and I am the first bidder. I need to make a bid higher than 'None'. My hand contains two 5s. Bidding 3 5s is a conservative opening bid based on my hand, slightly below the expected average count per digit (40 total digits / 10 digits = 4 per digit on average).

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (from 86024751), so I know at least one 9 exists. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll consider the probability and the current bid. Bidding 5 9s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. However, I should also consider challenging if the bid seems too high. Given that there are 40 digits in total and the bid is for 4 9s, it's not extremely unlikely. I'll increase the quantity to make a new bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits: 1, 6, 0, 7, 0, 4, 4, 3. I can see that I have two 0s, which could be useful. However, bidding 6 0s would be a reasonable increase, but I should consider if challenging could be more beneficial. Given that there are 40 total digits and each player has 8 digits, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. The bid of 5 9s seems plausible but not extremely high. I will increase the bid to 6 0s based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '6 0s' made by Player 4. Looking at my hand (63272406), I have one 0. For the bid to be valid, there need to be at least 5 more 0s among the other players' hands. With 5 players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. The probability of a specific digit appearing can be roughly estimated at 1/10 per position, so we might expect around 4 zeros total. Player 4 bidding 6 zeros suggests they might have several in their hand. However, in the previous round, Player 0 bid 7 zeros and was challenged successfully (actual count was 6). This suggests that the total count of zeros has likely decreased from 6 to 5 or fewer since Player 0 was eliminated. Given this history and that I only have one 0, I think challenging is the best move as 6 zeros is likely too high.

Player 5 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding in this round. Looking at my hand (63272406), I have one 0, one 2, two 2s, one 3, one 4, one 6, and one 7. My strongest digit is 2, which appears twice. Since there are 4 players with 8 digits each (32 total digits), I can estimate there might be around 3-4 of each digit in total. Since I have two 2s myself, bidding on 2s gives me some confidence. A conservative starting bid would be 3 2s, which means I only need one more 2 among the other players to be safe.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. My hand contains two 2s and two 5s. With 32 total digits across 4 players, the average expectation for any digit is 3.2. Bidding 4 2s is a reasonable increase in quantity from the current bid, well-supported by the two 2s in my hand and the expectation of finding at least two more 2s among the remaining 24 digits (expected 2.4). Challenging the bid of 3 2s is risky, as I already hold two 2s, meaning the bid is only false if the other three players collectively hold zero 2s, which is unlikely.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since there are 32 total digits and the current bid is 4 9s, and I have one 9, there are at least 1 + x (where x is the number of 9s in other players' hands) 9s. Bidding 5 9s seems plausible as it increases the quantity. However, considering my hand, I can see there's a higher digit than 9 (there isn't, since 9 is the highest), so I should focus on increasing the quantity. I will bid 5 9s.

Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (63272406), I have 0 nines. The current bid is 5 9s across all 32 digits. In previous rounds, Player 2 and Player 3 have consistently bid on 9s, suggesting they might have some 9s in their hands. However, for there to be 5 9s total, the other three players would need to have 5 nines between them, which is possible but getting risky. I could challenge, but if I'm wrong, I'm eliminated. Alternatively, I can make a higher bid. I have two 2s and one 6 in my hand. I could bid 6 0s since I have one 0, but that's risky without knowing others' hands. A safer option is to bid 5 0s or to increase the digit to 6 9s. Since I'm uncertain about the actual count of 9s, I'll bid 6 0s, as I have one 0 in my hand and it's a reasonable increase.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s, made by Player 5. I have zero 0s in my hand. With 32 total digits remaining across 4 players, the average count for any digit is 3.2. A bid of 6 is significantly above this average. Looking at the game history, a bid of 7 0s with 48 digits (density ~0.146) and a bid of 6 0s with 40 digits (density ~0.15) were both successfully challenged. The current bid of 6 0s with 32 digits represents a higher density (~0.188) than those previously failed bids. Given the low probability of 6 or more 0s existing among the remaining 32 digits (especially since I have none) and the historical precedent in this game, challenging the bid of 6 0s is the most strategic move.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 2. I have one 8 and no 9s in my hand (86024751). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have any 9s, bidding 4 9s might be too high unless the other players have a lot of 9s. However, bidding 3 0s is a valid higher bid because 0 is higher than 9 is not true; 0 is lower than 9. So, I need to either bid a higher quantity or accept that my bid must be on a quantity greater than 3. I see that I can bid 4 0s or higher quantity with any digit. Given that I have one 8, I think the total count of 8s could be relatively high. Bidding 3 8s is not valid because it's not higher than 3 9s. So, the next valid bid is 4 0s or any quantity higher than 3 with any digit. I'll choose to bid 4 0s as it seems a reasonable increase.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, made by Player 2. There are 16 total digits remaining (8 in my hand, 8 in Player 2's hand). I have one 9 in my hand.

The probability of having 3 or more of a specific digit in 8 random digits is low (approximately 3.8%). A bid of 4 9s represents 25% of the total digits being 9s, which is significantly higher than the expected 10%.
