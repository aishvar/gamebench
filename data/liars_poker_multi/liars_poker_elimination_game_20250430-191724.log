Player 0 Reasoning: Since no previous bid has been made, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have the digits 9, 0, 3, 4, 7, 1, 2, 1. Counting the total occurrences: 1 nine, 1 zero, 1 three, 1 four, 1 seven, 2 ones, 1 two. The total count of '1's is 2, which is the highest digit count in my hand. To be safe, I will bid 3 ones, which is higher than my maximum count of 2. This sets a reasonable starting bid without overestimating the likelihood of the total count.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one '1' in my hand. Since the bid is low and I can easily increase it, I will raise the bid to 3 2s, which is a higher digit with the same quantity, making it a valid and reasonable bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 2s. The smallest valid increase is raising the digit to 4 while keeping the quantity at 3. With two 4s already, I only need one more among the 40 unknown cards—which is very likely (~99%)—so this bid is both safe and minimally aggressive.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 21710437. I have one 4. The current bid is 3 4s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. On average, you'd expect about 4.8 of any given digit (48 / 10). The current bid of 3 4s is below average and not particularly aggressive. However, I have only one 4. While challenging is an option, bidding is generally preferred early in the game unless the bid is clearly inflated. I can make a higher bid than 3 4s. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid as 7 is a higher digit than 4, and I have two 7s in my hand, making it a plausible bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 70480726, which contains two 7s. The current bid is 3 7s by Player 3. Since I have two 7s myself, it's plausible that there is at least one more 7 among the other 40 digits across the remaining players. The average expected count for any digit across 48 digits is about 4.8, so a bid of 3 is conservative. I will raise the bid to 4 7s, as I believe this is still a reasonable estimate given my own contribution to the count. This also increases the quantity, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I hold two 7s in my hand (72170916). This means only two more 7s are needed across the other 40 digits (5 players * 8 digits) for the bid to be true. The expected average number of any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8. Given that I have two 7s and the expected average is nearly 5, needing only two more from the remaining 40 digits makes the current bid quite plausible. Furthermore, Player 3 previously bid 3 7s, and Player 4 raised it to 4 7s, suggesting others might also hold 7s. Challenging seems risky. I should make a higher bid. Bidding 5 7s is a strong option because I hold two 7s, and the previous bids indicate others might hold them too. Needing three more 7s from 40 digits is reasonable. Other options like 5 1s (I have two 1s) or 4 8s/4 9s (I have one 9, zero 8s) seem less supported or more speculative compared to leveraging my 7s and the bidding history.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s, meaning at least five 7s across all hands. My hand contains one 7, which makes it impossible for the total to reach five 7s. Challenging now would be logical because the bid is clearly too high given my hand. Challenging will reveal whether the bid is valid or not, and since I know I have only one 7, the total cannot be 5 or more. Challenging seems the best move to catch the bidder bluffing.

Player 5 Reasoning: It's my turn to start the bidding for this round. I have 8 digits: 72170916. The most frequent digits in my hand are 1 and 7 (two each). There are 5 active players, totaling 40 digits. The expected average count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. A safe opening bid is typically based on digits held. I hold two 1s. Bidding '3 1s' is a reasonable starting point, as it's statistically likely (expecting 4 total) and grounded in my hand. It's less aggressive than bidding 4 and avoids immediately focusing on 7s, which were the subject of the last challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one '1' in my hand (29409682), which supports the plausibility of the bid but does not guarantee it. Since the bid quantity is low, I can safely raise the bid by increasing either the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit to 3 2s is a valid and reasonable next bid, as I have one '2' in my hand and it is higher than the current bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand and no 2s, so the current bid of 3 2s relies entirely on others’ cards. Bidding 4 8s leverages my two 8s and requires just two more among the 32 unknown digits (about an 84% chance), and using a high digit pressures opponents to either bid 4 9s (only ~63% likely) or jump to quantity 5.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 1s, two 7s, one 2, one 0, one 4, and one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s.  With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4.  A bid of 4 8s is exactly the average, so it's not an outrageous bid. I have zero 8s in my hand, which makes me less likely to bid higher on 8s. I have two 1s, two 7s, and one 2. I can make a higher bid based on these digits. Bidding 5 1s or 5 7s would be a reasonable increase in quantity. Bidding 4 9s would be a reasonable increase in digit. Bidding 5 1s seems like a good move as I have two 1s.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 70480726, which contains one 7, two 0s, one 4, one 8, one 2, and two 6s. The current bid is 5 1s by Player 3. I have no 1s in my hand, which makes the bid seem slightly high, but with 40 total digits across 5 players, it's still plausible that there are 5 or more 1s in play. Challenging feels risky without stronger evidence that the bid is inflated. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. Since I have two 6s, bidding on 6s seems reasonable. I’ll bid 5 6s, maintaining the quantity but increasing the digit, which is a valid higher bid and aligns with my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (72170916). This means the other 4 players need to have at least four 6s among their 32 digits for the bid to be true. The expected number of 6s in those 32 digits is 3.2 (32 * 0.1). Needing 4 is slightly above average but certainly plausible, making a challenge risky at this stage. I need to make a higher bid. Options are quantity 6+ or quantity 5 with digit 7+. My hand contains two 1s and two 7s. Possible safe bids include 5 7s (need 3+ from 32, expected 3.2), 6 1s (need 4+ from 32, expected 3.2), or 6 7s (need 4+ from 32, expected 3.2). Player 3 previously bid 5 1s, suggesting strength in 1s might exist. Bidding 6 1s leverages my two 1s, is statistically reasonable (needing 4 more when 3.2 are expected), and follows the previous bid pattern logically. It increases the quantity, putting pressure on the next player.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have one '1' in my hand (digit '1' appears once). Given that the previous bids have increased steadily and the total digits are 40, bidding 6 2s seems plausible since I have two '2's in my hand. Bidding 6 2s is a higher bid than 6 1s by digit value and still reasonable given the hand and previous bids.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With 24 unseen cards we expect about 2.4 more 8s, so bidding 3 8s is over 90% likely to hold. Using digit 8 also limits same-quantity raises (only 3 9s can outbid), forcing opponents to jump to quantity 4 if they want to contest.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 21710437. I have zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s.  With 4 players and 32 total digits, the average number of any digit is 3.2.  A bid of 3 8s is plausible, but without any 8s in my hand, I'm less inclined to bid higher on 8s. I have two 1s and two 7s. Bidding 4 1s or 4 7s are both valid higher bids based on my hand and the average distribution. Bidding 4 7s seems slightly better as 7s have been bid on more frequently in previous rounds, potentially indicating others have them.  Bidding 4 7s is a safe increase in quantity based on my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 70480726, which contains two 7s. The current bid by Player 3 is 4 7s across all 32 digits in play among the 4 active players. Given that I have two 7s, it means there need to be at least two more 7s in the other 24 digits to meet the bid. This is plausible since each player has 8 digits, and it's possible other players have 7s as well. Historically, in the first round, a bid of 5 7s was exceeded with an actual count of 7, though that was with more players and digits. With fewer digits now (32 vs 48), the likelihood of 4 7s is still reasonable but not certain. However, challenging feels risky since the bid isn't extremely high. I will make a higher bid instead. Since the current bid is 4 7s, I can bid either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. I have one 8 in my hand, and the previous bid by Player 2 was 3 8s, so bidding 4 8s seems like a safe incremental increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s by Player 4. I need to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. My hand is 72170916, containing zero 8s. The total number of digits is 32, so the expected number of any digit is 3.2. A bid of 4 is slightly above average. Since I have zero 8s, the other 24 digits held by the other 3 players must contain at least four 8s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 8s among those 24 digits is 2.4. Player 2 bid 3 8s earlier this round, and Player 4 raised it to 4 8s. This suggests some strength in 8s between them, making a challenge risky, especially since I hold none. I should consider making a higher bid. Possible bids are 4 9s, 5 0s, 5 1s, etc. My hand contains one 0, two 1s, one 2, one 6, two 7s, and one 9. Bidding based on my strongest digits (1s and 7s) seems best. Bidding 5 1s requires 3 more 1s from the other 24 digits (expected 2.4). Bidding 5 7s requires 3 more 7s from the other 24 digits (expected 2.4). Player 3 bid 4 7s earlier this round, which might indicate they hold some 7s, potentially making 5 7s a safer bid than 5 1s. Therefore, bidding 5 7s seems like the strongest move, leveraging my hand and the recent bidding history.

The expected average count for any digit is 24/10 = 2.4. Since I have two 1s, bidding '3 1s' requires only one more 1 among the other 16 digits held by Player 3 and Player 4. This is statistically likely. It's a safe opening bid based on my hand strength for that digit.

I can either increase the quantity to 4 7s or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity, like 3 8s. Given that I have one 8 in my hand, bidding 3 8s might be safer than increasing the quantity of 7s to 4, as I'm unsure about the distribution of 7s in other hands. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable escalation while staying within a plausible range based on my own digits.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. There are 24 total digits among 3 players. The average count for any digit is 2.4. A bid of 3 is slightly above average, but plausible. I have zero 8s in my hand (72170916), meaning the three 8s must come from the 16 digits held by Player 3 and Player 4. Challenging seems risky as 3 out of 16 is possible. I need to make a higher bid. Options include 3 9s or increasing the quantity. I have two 1s and two 7s. I opened this round with 3 1s. Bidding 4 1s is a logical increase, leverages my hand (two 1s), and is consistent with my previous bid. Bidding 4 7s is also an option based on my two 7s and Player 3's bid of 3 7s, but 4 1s feels like a safer progression.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand has two 1s. The current bid is 4 1s. With 3 players and 8 digits each, the average count for any digit is 2.4. While 4 1s is slightly above average, it's not impossible, especially since Player 5 has already bid on 1s twice this round. Challenging is risky if Player 5 has several 1s. Bidding higher than 4 1s is the safer option. I have two 7s, so bidding 4 7s or 5 7s is reasonable, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same or slightly higher.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 70480726, which contains two 7s. The current bid is 4 7s by Player 3. With a total of 24 digits across all players, it's possible that there are at least 4 7s in play, especially since I contribute two myself. However, I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Bidding higher on 7s (e.g., 5 7s) feels risky given that I only have two, and the likelihood of three more 7s in the remaining 16 digits is uncertain but plausible. Alternatively, I can bid on a different digit. My hand also has two 0s and one 8, but bidding on those might not be as strong. Looking at the bidding history, 7s have been bid on multiple times, and a previous challenge on 5 7s succeeded for the bidder with a count of 6 when there were more digits in play. Now with only 24 digits, 4 7s is plausible but pushing to 5 might be a stretch. I’ll bid 5 7s to test the waters, as it's a moderate increase and aligns with historical success of 7s bids. If challenged, I believe there's a reasonable chance the count holds based on past outcomes.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s by Player 4. I have two 7s in my hand (72170916). This means Player 3 and Player 4 need a combined total of 3 sevens across their 16 cards for the bid to be accurate. The expected number of 7s in those 16 cards is 1.6. However, Player 3 bid 3 7s and 4 7s this round, and Player 4 raised to 5 7s, suggesting they believe there are many 7s. Additionally, in the previous round (32 digits), the actual count of 7s was 6 when I bid 5 7s. Challenging 5 7s seems risky given this history and my own two 7s. I should make a higher bid. Options are 5 8s, 5 9s, or 6 of any digit. I have two 1s in my hand and previously bid 3 1s and 4 1s this round. Player 3 also bid 5 1s in a prior round. Bidding 6 1s is consistent with my previous actions, leverages my hand, and requires 4 ones from the remaining 16 unknown digits (expected 1.6, but plausible given history). This seems safer than escalating the 7s bid or bidding on digits I don't possess.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. With 3 players and 24 total digits, a bid of 6 1s is plausible, but on the higher side. I could challenge, but I have some 1s myself. Bidding higher is also an option. I have two 7s. Bidding 6 7s is a valid higher bid and I have two of that digit, making it more likely to be true. Bidding 7 1s is also a valid higher bid, but I only have two 1s, making 7 1s less likely than 6 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s made by Player 3. In my hand, I have two 7s out of my 8 digits. With three active players and a total of 24 digits, it's possible that there are at least 6 7s across all hands, especially since I contribute 2 to the count. However, the bid of 6 7s feels slightly aggressive given that it requires the other two players to have at least 4 more 7s combined (an average of 2 each out of their 8 digits). Looking at the bidding history, Player 3 has consistently bid on 7s (3 7s, 4 7s, now 6 7s), which might indicate they have a few 7s themselves, increasing the likelihood of the bid being accurate. Additionally, in a previous round, a bid of 5 7s was exceeded with an actual count of 6, though that was with more players. Given the risk of challenging and being wrong (which would eliminate me), and considering I can make a safer bid, I’ll choose to bid higher rather than challenge. I’ll bid 6 8s, as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, and I have one 8 in my hand, making it a plausible bid without overcommitting.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s made by Player 4. There are 24 total digits among the 3 players. My hand (72170916) contains zero 8s. For the bid to be accurate, the other two players (Player 3 and Player 4) must hold at least six 8s between their 16 digits. Statistically, the expected number of 8s in 16 digits is 1.6 (16 * 0.1). Six is significantly higher than the average. Player 4 previously bid 3 8s and now jumped to 6 8s after Player 3 bid 6 7s. This jump seems large, but the final step from 6 7s to 6 8s is minimal, potentially indicating weakness or a bluff. Given I have no 8s to support the bid, the probability of there being 6 or more 8s among the remaining 16 digits is low. Making a higher bid (like 6 9s or 7 of any digit) seems riskier than challenging. Bidding 7 7s might be tempting as I have two 7s and Player 3 bid 7s strongly, but Player 3 stopped at 6 7s, suggesting that might be the limit. Therefore, challenging the high bid of 6 8s is the most logical action.

Player 5 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the round with only two players (Player 3 and myself, Player 5). There are 16 total digits. My hand is 72170916. I have two 1s and two 7s. The expected average count for any digit is 1.6. Starting the bid based on one of my stronger digits is a good strategy. I have two 1s. Bidding '3 1s' is a reasonable opening bid, assuming Player 3 might have at least one 1. This starts the bidding at a plausible level based on my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. My hand is 21710437, which contains two 1s and two 7s. Given there are 16 total digits, an average distribution would be 1.6 of each digit. Player 5 has bid 3 1s. I have two 1s, so Player 5 must have at least one 1 for their bid to be true. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid based on my hand and the current bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s made by Player 3. I hold two 7s in my hand (72170916). For the current bid to be true, Player 3 needs at least one 7 among their 8 digits, which is quite likely. Challenging seems risky, as Player 3 likely bid 3 7s because they hold at least one 7. I need to make a higher bid. Options include 3 8s, 3 9s, or increasing the quantity. Given I have two 7s, bidding 4 7s is a strong possibility. This requires Player 3 to have at least two 7s. Since Player 3 just bid 3 7s, it's plausible they have one or even two 7s. Bidding 4 7s leverages my hand and puts pressure on Player 3 regarding the digit they just bid on. Another option is 4 1s, as I have two 1s, requiring two from Player 3. However, bidding 4 7s seems strategically better as it directly relates to the previous bid and my strong holding in that digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s by Player 5. I have two 7s in my hand. With only two players left and 16 total digits, the average count of any digit is 1.6. Player 5 bidding 4 7s means they likely have at least two 7s themselves, assuming they are bidding somewhat based on their hand. Given I have two 7s, and Player 5 likely has at least two, a total of 4 7s is plausible. However, Player 5's bid of 4 7s follows my bid of 3 7s, which means they increased the quantity. They might be bluffing, or they might have multiple 7s. Since I have two 7s, I'm inclined to believe there are a good number of 7s out there. Challenging 4 7s when I hold two feels risky, as Player 5 could easily hold two or more as well. Bidding higher is necessary. I have two 1s and two 7s. Bidding 5 0s is a safe minimum increase. Bidding 5 1s is a possibility since I have two 1s, but 5 is still above the average. Bidding 5 7s is also an option as I have two 7s. Considering the recent bids have focused on 7s, continuing that trend might be strategic, or it might be predictable. Bidding 5 0s is the lowest valid bid, making it the safest increase if I'm unsure about the higher quantities of my own digits. However, Player 5 just bid 4 7s after I bid 3 7s, suggesting they might have a strong hand in 7s. Challenging is risky. Bidding 5 0s is the safest bid to stay in the game and see what Player 5 does next.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s made by Player 3. I have one 0 in my hand (72170916). For the bid to be true, Player 3 must have at least four 0s among their 8 digits. With only 16 total digits, requiring 5 of a specific digit (nearly 1/3) is becoming statistically less likely. Player 3 switched from bidding 7s (3 7s) to 0s immediately after I raised the bid on 7s (4 7s). This switch could indicate they felt weak on 7s and are potentially bluffing on 0s. Given I hold only one 0, the likelihood of Player 3 holding the required four 0s seems low enough to challenge.
