Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid and I have to start, I'll analyze my hand: 47046863. I count 3 eights and 2 fours, 2 sixes, and 1 seven, 0 other digits. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but not too low. Bidding on a digit I have or is relatively common seems sensible. I'll bid on 4s because I have 2, and it's a moderate digit. Assuming others might have at least one or two 4s, a bid of 5 4s seems like a reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one 4. The current bid is 5 4s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8. A bid of 5 4s is slightly above average, but not unreasonable. However, I have no 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s, or 9s to confidently bid higher on those digits at the same quantity. I do have a 9, so bidding 5 9s is an option, but it's a significant jump. Bidding 6 0s or 6 1s is also possible given my hand, and a safer increase in quantity. Bidding 6 0s seems like a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity by one on a digit I have.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 6 0s, which is quite high given that there are 6 players with 8 digits each. The probability of there being at least 6 zeros across all hands is low, especially since I only have one. Challenging seems like the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have 8 digits in my hand: 5, 3, 9, 8, 6, 4, 0, 1.  There are 5 players remaining, each with 8 digits, for a total of 40 digits. Since I am the first bidder in this round, I need to make an initial bid.  A reasonable starting bid is often based on the expected number of a digit. With 40 total digits, we'd expect an average of 4 of each digit (40 / 10 digits). I have one 0 and one 4 in my hand. Bidding 5 4s or 6 0s seems like a reasonable starting point, slightly above average but not overly aggressive. Given the previous round's history where Player 0 bid 5 4s and Player 1 bid 6 0s, I will choose to bid 6 0s again as it was successful last time.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the probability of there being 6 or more 0s among all players. In my hand, I have one 0. In the previous round, there were 8 zeros total with 6 players (48 digits). Now we have 5 players (40 digits), and Player 2 who was eliminated might have had some 0s. Given that I have one 0, and there were 8 total before, it's reasonable to assume there are still at least 6 zeros total. I could challenge, but the evidence suggests the bid is likely valid. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 4s and one 9 in my hand, but I'll bid conservatively with 6 1s, which keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 80263302, which contains no 1s. The current bid is 6 1s by Player 3. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, an average of 4 of each digit is expected across all hands. A bid of 6 1s is slightly above average but not unreasonable. However, since I have zero 1s in my hand, the likelihood of there being at least 6 1s in the remaining 32 digits seems lower. I could bid higher, such as 6 2s or 7 0s, but I have two 2s and two 0s, which supports a bid on those digits. Still, challenging might be a better option given my lack of 1s. I’ll take the risk and challenge the bid of 6 1s, as it feels unlikely based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round with no current bid to beat, I can start with a conservative bid. My hand is 80263302, which contains two 0s, two 3s, one 2, one 6, and one 8. Since there are 32 total digits across 4 players, I estimate the distribution of digits. Bidding on 0s seems reasonable as I have two in my hand, and it's likely there are a few more among the other players. A bid of 5 0s is a safe starting point, as it is below the maximum plausible count but still sets a decent threshold for others to bid higher or challenge.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. I have the hand 47046863, which contains two 6s and no 2s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have any 2s, I suspect the total count of 2s might be low, making the bid of 6 2s potentially challenging. However, I need to make a bid higher than 6 2s. I can bid 6 3s or higher quantity with a lower or same digit. I see that I have two 6s and two 4s and other digits distributed. Considering the total count and my hand, bidding 6 3s seems reasonable as it increases the digit. Let's analyze if 6 3s is a plausible bid. I have one 3, so there are 7 other players' digits to consider. It's possible that there are 5 more 3s among the remaining 24 digits (since 3 players * 8 digits = 24 digits). Thus, bidding 6 3s is within the realm of possibility.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 6 3s with 32 total digits.  A bid of 6 3s means Player 0 believes there are at least 6 3s among the 32 total digits. With 4 players, the average count per digit is 3.2.  A bid of 6 3s is significantly above average.  Given my hand only has one 3, it's unlikely the other players have enough 3s to reach a total of 6.  Challenging seems like a good move here.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round. I have one of each digit in my hand: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9. With 3 players and 8 digits each, the average count for any digit is 24 / 10 = 2.4. Bidding 3 of any digit is a reasonable starting point. I will choose a digit I have to increase the likelihood of the bid being true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 80263302, which contains two 0s, two 3s, one 2, one 6, one 8, and no 5s. The current bid is 3 5s by Player 1. Since I have no 5s, the bid relies entirely on the other players' hands. With 24 total digits across 3 players, it's possible that there are at least 3 5s in the remaining 16 digits I can't see, but it's not extremely likely. However, challenging now feels risky as the bid is relatively low. I can make a higher bid instead. I have two 0s, so bidding 4 0s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity and changing the digit. This keeps the game moving and tests the other players' confidence in their hands.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. I could bid 4 1s, but that's a weak bid. Given the total number of digits is now only 24, and the bid is only 4, it's probably not a bluff. I'll bid 5 0s to increase the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. With 24 total digits and 3 players, the expected number of any given digit is around 2.4 (24 / 10). A bid of 5 0s is higher than this expectation. However, the previous bid of 6 0s was challenged and the actual count was 8, showing that high counts of 0s are possible. I have one 0, so the other two players would need four 0s between them for the bid of 5 0s to be true. This is plausible, but pushing to 6 0s feels risky with only one 0 in my hand.  A bid of 6 of any digit is a significant jump.  Looking at my hand, I have a 5, a 3, a 9, an 8, a 6, a 4, a 0, and a 1. I have one of each digit. Given the current bid of 5 0s, and my limited information, challenging seems like a reasonable move as 5 of any specific digit is a relatively high bid with only 24 total digits.

A safe starting bid is usually around 1/3 of the total digits for a common digit, or slightly higher for a digit you have multiple of. Since I have one of each, bidding on a digit I have is a good starting point. Bidding 3 of a digit I have is a conservative start.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 80263302, which contains two 0s, one 2, two 3s, one 6, and one 8. The current bid by Player 1 is 3 5s. I have no 5s in my hand, so I must rely on the likelihood of 5s in Player 1's hand. With only 16 total digits remaining, a bid of 3 5s is plausible if Player 1 has at least two or three 5s. However, I can make a higher bid based on my strong count of 0s. Bidding 4 0s is reasonable since I have two 0s, and it's possible Player 1 has at least two more across their 8 digits. This keeps the game moving and avoids an immediate challenge.

A bid of 4 0s is already quite high, implying Player 4 likely has several 0s. Given I only have one 0, bidding higher on 0s is risky. I have one of each digit in my hand. Bidding 4 of any other digit would be a valid higher bid and is a safer bet than raising to 5 0s. Bidding 4 1s is a valid higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 80263302, which contains two 0s, one 8, two 3s, one 6, and two 2s. The current bid is 4 1s by Player 1. In my hand, I have no 1s, so I must rely on Player 1's hand to make up the count. With only 16 total digits (8 mine, 8 theirs), a bid of 4 1s means Player 1 would need to have at least 4 1s in their hand if I have none, which is possible but not highly likely (only 8 digits in their hand). However, challenging now is risky because it's still plausible they have a strong hand of 1s. Instead, I can make a higher bid. I have two 2s, so bidding 4 2s is reasonable, as it increases the digit while maintaining the quantity, and I contribute half of the needed count. This seems safer than challenging at this stage.

With 16 total digits between two players, the expected count for any digit is 1.6.  A bid of 4 2s seems plausible, as Player 4 could have several 2s. I have no 2s. To bid higher, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit.  Increasing the quantity to 5 seems risky given the limited number of digits.  Increasing the digit while keeping the quantity at 4 is a safer option. I have a 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Bidding 4 3s or higher is a valid move. Bidding 4 3s seems reasonable based on the average distribution and the need to make a valid bid.

I have two 3s in my hand, so if Player 1 has at least two 3s, the bid could be valid. However, with only 16 total digits remaining and past bidding history showing aggressive bids, I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Bidding higher to 5 3s or switching to a higher digit like 4 4s feels risky since I have no 4s, and the likelihood of Player 1 having many 3s seems plausible given the history of conservative bids recently. However, I’ll bid higher to 4 8s since I have two 8s myself, making it somewhat safer if challenged, and it increases the digit while maintaining the quantity.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. With 16 total digits, an average distribution would be around 1.6 of each digit. Player 4 bidding 4 8s, which is 2.5 times the average, is a significant jump. While it's possible Player 4 has multiple 8s, bidding 4 8s is a risky move. I have a 9 and a 6 in my hand, which are higher digits. Bidding 5 6s or 5 9s would be a higher bid in terms of quantity, and I have one of each. However, challenging the current bid of 4 8s seems more likely to be successful given the low probability of having four 8s out of 16 digits, especially considering I hold one of them.
