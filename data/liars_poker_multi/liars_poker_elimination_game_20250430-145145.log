Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and need to make the opening bid. My hand is 48971887, which contains three 8s, two 7s, one 1, one 4, and one 9. There are 6 players and 48 total digits, so the expected average count for any digit is 4.8. Having three 8s is a strong starting point, well above the average per hand (0.8). A bid of '5 8s' is statistically reasonable, as it only requires two additional 8s among the other 40 digits held by the other 5 players. This leverages my strongest digit count and sets a plausible but non-trivial opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and it's my turn to make the opening bid. There are 5 players and 40 total digits. The expected count for any digit is 4 (40/10). My hand is 48971887, containing three 8s, two 7s, one 1, one 4, one 9. My strongest suit is 8s. In the previous round (with 48 digits), I successfully bid 5 8s (actual count was 6). Given I still hold three 8s, bidding 5 8s again is a strong opening. I have 3, and needing only 2 more from the remaining 32 hidden digits is statistically plausible (expected number is 4). This bid leverages my hand and sets a reasonably high starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. The current bid is 5 8s, and challenging would succeed only if there are fewer than five 8s across the remaining 32 unknown digits – a situation that still feels close to a coin-flip given Player 0’s confidence last round. Instead, I’ll increase the quantity by one and pivot to a digit I already hold multiple copies of. Needing at least four additional 2s among 32 hidden digits is quite plausible, so this bid is credible while still putting pressure on the table.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '7 7s' and my hand '09934376', I notice that increasing the quantity further might be risky due to the total number of digits remaining (40). However, I also observe that my hand contains a '7', which slightly increases the likelihood of higher bids involving '7s' being valid. Considering the constraints and aiming for a balanced approach, I could either challenge the bid if I think it's unlikely or make a new bid that is strictly higher. Since the current bid is '7 7s', making a higher bid requires either increasing the quantity or bidding on a higher digit with the same or higher quantity. Given the information and the need to make a strictly higher bid, challenging seems less favorable without strong evidence against the bid's validity. Thus, considering my hand and the goal to make a higher bid, I should look for a reasonable increase. However, given the high quantity of '7s' already bid and the total digits remaining, bidding higher on '7s' or any other digit without more information seems risky. The presence of '7' in my hand slightly supports the current bid but doesn't provide enough confidence to increase the quantity of '7s' further without more insight into other players' hands. Therefore, the best course of action, considering the constraints and the aim for strategic advancement, is to carefully evaluate the likelihood of success for each possible bid and consider the challenge option if the bid seems improbable given the total digits and the bidding history.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. I have one 0, two 3s, one 4, one 6, one 7, and one 9 in my hand. Considering the distribution and considering I want to make a reasonable bid without overestimating, I notice I have two 3s which could be a good starting point. Since the total number of digits remaining is 32 and there are 4 players, the average number of any digit across all players would be around 8 (32 digits / 4 players = 8 digits per player, and assuming even distribution across digits 0-9, each digit would appear approximately 8 / 10 = 0.8 times per player). However, this is a very rough estimate and actual counts can vary significantly. Given my hand and the fact that I have two 3s, a bid of 4 3s seems like a cautious yet reasonable starting point, considering the potential for other players to also have 3s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. With 32 total digits remaining, the average expected count for any digit is 3.2. Since I have one 3 in my hand, the expected total count would be approximately 3.4, slightly below the bid. The probability of there being at least 4 3s is estimated around 40%, making challenging a calculated risk. Eliminating Player 4 here could strengthen my position.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, 09934376, I see that I have two 3s and no other digit repeats more than once. Since the goal is to make a valid higher bid and considering I have two 3s, bidding on 3s seems like a reasonable starting point. However, to make the bid more likely to be true and considering the number of total digits remaining (24), I should start with a quantity that is not too high but still takes into account the possibility of other players having the digit. Given the lack of any bids and my hand composition, starting with a lower quantity but a digit I have could be strategic, or I could bid on a digit I have in hopes of it being common enough among players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s, made by Player 4. There are 24 total digits among the 3 players. The expected number of any digit is 2.4. My hand (48971887) contains zero 3s. For the bid to be true, the other two players (Player 2 and Player 4) must hold at least three 3s combined within their 16 digits. The expected number of 3s in those 16 digits is 1.6 (16 * 0.1). Player 4's bid requires almost double the expected number of 3s from the other players' hands. Since I hold none of the bid digit, and the bid requires a significantly above-average count in the remaining digits for an opening bid, challenging seems statistically favorable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 09934376, I notice that I have two 3s and other digits. Since I have to make a bid that is strictly higher than 'None', I should start with a low quantity and a digit that I have in my hand. Bidding on a digit I have increases the likelihood of the bid being valid. I choose to bid on the digit 3 because I have two of them, and starting with a low quantity like 2 makes the bid more likely to be true, considering there are only 16 digits in total and I have 8 of them.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Challenging is not an option because I already hold two 3s, so the current bid of 2 3s is guaranteed to be true. To move the bidding forward with minimal risk, I will keep the quantity at 2 and simply raise the digit. I have one 4 in my hand, so I need only one more 4 in the opponent’s eight unknown digits for the bid to succeed—a likelihood of roughly 57% under uniform assumptions. This is a sensible, low-exposure improvement over the existing bid.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:0 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '2 4s' by Player 2 and my hand '09934376', I notice I have one '4' and one '3', but no other '4's. Since the total number of digits remaining is 16 and we are down to the last two players, each with 8 digits, the maximum number of any digit can be is 8 (if one player has it and the other doesn't) or 16 (if both players have the same digit repeated to its maximum potential). However, given that the bid is for '2 4s', which is relatively low, and considering my hand does contain a '4', it seems plausible that there could indeed be at least two '4s' between us. But I must consider if bidding higher is feasible or if challenging is a better option. Since my hand doesn't give me a clear advantage to bid higher confidently, and given that the current bid is not extremely high, I should consider challenging, especially since the risk of the bid being true is moderate and the reward for challenging a false bid is winning the game.
