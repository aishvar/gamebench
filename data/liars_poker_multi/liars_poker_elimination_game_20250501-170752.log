Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. I have two 6s, one 9, one 3, and one 0 in my hand. A conservative bid would be 1 0s. However, to make a more strategic opening bid, I will bid 1 9s, as I have one in my hand, and it's a relatively high digit which might discourage early challenges.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s made by Player 0. I have two 9s in my hand (from 32441792). Given that there are 6 players and each player has 8 digits, there are a total of 48 digits. With my two 9s, it's possible that other players have at least one 9, making the total count of 9s likely more than 1. However, bidding too high without information could be risky. I can increase the bid moderately based on my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s. To raise, I must increase the quantity. Bidding 4 1s uses a digit I already hold in high count; with 40 unseen digits, the chance that at least one more 1 exists is over 98%, making this a safe and minimal raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I’m the first bidder this round. In my hand I already have three 1s (0,5,1,1,4,5,4,1). With 40 total digits in play, the average count for any digit is about 4, so it’s very likely there is at least one more 1 among the other 32 unseen digits. An opening bid of 4 1s is therefore strong yet believable and leverages my own holdings.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 4 1s. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) based on my possession of two 9s, which suggests potential for more across other hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand (digits: 7, 8, 9, 0, 6, 8, 5, 0). The current bid is 4 9s, which requires at least four 9s among all 40 digits. Since I hold two, there need to be at least two more among the other 32 digits. This is plausible, so challenging is risky. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. I have two 0s as well, so bidding 4 0s is possible, but 4 9s is already a high digit. The safest higher bid is 5 0s, since I have two 0s and 0s are common. This is a reasonable incremental bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 6 0s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have some evidence to support it. Alternatively, I could bid on another digit I have, like 1, 6, or 9. However, increasing the quantity of 0s seems most strategic given the current bid and my hand. Bidding 5 1s would be a valid bid, but 0s seem more likely to be present in other players' hands than, say, 9s.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s made by Player 0. I have 8 secret digits: 3, 2, 4, 4, 1, 7, 9, 2. I see that I have two 4s, but no 0s. Given that the bid is 6 0s and there are 40 total digits, I need to assess if this bid is likely or not. Since I don't have any 0s, I will have to rely on the possibility of other players having 0s. The maximum possible 0s from the other 4 players (excluding me) is 32 (8 digits per player * 4 players). However, bidding 7 0s or higher would be risky without knowing the distribution. I can try to make a safe bid by increasing the digit. I notice I have two 4s, so bidding 3 4s seems reasonable and lower than 6 0s in terms of quantity but higher in digit. However, I need a bid that is strictly higher than 6 0s. Therefore, I should bid 7 1s as there are 1s in my hand and it seems more likely given my digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I already see three 1s in my own hand. Player 1 just jumped the bid to 7 1s, which almost certainly means they hold several 1s themselves (probably 2-4). Combining my three with the likely stash in Player 1’s hand already gets us very close to seven, and the odds that at least one more 1 exists among the remaining 32 hidden digits are high. Rather than challenge a bid that is probably true, I’ll increase the quantity by one while keeping the same digit. Claiming 8 1s feels well-supported by the information available and forces the pressure onto the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The previous challenge revealed 6 total 1s with 6 players. After eliminating Player 3, the maximum possible 1s remaining is 6 (if Player 3 had 0 1s). The current bid of 8 1s exceeds this maximum, making it impossible. Challenging guarantees a win.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. With 32 total digits remaining, the average expected count for any digit is 3.2. Bidding 3 9s leverages my own holdings and statistical probability, making it a safe opening bid that's likely to hold true across all hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 78906850, which contains two 9s. The current bid is 3 9s. With 32 digits in play, it is likely that there are at least three 9s among all hands, so challenging is risky. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 3 but bid a higher digit. I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding 3 8s is likely safe. However, since 'higher' requires increasing the digit if keeping the same quantity, and 9 is the highest digit, my only option is to increase the quantity. I will bid 4 9s, leveraging my two 9s and the probability that at least two more 9s are distributed among the remaining 24 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 5 9s would be a reasonable bluff, as it only increases the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 0 (two 0s). However, given the limited number of total digits (32) and the previous challenge history, bidding higher on 9s seems more plausible than a higher bid on a digit I have more of. A bid of 5 9s is within the realm of possibility, though risky. I'll go with that.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s made by Player 0. I have 8 secret digits: 3, 2, 4, 4, 1, 7, 9, 2. I see that I have one 9 in my hand. Considering the total digits remaining is 32 and there are 4 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. Given that the bid is 5 9s, I need to assess if it's likely or not. Since I only have one 9, and there are 3 other players, the total count of 9s could be higher but also could be lower. I will challenge the bid as it seems high given my information and the limited number of digits.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, meaning it's the start of the round. I have two 6s, one 0, one 9, and two 0s in my hand. Bidding 1 9s is a safe and reasonable starting bid, as I have one 9 and it's a relatively common digit. It's better than bidding on 0 or 6, as I have fewer of those.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s. I have two 9s in my hand, so the total count of 9s is at least two. Since the bid must be strictly higher than 1 9s, the minimum valid bid is 2 of any digit. Bidding 2 9s is logical because I already have two in my hand, making it a truthful bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 78906850, which contains two 9s. The current bid is 2 9s. Since there are 24 digits in play and I have both 9s in my own hand, it's very likely there are more 9s among the other players' hands. Therefore, I should safely increase the bid. The lowest valid bid above 2 9s is 3 9s, which is safe given my hand and the likelihood of more 9s in play.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Given the history of challenges and successful bids, and considering there are only 24 digits left across three players, bidding higher seems risky. I can either bid 4 9s or challenge. Since I only have one 9, challenging seems like the more strategic move. It's unlikely that there are three 9s in the remaining hands, and challenging avoids escalating the bid with a weak hand.

My hand is 78906850, which contains: 7 (1), 8 (2), 9 (1), 0 (2), 6 (1), 5 (1). The most common digits in my hand are 0 and 8, each appearing twice. Opening with a bid on a digit I have multiple of maximizes the chance the total is met. I'll start with '2 0s', as it's a conservative bid and I already have both in my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand (35481995). The current bid of 2 0s requires Player 5 to have at least two 0s in their 8-digit hand. Given the lack of prior bids indicating a high concentration of 0s and the fact that I hold none, challenging this bid is a calculated risk. If Player 5 has fewer than 2 zeros, I win and eliminate them. Since Player 5's bid seems unlikely without supporting evidence, challenging is the optimal move.
