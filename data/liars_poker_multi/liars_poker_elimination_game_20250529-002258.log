Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder with no current bid, I need to make an opening bid based on my hand. I have two 7s, so there are at least two 7s globally, making 'two 7s' a safe and true bid. Choosing a high digit like 7 may pressure subsequent players to increase quantity rather than digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. The current bid of '2 7s' is quite conservative, as it only claims 2 out of a possible 48 digits are 7s. Given I already see one 7 in my hand, it's very likely there is at least one more 7 among the other 40 digits I can't see. I can safely bid '3 7s' to increase the quantity, or make a higher digit bid. Since I have two 9s in my hand, bidding '2 9s' (same quantity but higher digit) would be a safe play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s, which means there needs to be at least one more 9 among the other players' hands. With 5 other players, it's plausible but not certain. I could bid higher, but since the bid is already at 2 9s and I only have one, I think challenging is a reasonable option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, and I won the last round when challenged on '2 9s' which revealed 6 total 9s. While some players were eliminated, this suggests 9s are still common. Starting with a conservative bid like '3 9s' is reasonable given this knowledge and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Given that I have only seen one other 9 so far, it is unlikely that there are three 9s in total. However, challenging might be risky as there are still four other players with unknown digits. I should make a bid that is higher than the current bid. I have two 2s in my hand, so bidding 4 2s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 2s is necessary. I have two 4s, two 6s, two 8s, one 5, and one 9. Bidding 5 4s is a reasonable option, increasing the quantity. Bidding 4 5s or 4 6s would also be possible, but 5 4s seems safest given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 84280763, which contains one 4. The current bid is 5 4s by Player 4. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, an average of 4 of each digit is expected across all hands. I only have one 4, which suggests that the bid of 5 4s might be reasonable if other players have more 4s. However, since it's early in the round and the bid is not excessively high, I can safely make a higher bid. I'll bid 5 5s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, as I have no 5s in my hand but it's a plausible bid based on average distribution.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, making a total of at least five 5s plausible if other players have some. The expected count for digit 5 is around 4, but conditional on my hand, it's approximately 5.2, so challenging is risky. Instead, I can make a higher bid by keeping the quantity at 5 and increasing the digit to 7, as I have two 7s, supporting a bid of 5 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, and the current bid is '5 7s'. With 5 players total and 8 digits each (40 total), having 5 sevens is plausible. However, I can see that only 1 of the 5 claimed sevens is in my hand. For the bid to be true, the other 4 players would need to have an average of 1 seven each, which is possible but getting unlikely. Given that Player 0 raised to this level and I can only see one 7, I think there's a good chance they're bluffing. Additionally, the bidding has escalated quickly in quantity, suggesting possible aggressive play. A challenge here has good odds of success.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and have good information about my hand. I see one 9, one 6, two 2s, and one 7. From the previous rounds, I know there were at least 6 9s in the game when there were 48 total digits, and at least 4 2s when there were 40 digits. Even with fewer players now, starting with a conservative bid of 3 2s seems safe since I alone have two 2s in my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s and one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s. Since I have one 2, it is possible that there are at least 3 2s in total. However, bidding higher on 2s is risky. I have two 9s, so bidding 4 9s seems reasonable since there are already 6 9s in play, making it more likely that there are at least 4 9s in total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand. Given the previous rounds, players seem willing to bid high. Bidding 5 9s is risky as it's a high number and I have no 9s. However, bidding 4 10s is impossible. I can bid 5 0s, 5 1s, 5 2s, 5 3s, 5 4s, 5 5s, 5 6s, 5 7s, or 5 8s. I have two 4s, two 6s, two 8s and one 5. Bidding 5 8s is the most reasonable option, as I have two 8s and it's a significant increase in quantity from the previous bid. It is still a gamble, but justified given the game state.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 84280763, which contains two 8s. The current bid by Player 4 is 5 8s. With 32 total digits across 4 players, it's possible but not highly likely that there are 5 or more 8s in total, especially since I only have 2. The bidding history shows aggressive bids, with Player 4 escalating from 4 9s to 5 8s. Given that I have a reasonable number of 8s, I think the bid might hold, so I will make a higher bid of 5 9s to test the waters and avoid an immediate challenge. This keeps the game moving and puts pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I can see my hand contains one 9. The current bid claims there are 5 nines total among 32 digits (4 players × 8 digits). Given that I only have one 9, and it's unlikely for the remaining players to have many 9s (would need 4 more among 24 remaining digits), this bid seems risky. Additionally, Player 5 increased the digit from 8s to 9s while keeping the same quantity, which could indicate they don't have many 9s themselves. Based on these factors and the relatively high quantity claimed, challenging is the safer option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 84280763, which gives me digits to work with. I have two 8s, which is a reasonable starting point for a bid. Given that there are 24 total digits across three players, a bid of 3 8s seems plausible as an opening bid. It is not too high to be immediately challenged and leverages the strength of having two 8s in my hand. This bid also sets a moderate threshold for the next players to either raise the quantity or the digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s by Player 5. Given that there are only 24 digits remaining across 3 players, it's plausible that there could be 3 8s. However, bidding higher on 8s is risky. I have two 9s, so bidding 4 9s is a safer and higher bid than 3 8s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Player 3 bid 4 9s. Given the history of challenges and wins, and the limited number of digits remaining (24 total), a bid of 4 9s seems plausible, but not overwhelmingly so. However, I have two 8s. Bidding 5 8s is a reasonable increase in quantity and could be successful, but it's risky. Considering the previous challenges and the fact that I have no 9s, I believe challenging is the better play. The risk of Player 3 having four 9s is lower than the risk of Player 5 or I having five 8s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand, and there are 16 digits remaining in total. If Player 5 has any 9s, it is likely that there are at least 4 9s in total across both hands. Bidding 4 9s is a reasonable starting bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 84280763, which contains no 9s. The current bid by Player 3 is 4 9s, meaning there must be at least 4 nines across the total 16 digits between us. Since I have none, all 4 nines would need to be in Player 3's hand of 8 digits, which is possible but not highly likely (about a 5.6% chance if digits are random). However, looking at the bidding history, Player 3 has bid on 9s before, and previous rounds showed counts of 9s being at least 4 or 5. Given this, it's plausible they have a few 9s. I could challenge, but the risk is high since if they have 4 or more, I lose. Instead, I’ll make a safer bid of 5 0s, increasing the quantity, as I have one 0 in my hand, and it's reasonable to assume there could be more in Player 3's hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand and the current bid is 5 0s. I do not have any 0s in my hand, but I have two 9s. I know that there are at least 4 9s based on previous bids. I can bid 6 9s, which is a reasonable increase in quantity and uses a digit that I know exists in multiple hands. However, I do not know if Player 5 has any 0s. It is possible that they do not, and if they do not, they cannot make a higher bid. I should challenge.
