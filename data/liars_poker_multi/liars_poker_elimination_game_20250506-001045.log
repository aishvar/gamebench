Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in a new round with 6 players and 48 total digits. My hand is 82593751, which contains two 5s. Bidding on a digit I have multiple of is a common strategy for the first bid. Bidding '3 5s' is a valid starting bid, slightly higher than my own count, and a plausible quantity for the total number of 5s across all players at this stage of the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 44866569, I have no 5s. However, with 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total), having 3 fives across all players is quite reasonable (about 4.8 expected). Since I have two 6s in my hand, I can confidently bid '3 6s', which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is supported by my own hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I don't have any 6s in my hand. I could bid 3 7s, but I don't have any 7s either. I could bid 4 of any digit. I will bid 4 0s, as I have one 0 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 0s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, having 4 total 0s is quite reasonable. Since I alone have 2 zeros, it's very likely there are at least 2 more among the other 5 players (40 remaining digits). I should continue bidding. I can either increase the quantity to 5 0s or bid 4 with a higher digit. Since 5 0s might be pushing it given I only know about my two, I'll bid 4 1s, which I know is safer since I have a 1 in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s made by Player 3. I have two 1s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my goal is to make a higher bid and I have two 1s, bidding 5 1s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 4 2s or higher if I think 1s are overrepresented. Given my hand and the need to make a strictly higher bid, I will increase the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 1 and two 6s in my hand. The current bid of 5 1s requires at least 4 more 1s in the other 40 digits, which is slightly above the expected count of 3.8. However, bidding 5 6s is a stronger move since I hold two 6s and the expected total of 6s across all players is ~4.8, making this bid credible.

Player 5 bids: 5 6s

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:5 - openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand. With 48 total digits among 6 players, the expected count for any digit is 4.8. Given I have no 6s, the other 5 players must have at least 5 6s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 6s among the other 5 players (40 digits) is 4. Based on probability (Binomial distribution B(40, 0.1)), the chance of having 5 or more 6s among the other 5 players is approximately 37%, while the chance of having less than 5 6s is approximately 63%. Challenging the bid has a higher probability of winning based on these odds and my hand composition.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and in the previous round's challenge, the total count of 6s was 6 across all players. With Player 0 eliminated, the remaining players likely still have at least 4 6s in total. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable starting bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I can see two 6s in my own hand (44866569). Given there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total), and the previous round revealed at least 6 sixes when there were 48 digits, it's very likely there are at least 4 sixes total. The current bid of '4 6s' by Player 5 seems quite reasonable based on this information. I should make a higher bid. Since I'm confident about sixes, I'll increase to '5 6s'.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 8s, and I can bid higher. I'll bid 6 0s, which is a valid bid that increases the quantity and changes the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. With 5 players and 8 digits each (40 total), Player 2's bid of 6 0s means there need to be at least 4 more 0s among other players' hands. While possible, this seems unlikely given the aggressive bidding pattern. Also, in the previous round, there were 6 6s total, suggesting players tend to have varied digits. With only 2 0s in my hand out of the claimed 6, I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand and two 8s and one 1. Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a low bid. Bidding 1 0 seems safe and allows me to gather information.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s made by Player 2. I have two 0s in my hand, which already accounts for 2 of the 0s. Given that there are 4 active players and each has 8 secret digits, there are a total of 32 digits. With my two 0s, there are 30 digits left. Assuming the worst-case scenario where Player 2 has 0 0s (which is possible but not likely since they bid 1 0s), the remaining 3 players could potentially have up to 30 0s. However, bidding 2 0s seems reasonable given my information and the need to increase the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, making the current bid of 2 0s possible if another player holds at least one 0. However, since I have two 6s, bidding 2 6s is a safe and truthful move that leverages my hand's strength while legally surpassing the current bid. This bid avoids risking a challenge on Player 4's bid, which could be valid given the potential distribution of zeros.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand (44866569). Given there are 4 players with 8 digits each (32 total), and the current bid is only '2 6s', this is a very safe bid to raise. Since I alone have 2 sixes, there are likely more among other players. Based on previous rounds, Player 5 has shown confidence in 6s before. I'll increase to '3 6s' which should be quite safe given my knowledge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. I could bid 4 0s, but that might be risky since I don't know how many 0s are out there. Bidding 4 6s is safer if I want to bid, but I am not confident there are four 6s. I will bid 4 0s, as it is the lowest possible valid bid.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s made by Player 2. I have two 0s in my hand. Given that there are 3 other active players, the total number of 0s could reasonably be higher than 4, especially considering that each player has 8 digits. However, I also need to consider the likelihood of higher bids. Since my hand contains two 0s and the bid is 4 0s, bidding 5 0s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid with a higher digit if I have it. My hand is 03687955, so I have no other digits that appear more than twice. Bidding 5 0s seems like a safe increase based on my hand and the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid of 5 0s requires at least five 0s across all four players' hands. I have one 0 in my hand, so there must be at least four more among the other three players. Given that the average expected count for any digit in 32 total digits is ~3.2 and the previous elimination rounds suggest cautious bidding, a bid of 5 0s seems statistically unlikely. Challenging this bid carries a calculated risk, especially since Player 4's aggressive jump from 2 0s to 5 0s might overstate their position.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With 24 total digits across three players, bidding 3 6s is a logical starting point since it leverages my existing cards and assumes at least one more 6 exists among the other players. This bid follows the hierarchy rules (quantity/digit) and sets a moderate baseline for the round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand (44866569). The current bid of 3 6s by Player 5 is actually quite reasonable given that I can see two of them. Since there are only 3 players left with 8 digits each (24 total), and I know about my two 6s, making a bid of 4 6s would be risky as it would require finding two more 6s between the other two players. A challenge here would be dangerous since finding just one more 6 between two players (16 digits) is quite likely. I should make a conservative higher bid by keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit to 7s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. I could bid 3 8s, 3 9s, or 4 of any digit. Since I have two 8s, bidding 3 8s seems like a reasonable and safe option.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I hold one 8 in my hand. With 24 total digits across 3 players, the average expected count for any digit is ~2.4. Given that I have one 8, the remaining two players would need at least two more 8s to satisfy the bid. Using probability modeling, the chance of the other players holding ≥2 8s is ~48.6%, making the bid slightly more likely to fail. Challenging seems statistically favorable.

Player 1 Reasoning: I can see my entire hand (44866569) and there is only 1 eight in it. Since there are only 2 players left with 8 digits each, and Player 2 claims there are at least 2 eights total, they must have at least 1 eight in their hand for their bid to be true. While this is possible, I could make a higher bid like '2 9s' since I have a 9 in my hand. However, making a higher bid would be risky as I don't have strong evidence for more 9s. Since I only see 1 eight and the bid requires 2, and the opponent has shown aggressive bidding behavior, challenging now is the safer play.
