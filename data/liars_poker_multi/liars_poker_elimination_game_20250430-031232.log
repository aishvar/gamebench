Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player to bid, I need to make a reasonable opening bid. I have two 7s in my hand, which is a relatively strong starting point. A bid of 3 7s is slightly above my own count but is a plausible quantity across 6 players with 48 total digits. Bidding 3 7s is a safe and strategic opening move.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 61487166, which contains one 7. The current bid is 3 7s by Player 0. With 6 players and 48 total digits, it's plausible that there are at least 3 7s across all hands, as each player could have a few. Since I have one 7, it's not unreasonable. However, I need to make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity to 4 or more for any digit, or keep the quantity at 3 and bid a higher digit like 8s or 9s. My hand has two 6s and two 1s, but no 8s or 9s. Bidding 4 6s feels safer since I have two 6s myself, making it more likely that there are at least two more 6s among the other 40 digits. Challenging 3 7s seems risky as it's a low bid and likely to be true. Therefore, I'll bid 4 6s to increase both the quantity and shift to a digit I'm stronger in.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I could bid 5 6s, or 4 of a higher number. Since I have two 8s, bidding 4 8s seems like a safer option than bidding 5 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits. The expected average count for any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8. The bid of 4 8s is slightly below this average, making it statistically plausible. I have zero 8s in my hand (23476791), which means the other 5 players (40 digits) must hold at least four 8s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 8s among those 40 digits is 40 * 0.1 = 4. Challenging seems risky as the bid is very close to the expected value. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 7s. Player 0 previously bid 3 7s. Bidding 5 7s leverages my hand's strength. It requires three more 7s among the remaining 40 digits, which is statistically reasonable (4 expected). This seems like a better option than the minimal bid of 4 9s (where I only have one 9).

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With 40 unknown digits and an average of 4 8s among them, a total of 5 8s is quite plausible (~78% chance). Bidding 5 8s is valid (same quantity, higher digit) and strong.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s by Player 4. Given my hand (2, 3, 0, 7, 7, 8, 5, 1), I have only one 8. It is highly unlikely that there are at least 5 eights across all players since only one 8 exists in my hand and no other information suggests more. Challenging this bid is the safest move to avoid losing if the bid is false.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits, I expect about 3.2 more 8s (total ~5.2). The probability of at least 4 eights is over 80%, making “4 8s” a safe opening bid that leverages my information and pressures the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains zero 8s. The current bid is 4 8s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4 (40 / 10 digits).  Player 4 just bid 4 8s, which is exactly the average.  While it's possible there are four 8s, I have no information to support it and the previous round showed a higher-than-average count of 8s (6). Since I have no 8s, challenging seems risky as the average is 4 and the previous round had 6.  Bidding higher is necessary. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 5 7s is a valid higher bid, increasing the quantity while using a digit I have.  Bidding 5 8s is also a valid higher bid, but I have no 8s, making it more of a bluff. Bidding 5 7s is a safer bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 61487166, which contains one 7. The current bid is 5 7s by Player 0. With 40 total digits across 5 players, it's possible that there are at least 5 7s in play, especially since I only have one. However, the previous bids show a pattern of increasing cautiously, and 5 7s is a moderate bid. I could challenge, but the risk is high since it's plausible. Instead, I'll make a higher bid of 6 7s to push the limit slightly, testing if others believe there are more 7s. If they challenge, I only have one 7, so it's risky for me if the count is low, but it might pressure others to reveal information.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have one 8 in my hand. I could bid 7 0s, which is a safe but potentially weak bid. Given the game history, 7s seem to be a popular digit. I'll bid slightly higher to stay in the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. The expected average count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. My hand (23476791) contains zero 0s. This means the remaining 32 digits held by the other 4 players must contain at least seven 0s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 0s in those 32 digits is 3.2. Requiring 7 0s from the other 32 digits is statistically unlikely (more than double the average). Additionally, Player 2 jumped from the previous bid of 6 7s, changing the digit entirely, which could indicate a bluff or an attempt to steer away from a heavily bid digit. Given I hold no 0s and the statistical improbability, challenging is the best course of action.

Player 3 Reasoning: I am Player 3 and it's my turn to start the bidding. There are 4 active players, each with 8 digits, for a total of 32 digits. The expected average count for any digit is 3.2 (32/10). My hand is 23476791. I have two 7s, which is my most frequent digit. Starting the bid based on my strongest digit is a common strategy. A bid of '3 7s' is reasonable: I hold two 7s, and statistically, it's likely there's at least one more 7 among the other 24 digits held by the other three players. This bid is slightly above the expected average but supported by my hand, making it a safe but informative opening bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand and no 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, which is plausible but I can safely increase the digit without raising the quantity by bidding 3 8s. With two 8s in my hand, only one more is needed among the other 24 cards, which is very likely.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 75317924, which contains one 8. The current bid is 3 8s. With 32 total digits among 4 players, the average count of any digit is 3.2. While 3 8s is a plausible bid, I have an 8, making it more likely. I can bid 4 7s as I have two 7s, which is a higher quantity than the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 61487166, so I have two 7s. The current bid is 4 7s by Player 0. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 4 7s is plausible since it’s only 12.5% of the total digits, and I contribute 2 of them. I don’t think challenging is wise yet as the bid isn’t excessively high. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. I can bid 5 7s to increase the quantity. This seems reasonable given my two 7s, and it pushes the bid higher without being too aggressive. Alternatively, bidding on a different digit like 6s (where I also have two) could work, but sticking with 7s leverages my current contribution. I’ll go with 5 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s made by Player 1. I hold two 7s (in hand 23476791). The bidding history for this round shows increasing confidence in 7s: I started with 3 7s, Player 0 raised to 4 7s, and Player 1 raised to 5 7s. This suggests Player 0 likely has at least one 7, and Player 1 likely has at least one or two 7s to justify their bid over Player 0's. Combining my two 7s with the likely 7s held by Player 0 and Player 1, the count of 5 7s seems highly plausible, making a challenge risky. The next logical bid is either 6 7s or 5 8s/5 9s. Given the focus on 7s and my own hand, increasing the quantity to 6 7s seems like the most informed move. It requires only one additional 7 among the other 24 digits beyond what seems necessary for the current bid of 5, which is statistically reasonable (expected number of 7s is 3.2 out of 32).

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 75317924. I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s. With 3 players and 24 total digits, a bid of 3 8s represents a density of 3/24 = 1/8.  A random distribution would suggest an average of 24/10 = 2.4 of each digit. The previous player bid 3 8s, which is slightly above average but not unreasonable.  I have one 8.  To bid higher, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit.  Increasing the quantity to 4 8s feels risky given I only have one 8.  Bidding 3 9s is a valid move and slightly increases the bid while not requiring a high count of 8s. I have one 9, so bidding 3 9s is plausible.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 61487166, which contains no 9s. The current bid is 3 9s by Player 0. With only 24 total digits across three players, and knowing I have zero 9s, the likelihood of there being at least 3 9s in the remaining 16 digits is possible but not extremely high. However, since the bid is relatively low (only 3), it’s plausible that the other two players could have enough 9s between them. Instead of challenging, I’ll make a higher bid to keep the game moving and avoid the risk of losing a challenge. I have three 6s in my hand, so bidding 4 6s feels reasonable as it increases the quantity and I have a decent contribution to the count.

Given the history and the reduced number of digits, bidding 5 6s seems risky, as it would require four 6s in Player 1's hand or a significant bluff. Bidding 4 7s is a safe increase based on my two 7s, and it is a valid higher bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 61487166, which contains two 7s. The current bid by Player 0 is 4 7s, meaning there should be at least 4 sevens across both hands (16 digits total). Since I have 2 sevens, Player 0 would need at least 2 sevens in their hand for the bid to hold. This is possible, but with only 2 players left, I can take a risk to push the bid higher. I will bid 5 7s, as I know at least 2 sevens exist in my hand, and it's a reasonable increase to pressure Player 0 into challenging or bidding higher.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. With 16 total digits, an average count for any digit is 1.6. A bid of 5 7s is significantly above this average.
