Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 4 in my hand. Considering the game has just started and there's no previous bid, bidding 1 4s seems like a reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand, so the total count of 4s across all players is at least 2. Since the current bid is 1 4s, bidding 2 4s is a safe and logical increase based on my hand. Challenging would be unwise because the existing bid is guaranteed to be valid (I already have two 4s), which would eliminate me.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have three 4s in my hand (digits: 8,7,3,5,7,2,7,3). Since I hold three 4s, I could bid 3 4s to increase the quantity, which is within the total possible count of 48. Bidding 3 4s seems a reasonable escalation, given my hand and the previous bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have a 5 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 4s. Bidding 3 5s is a valid higher bid as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This leverages my existing card and follows the rules for increasing the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. Bidding 4 4s exceeds the current bid of 3 5s (since quantity 4 > 3), and needing just one more 4 among the other 40 digits is very likely. It's a safe raise based on my hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have 8 secret digits: 0, 4, 8, 5, 1, 3, 1, 5. I can see that I have one 4 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains one 4, bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit seems reasonable. I will bid 5 4s as it is a straightforward increase in quantity and I have a 4 in my hand to support this bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s, and I have two 4s in my hand. I should increase the quantity to 6, as it's the highest possible quantity without exceeding the total digits remaining.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid of 6 4s is above the expected average of 4.8 4s across all hands. I have two 4s in my hand, meaning the remaining 40 digits across 5 other players would need to contain at least four more 4s. Given the bidding history and the risk of overestimating the distribution of 4s, challenging the bid is statistically favorable since the probability of the bid being true is likely below 50%.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None. With no previous bid to compare to, I should start by bidding on a digit that appears in my hand. My hand includes two 6s, so bidding on 6s seems reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:5 - gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s, and I need to bid higher. My hand contains the digits 8, 7, 3, 5, 7, 2, 7, 3. Counting the 6s in my hand, I have zero. Since the maximum total is 40, and previous bids show that 2 6s is plausible, I can safely challenge if I believe the total number of 6s is less than 2. Given I have no 6s and considering the previous bid is just 2 6s, it's unlikely that the total across all players is 2 or more. Challenging seems the best move to eliminate the current bidder and possibly win if the count is indeed less than 2.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I can make any bid I want. I have two 6s in my hand, so I should start with a reasonable bid. Bidding 2 6s seems a good starting point.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains two 7s, which allows me to bid 2 7s, a valid higher bid than the current 2 6s. This maintains the same quantity but increases the digit, aligning with my hand's composition.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand, guaranteeing at least three 4s across all 32 digits. The current bid is 2 7s, so I need to increase the quantity or digit. Bidding 3 4s increases the quantity and is guaranteed true, protecting me from a challenge.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s made by Player 4. I have the digits 0, 4, 8, 5, 1, 3, 1, 5 in my hand, which means I have one 4. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 32 total digits remaining, bidding too high would risk being challenged and losing. Since my hand contains one 4, and the current bid is 3 4s, I can reasonably bid higher than 3 4s. I will bid 4 4s, increasing the quantity.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s made by Player 5. I have 4 digits in my hand, but none of them are 4. However, I have a 6 and a 0, and I previously bid 2 6s. Considering the previous bids and my hand, it seems reasonable to bid higher on a different digit, so I'll bid 2 7s.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid that reflects my cards. Bidding 2 9s is logical as it directly corresponds to the count of 9s I hold, and it's a valid starting point for the round.

Player 4 Reasoning: I hold three 4s in my hand. By bidding 3 4s I’m guaranteed the total count is at least 3, so any challenge would fail. This is the minimal valid increase over 2 9s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s made by Player 4. I have the digits 0, 4, 8, 5, 1, 3, 1, 5 in my hand, which means I have two 4s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and there are only 3 players left with 8 digits each (total of 24 digits), bidding a high quantity is risky. However, I can see that bidding 4 4s would be a reasonable increase in quantity based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have one 4 in my hand, but the total count of 4s across all players could be as low as 1 (if others have none). However, bidding 4 5s (same quantity, higher digit) is a valid move. I have a 5 in my hand, making this bid plausible. This increases the digit, which may pressure others to either challenge or bid higher, avoiding an immediate challenge on an uncertain bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. With 16 total digits and an expected ~0.8 additional 4s in my opponent’s 8 cards, bidding 4 4s is plausible (~57% chance) and makes a challenge unattractive.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s made by Player 4. I have the hand 04851315, which contains two 4s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, I should consider the possibility of challenging or bidding conservatively. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I notice that bidding 5 4s would be a straightforward increase in quantity, but I must assess if it's reasonable given my hand and the total digits available.
