Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player to bid, I need to make a reasonable starting bid. My hand contains two 6s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8. Bidding 3 6s is a conservative yet plausible starting bid based on my hand and the total number of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. My hand contains no 6s, and the total count of 6s across all players' hands is uncertain. However, since the bid is relatively low (3 6s) and I have no 6s, challenging the bid could be a viable option if I believe the actual count is less than 3. However, without knowing other players' hands, this is speculative. Alternatively, bidding a higher digit (e.g., 3 7s) would be a safer move to avoid immediate risk.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. Player 1 bid 3 7s. Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable move to increase the quantity while keeping the digit the same. This bid is likely valid given the remaining digits and the current bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s, which means there are at least 3 more 7s among the other 5 players (40 digits). Given that the probability of having 3 more 7s in 40 digits is moderate, but not extremely high, I can either bid higher or challenge. Since bidding higher would require going to 5 7s or 4 8s, which is risky, I choose to challenge the current bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The previous round showed there were only 2 7s in total, and now with one less player, the likelihood of 7s is even lower. Starting with a moderate bid on a digit I have in my hand seems safe, so I'll bid on 1s, which I have two of.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. My hand is 76165128, which contains one 1. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in total. The bid of 2 1s seems reasonable as it is a low quantity. I have one 1, so the total count of 1s must be at least 1. I can make a higher bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I will increase the quantity to 3 and keep the digit the same, making it 3 1s.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s made by Player 4. I have one 1 in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are 40 digits in total. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Since I need to make a bid strictly higher than 3 1s, I should consider bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit. Bidding 4 1s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity, but given I only have one 1, I might not want to risk challenging on a higher quantity without more information. However, bidding a higher digit with a low quantity could be strategic. I have a 3, 6, and other digits that could be considered. Bidding 3 3s seems like a safe bet as it matches the quantity but increases the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. My hand contains two 1s. With 40 total digits among 5 players, the expected count for any digit is 4. My two 1s make a higher count of 1s likely. Bidding 4 1s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity than 3 3s) and is well-supported by my hand and the expected distribution of digits. Challenging 3 3s is risky as it's a low bid close to the average expectation, and I have one 3 myself.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 4 1s. Bidding 4 4s is a valid higher bid, as it maintains the same quantity but increases the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 4 4s, which means there needs to be at least 3 more 4s among the other 4 players (32 digits). Given that the previous bid was 4 1s and the round has seen aggressive bidding, it's possible that the count of 4s is being overestimated. I should challenge this bid as it seems unlikely to be true.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have the digits 76165128, which includes two 1s and no 4s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 4s, I suspect the total count of 4s might be low, but I should still consider the information from previous rounds and the fact that there are 32 digits in total. Bidding 2 5s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit, making it a higher bid. However, I should also consider the likelihood of the count of 5s being higher than 2.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s made by Player 4. I have the digits 0, 4, 3, 2, 6, 0, 3, 9 in my hand. I see that there are 32 total digits remaining across 4 players, which means 8 digits per player. I have one 0 and no 5s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are only 4 players left, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. Since I do not have any 5s, I will not try to increase the bid on 5s. I will bid on a digit that I have, which is 0, and I have two of them. Bidding 3 0s seems like a reasonable and safe bet as it is higher than 2 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. With 32 total digits, the expected number of 0s is around 3.2. Challenging 3 0s means I win if the total count is 0, 1, or 2. Given I have one 0, this requires the other 3 players (with 24 digits) to have zero or one 0. The expected number of 0s in 24 digits is 2.4, so having 2 or more is likely. Challenging seems unfavorable. My hand contains two 1s. Bidding 4 1s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and is well supported by my hand (I have 2, need 2 more from 24 digits; expected count in 24 digits is 2.4). This is a reasonable and safe bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 4s. The current bid is 4 1s. Bidding 4 4s is a valid higher bid since the digit 4 is higher than 1, maintaining the same quantity. This leverages my existing digits while adhering to the bidding rules.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. My hand is 76165128, which contains two 1s and no 4s or higher digits that are relevant to the current bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have information about my own hand, I can count my digits. I have no 4s, so the total count of 4s must come from the other players. The bid of 4 4s is plausible because there are 3 other players. I will increase the digit to make a higher bid. Bidding 4 5s is a valid move because it's a higher digit with the same quantity.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s made by Player 4. I have a 0, 3, 6, and 9 in my hand. Given that there are 32 total digits remaining and 4 active players with 8 digits each, I should assess the likelihood of there being at least 4 5s. Since my hand does not have any 5s, and I do not know the distribution of other players' hands, I must consider the plausibility of higher bids or challenging. Bidding higher than 4 5s, I could bid on a digit I have. Bidding 5 0s seems reasonable as I have three 0s and it's a higher quantity than 4.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. Challenging is risky because Player 5 likely has multiple 0s, as indicated by their bids of 3 0s and 5 0s in this round. I must bid higher. I have two 1s in my hand. Bidding 5 1s is a valid increase (same quantity, higher digit) and is a plausible bid given my hand and the total number of digits remaining. It also follows my previous bid of 4 1s in this round, maintaining consistency.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. My hand contains no 1s, and with 32 total digits remaining, it's uncertain if there are at least 5 ones across all players. Challenging this bid is a logical risk, as the actual count might be lower than 5, which would eliminate Player 0 and give me an advantage.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s made by Player 4. My hand contains one 6 and I have a total of 8 digits. Given that there are 3 active players and 24 total digits remaining, I should assess the likelihood of there being at least 2 6s in total. Since I only have one 6, the other two players must have at least one 6 between them for the bid to be valid. I also notice that bidding 3 0s would be a safe bet as my hand contains two 0s and it's highly plausible that other players have at least one 0. However, I must make a bid that is strictly higher than 2 6s. Bidding 3 6s seems risky since I only have one 6. Therefore, I should either bid higher with a different digit or challenge if I think the bid is unlikely.

Since I don't have any 4s, I think 3 4s might be a bit low, but I also don't have information about other players' hands. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit. Alternatively, bidding 4 4s is also valid as it increases the quantity. Given that I have some digits that are higher than 4 and my hand doesn't contain any 4s, I will choose to bid 4 4s, as it is a safer increase in quantity rather than just increasing the digit.

Given that my hand has one 4 and there are 24 total digits left, I need to assess if bidding higher is reasonable or if challenging is more strategic. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and there are only 3 players left, bidding 5 0s seems aggressive but possible if I consider my three 0s and the possibility that others might have some 0s as well.
