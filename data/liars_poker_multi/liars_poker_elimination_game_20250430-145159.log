Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 72416979, which gives me two 7s, two 9s, and one each of 2, 4, 1, and 6. Starting with a conservative bid based on my hand, Iâ€™ll bid on the digit 7 since I have two of them. A bid of 3 7s seems reasonable as an opening bid, assuming at least one other 7 might exist among the other 40 digits across the remaining players.

Player 1 Reasoning: Player 0 bid 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable increase in quantity. Since I have a 7, it's likely there are at least 3 more 7s among the other players' hands, making this a safe bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand, making 5 2s a plausible bid given the expected total of 2s across all players' hands. Bidding 5 2s increases the quantity from the current 4 7s and leverages my strong holding in 2s, which statistically supports the bid's validity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 twos. I have one '2' in my hand. The previous bids increased quantity from 3 to 4 sevens, then Player 2 bid 5 twos. Since the current bid is 5 2s, I need to bid higher. I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 5 and increase the digit. I have no other twos, so bidding 6 of any digit may be risky. I have one '9' in my hand, so bidding 5 9s is a valid increment and plausible. It increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This seems like a reasonable bid given my hand and the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have the digits 3, 5, 5, 1, 3, 9, 1, 1 in my hand. Counting the 9s, I only have one 9, so the total across all players is unlikely to reach 5. Challenging the bid seems prudent since the likelihood of there being at least 5 nines in total is very low, given my hand and typical distributions. Bidding higher would be risky and unlikely to succeed, so I will challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have the digits 1, 8, 1, 4, 6, 5, 2, 9 in my hand, which includes two 1s and one each of 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Since there are 40 digits total and no bids yet, a safe starting bid would be a moderate quantity with a digit I have multiple of, such as '2 1s'. This is a reasonable opening that is not too aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 72416979, which contains one 6. The current bid is 3 6s by Player 5. With 5 players and 40 total digits, it's plausible that there are at least 3 6s across all hands, as each player could have a few. I don't have strong evidence to challenge this bid since my single 6 contributes to the count, and it's early in the round with conservative bidding so far. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 4 9s feels reasonable, increasing both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 3 6s. This keeps the pressure on others while staying within a believable range based on my own hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Given that there are 40 digits remaining and 5 players, it's plausible that there could be 4 9s in total. However, bidding higher on 9s is risky. I have two 6s in my hand, and considering the previous bid of 3 6s, bidding 5 6s seems like a safer and reasonable increase in both quantity and digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid of 5 6s requires at least five 6s in total. I have one 6 in my hand, leaving only 32 digits across four other players. The average total number of 6s across all hands would be ~4 (40 digits / 10 digits = 4 per digit). Since my hand already contains one 6, the remaining players would need to have four more 6s in their combined hands for the bid to be valid. Given the average distribution and my limited information, this seems unlikely. Challenging is the optimal move.

Player 1 Reasoning: Although there is no current bid, I have one 9 in my hand, and there are 32 digits remaining across 4 players. Bidding 5 9s is reasonable, as it's a high digit and a moderate quantity, and it's likely that at least 5 9s exist among all players' hands. Additionally, it sets a relatively high bar for the next player, which may encourage a challenge if they think it's unlikely.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Given there are 32 digits in total, having at least 5 nines is plausible but somewhat high. To increase the bid, I must either raise the quantity or keep the quantity and raise the digit. The next valid bids are 5 0s (digit 0 is higher than 9?), but digits go 0-9, so after 9 we must increase quantity. So I can bid 6 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, so bidding 6 0s is a reasonable raise, considering the total digits and my hand. Therefore, I will bid 6 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s made by Player 5. In my hand of 72416979, I have no 0s, which means I contribute nothing to the count of 0s. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 7 0s means that on average, each player would need to have about 1.75 0s in their hand. While this is statistically possible, it feels slightly high given I have none. However, since I lack information about other players' hands and the bid isn't outrageously high (like 10 or more), challenging might be risky. Instead, Iâ€™ll make a safer bid by increasing the quantity to 8 and choosing a digit I have some of in my hand, like 9s, since I have two 9s. Bidding 8 0s would be too speculative without any 0s myself. Thus, Iâ€™ll bid 8 9s to shift the focus to a digit I can support slightly.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Considering there are 24 digits total across all players, and 6 is a mid-range digit, it is plausible that there are at least 4 sixes in total. To raise the bid, I must increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. I can bid 4 7s or 5 0s or higher. Since 7 is just one digit higher and the quantity remains the same, bidding 4 7s is a reasonable and safe increment. I do not have any 7s in my hand, but this bid pressures the next player to either raise or challenge. Bidding 5 0s or higher quantity would be riskier given my hand.

However, bidding higher on 6s is risky because I only have one 6. Instead, I should consider bidding on a different digit where I have more information. I have a 7 in my hand, and the previous bid was 4 7s. Bidding 5 7s is a reasonable increase, leveraging the fact that I have a 7 in my hand and it's a higher digit than the current bid of 5 6s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. To outbid 5 7s, I must bid at least 5 8s or 6 of any digit. Since I have no 8s, bidding 5 8s is risky. I do have one 9, so bidding 5 9s is possible but still risky. Bidding 6 0s or higher quantity is a safer move because it increases the quantity, making it a valid higher bid. I have one 1, one 4, one 5, one 6, two 8s, and one 9, but no 0s. However, bidding 6 6s or 6 7s is not possible since 7s is the last bid digit and 6s is lower. The next valid higher bid after 5 7s with the same quantity would be 5 8s, but I have no 8s. The next higher quantity is 6, so the lowest digit at quantity 6 is 0. I have no 0s, but bidding 6 0s is reasonable. Given the total of 24 digits, 6 0s is plausible. Therefore, I will bid 6 0s.
