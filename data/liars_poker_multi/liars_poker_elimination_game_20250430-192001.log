Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no previous bid has been made, I can start by bidding a reasonable quantity of a digit I hold multiple copies of. I have four 9s and two 7s, so bidding 4 9s seems like a strong opening, as it accurately reflects my hand and is not overly aggressive. This sets a solid baseline for subsequent bids.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand. The expected number of 9s among the other 40 unknown digits is about 4, so a total of 5 9s is unlikely (≈37% chance). It’s more probable the bid is false, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is None. I'll start by bidding a reasonable number of digits, given the total remaining digits. I have two 3s in my hand. Considering the previous bids, I'll aim for a digit that is not yet bid, and since 9s were bid previously, I'll choose a lower digit. I'll bid 4 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand, and the expected number of 2s in the remaining 32 digits (from other players) is 3.2, leading to a total expected count of 6.2. This makes the current bid of 4 2s very likely to be true. Bidding 5 2s leverages my strong holding in 2s and the high probability of the total count exceeding 5.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits: 61729425. I see that I have one 2 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40, and there are 40 total digits remaining, bidding a high quantity is risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding a higher digit with a reasonable quantity might be more feasible. I have two 6s in my hand, which is a higher digit than 2. Bidding 2 6s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and seems achievable given my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s made by Player 3. I have 2 2s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have a high quantity of 2s, I will increase the digit. Bidding 5 3s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit and I have one 3 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid is 5 3s, which means there would need to be at least three more 3s among the other four players (total of 32 digits). Given that 3s are not extremely common and the bid is already at 5, challenging seems reasonable as it's unlikely there are that many 3s in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is None, and I have two 3s, two 4s, one 5, one 6, and two 7s in my hand. Since I have two 3s, a reasonable starting bid would be to bid on 3s with a quantity that reflects my hand and leaves room for other players' hands. Bidding 3 3s is a safe starting bid as it's based on my hand and allows for other players to have at least one more 3.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s, and I have the following digits: 9, 4, 9, 9, 7, 7, 0, 7. Counting the 3s in my hand, I have none. Given the total remaining digits are 32, and previous bids have been relatively high, it's unlikely that there are at least 3 threes across all hands. Challenging now could be effective, as the bid seems unlikely to be true. Alternatively, I could bid higher, but with no 3s in my hand, increasing the count or digit isn't feasible. Therefore, challenging seems the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is None, and I have two 3s in my hand. Starting with a conservative bid of 3 3s seems reasonable, as it's based on my hand and leaves room for other players to bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s, and I have a 3 in my hand. Since the maximum possible quantity is 24, bidding 4 3s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have zero 3s in my hand, and with 16 remaining digits across the other two players, the expected number of 3s is approximately 1.6 (assuming uniform distribution). A bid of 4 3s requires at least 4 3s in total, which is statistically unlikely given the low expected value. Additionally, in the previous round, Player 5's bid of 3 3s was validated with exactly 3 3s, suggesting the count may still be low. Challenging is the optimal move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. Bidding 3 2s ensures that even if Player 5 has zero 2s, the total count is exactly 3, making the bid valid. If Player 5 challenges immediately, I win the challenge and Player 5 is eliminated. This forces Player 5 to bid higher or risk losing, giving me a strategic advantage.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one '2' in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s, which means Player 3 is suggesting there are at least three '2's in total between our hands. Since I only have one, it's unlikely Player 3 has two '2's in their hand. Challenging seems like the best move.
