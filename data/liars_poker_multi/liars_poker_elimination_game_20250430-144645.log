Player 0 Reasoning: I have 2 9s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can make a bid with any quantity and digit. I'll start by bidding a reasonable quantity and digit, 2 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 1. I have the digits 2, 8, 6, 9, 8, 4, 4, and 9 in my hand, which means I have one 6. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 6, increasing the quantity to 4 or more 6s seems unlikely. However, I can bid on a digit that I have multiple instances of. I have two 8s and two 4s, and I can bid on these digits. Bidding 2 8s seems reasonable as it's higher than 3 6s in terms of digit value and I have the digits to back it up.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 1. I have the digits 2, 8, 6, 9, 8, 4, 4, 9 in my hand, which includes one 6. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 6, bidding a higher quantity for 6s seems risky. However, I can bid a higher digit with a reasonable quantity. I will bid 2 8s, as there are two 8s in my hand and it's a higher digit than 6.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 3/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains an 8, which is higher than 6, I can bid on 8s. Given that there are 6 players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 48 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. Bidding 1 8 seems reasonable as it's a higher digit than 6, but I should consider if challenging could be more beneficial or if a higher quantity bid is feasible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. With 48 total digits, the expected count for any digit is around 4.8, making 4 0s a reasonable bid. Challenging it is risky. My hand contains two 5s. Bidding 4 5s is a valid, higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) that is well-supported by my hand and the probability across other players.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains a 6, and the current bid is 4 5s. Bidding 4 6s increases the digit while keeping the same quantity, which is a valid and strategic move based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s, and I need to bid higher. I have one 6 in my hand, which supports the plausibility of this digit count. The next higher bid could be either 4 7s or 5 0s. Since 4 7s is a minimal increment and I have no 7s, bidding 4 7s is a cautious move. Bidding 5 0s is riskier but might pressure others. Given the moderate current bid and my hand, bidding 4 7s is a reasonable conservative increase.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. I should increase the digit to a higher number, but I don't have enough information about other players' hands to make a confident bid. However, I have two 9s, so I can make a reasonable bid with a higher quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s. The previous round shows that there is at least one 7 in the remaining players' hands. I should try to bid on a digit that is likely to be present in multiple hands. Since I have two 6s, bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and quantity slightly.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 1. I have a 6 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have much information about other players' hands, I will increase the quantity slightly and bid 4 6s, as it's a reasonable increase based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand. With 4 other players holding a total of 32 digits, the expected number of 6s among them is 3.2. A bid of 4 is slightly above this expectation. Based on probability (Binomial distribution n=32, p=0.1), the chance of having less than 4 sixes is approximately 61.8%. This makes challenging the bid a favorable move with a good probability of success.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current round has just started with no bids yet. My hand is 28698449, which contains two 6s and one 8. Since I start bidding and need to make a bid that is valid, I should consider the digits in my hand and make a reasonable initial bid. Bidding 2 6s seems like a good starting point as it is based on my hand and not too high given the total digits remaining.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand, and with 32 total digits remaining across 4 players, it's plausible the actual count of 6s is less than 2. Challenging this bid risks losing if there are indeed two 6s, but given the low quantity and my own 6, it's a reasonable gamble to test the bid's validity.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current round has just started with a total of 24 digits remaining across 3 players. My hand is 28698449, which contains two 6s. Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I notice my hand has two 6s, so bidding 2 6s seems reasonable as a starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Given that there have been multiple bids involving the digit 6, it's possible that other players have 6s as well. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, as it increases the quantity while maintaining the same digit. This bid is also likely to be believable given the previous bids and challenges.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 1. I have the hand 28698449, which contains two 6s. Given that there are only 3 active players left and each has 8 digits, the total number of digits across all players is 24. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. Since I have two 6s and there are two other players, it's possible that the total count of 6s could be higher than 4. However, bidding 5 6s would be a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity. But first, I need to assess if challenging could be more beneficial. Given my hand and the total digits remaining, challenging seems risky because 4 6s could potentially be accurate or close, considering other players might also have 6s. Therefore, making a higher bid seems more prudent.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Given that there are 24 digits remaining across 3 players, it's possible that there are more 6s. However, bidding higher on 6s seems risky. I could bid 6 7s, as I have one 7 in my hand, but this still feels risky. Challenging seems like the best option, as the current bid of 6 6s is quite high given the remaining digits and the history of challenges.

Given that there are only 16 digits in total for both players and we are down to two players, I should consider the likelihood of there being at least 3 6s. Since I have two 6s, if Player 1 has at least one 6, the bid could be valid. However, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than 3 6s. I can either increase the quantity or the digit.
