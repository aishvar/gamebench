Player 0 Reasoning: As the starting player, I need to make the opening bid. My hand contains three 8s, two 0s, one 1, one 6, and one 4. Since I have three 8s, bidding 3 8s is a strong opening, as it's likely that at least three 8s exist among all players. This also sets a relatively high digit, making it harder for others to immediately overbid with the same quantity.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I must bid higher than 4 9s. My hand has one 9, and considering there are 48 digits in total, bidding 5 2s is reasonable since 2 is a low digit and increasing the quantity to 5 is a valid higher bid. This is safer than bidding higher digits with the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 6 2s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average occurrence of any digit is 4.8 (48/10). A bid of 6 2s is slightly above average. However, the previous bids have been increasing steadily. I have two 5s, two 4s, one 2, one 9, one 1, and one 6. I could bid on 4s or 5s based on my hand. Bidding 7 4s or 7 5s would be a reasonable increase from 6 2s and is plausible given my hand and the number of players. Bidding 7 4s seems slightly safer as I have two 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 4s. In my hand (80710684), I have two 4s. With 48 total digits in play and 6 players, the expected average per digit is about 4.8. For there to be at least 7 4s, the other 5 players would need to collectively have at least 5 4s, which is possible but already above average. However, it's not so improbable as to immediately challenge. Instead, I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have two 8s in my hand, and 8s have not been bid up yet this round. Bidding 7 8s is a reasonable escalation, leveraging my hand's strength.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, so fulfilling a bid of 7 8s requires five or more 8s among the 40 unknown digits. The probability of that is under 40%, making the current bid more likely false than true. I should challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: It's the start of a new round with 5 players and 40 digits total. I have two 8s and two 0s in my hand. As the opening bidder, I want to set a reasonable starting bid that leverages my hand strength but doesn't overcommit. Bidding 3 8s is a solid opener since I personally hold two 8s, making it likely that there is at least one more among the other 32 digits.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (42775293), which is not strong support for increasing the count of 9s significantly. However, the bid must be strictly higher than 3 9s. The next valid bids could be 4 0s or higher quantity with any digit, or 3 0s to 3 9s with a higher digit, but since 9 is the highest digit, the quantity must increase. Bidding 4 0s is a safe increment and plausible because 0s can be common. I will bid 4 0s to raise the quantity and keep the game moving.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected number of 9s is around 4 (40 / 10). A bid of 5 9s is slightly above the expected value but not entirely unreasonable. Given the history of aggressive bidding and challenges, and having one 9 myself, challenging 5 9s is risky. Bidding higher is necessary. I have two 4s. Bidding 6 4s is a plausible increase in quantity and a lower digit, and I have some support for the 4s in my hand. Bidding 6 9s would be too high given I only have one 9. Bidding 6 of a digit I don't have is also risky. Bidding 6 4s seems like the most balanced move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (80710684), I have two 4s. The current bid is 6 4s. With 40 digits in play, the average expected count of any digit is 4. I have two, so the remaining 32 digits (across 4 players) would need to contain at least 4 more 4s to make the bid valid. This is possible but somewhat unlikely, as it would require an above-average distribution. However, since the bid is not extremely high and the risk of an early challenge may be premature, it is safer to make a minimal higher bid to keep pressure on the other players.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s by Player 2. I have one 0 in my hand (digit '0' appears once in 42775293). Since the bid is low, I can safely increase the bid by raising the digit while keeping the quantity the same. The next higher digit after 0 is 1, so bidding 1 1s is valid and reasonable given the low current bid.

Having one 6 in my hand makes it plausible that there are at least two 6s in total. However, bidding 3 6s might be slightly aggressive given the current low bids. Bidding 3 of a digit I have more of, like 3 4s (I have two 4s), is a safer and higher bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity same and increase the digit. Since the current quantity is 3, I can bid 3 6s or 4 0s or any higher digit with quantity 3 or more. I have two 7s and one 9 in my hand, so bidding 3 7s is plausible and a valid increase. Bidding 3 7s is a reasonable move to continue the game.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 25594416. The current bid is 4 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. With 4 players and 32 total digits, the average count for any digit is 3.2. A bid of 4 8s, while possible, is slightly above average and I have no support for it. Given the previous bids in this round have been relatively low and conservative, I suspect Player 4 might be bluffing or has exactly one 8. Challenging seems like a reasonable move here.

To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 3 but increase the digit. I have two 7s and one 9, so bidding 3 7s or 3 9s is possible. However, bidding 4 of any digit would be a stronger move. I have two 7s, so bidding 4 7s is a reasonable increase and still plausible given the total digits.

A bid of 4 7s is slightly above average, but not excessively so. I have zero 7s in my hand. I have two 5s and two 4s. I can bid 4 9s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a safe increase based on my hand and the distribution of digits. Alternatively, I could bid 5 of a lower digit, like 5 4s or 5 5s, but that's a larger jump in quantity. Bidding 4 9s is a conservative but valid move.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s, meaning at least five zeros are claimed among all 24 digits. I have one zero in my hand (42775293), so I know at least one zero exists. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. The next valid bid after 5 0s would be 5 1s or 6 0s. I have one '7' and one '9', but no '1's in my hand, so bidding 5 1s is riskier. Bidding 6 0s would be a quantity increase, but I only have one zero, so claiming 6 zeros total might be risky. Considering the previous bids and my hand, bidding 5 1s is the safest increase, as it is a higher digit with the same quantity. I do not believe the bid of 5 0s is unreasonable to challenge yet, so I will raise with 5 1s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I need to bid higher either by quantity or by digit with the same quantity. I have one '6' in my hand, but the bid is quite high. Increasing the quantity to 7 is a significant jump and risky. Increasing the digit to 7s at the same quantity (6 7s) is a valid raise and more plausible since I have one '7' in my hand. Challenging now might be risky as the bid is not excessively high considering there are 24 digits total. Therefore, I will bid 6 7s to stay in the game and pressure the next player.
