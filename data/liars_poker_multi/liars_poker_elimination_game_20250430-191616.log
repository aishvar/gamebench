Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since it's my turn to start and I have the hand 84010301, I can count my own digits. I see two 0s, one 1, two 3s, and one 8. The total number of digits across all players is 48. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but not too low. Given that there are 6 players and each has 8 digits, a bid on a digit that is somewhat common is reasonable. I will bid on a digit that I see in my hand. Bidding 6 1s seems like a reasonable starting point because it's a relatively low digit and I have one, so it's plausible others do too.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid of 6 1s seems unlikely given the expected average of 4.8 total 1s in all 48 digits. I have zero 1s in my hand, which suggests the actual count may be below 6. Challenging this bid carries a calculated risk but is statistically favorable.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. I have the hand '84010301', which contains two 1s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in total. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and the total number of digits. Bidding 6 1s seems like a good starting point as it is a relatively conservative bid considering the total count of digits and my own hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains four 4s and three 2s. The current bid is 6 1s. I need to bid higher. With 40 total digits and only 5 players, the average count of any digit is 4. A bid of 6 1s is slightly above average. My hand is strong in 4s and 2s. Bidding 6 2s is a valid higher bid and reflects the three 2s in my hand. Bidding 7 2s or 7 4s would be more aggressive but potentially justified given my hand and the remaining digits.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one ‘2’ in my hand. The 32 unknown digits among the other players are expected to contain about 3.2 more ‘2’s, for an expected total of only about 4.2 ‘2’s. The probability of seeing at least six ‘2’s is under 25%, making the bid of 6 2s unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have the hand 29460687, which contains one 2. Player 2 has bid 6 2s total among all players. With 4 active players and 8 digits each (32 total digits), this means Player 2 is claiming that at least 6 out of 32 digits (18.75%) are 2s. I have 1 out of 8 digits as a 2 (12.5% of my hand). If other players have a similar distribution, there would be about 4 total 2s. However, Player 2 has shown good judgment before - they correctly bid 6 2s in the previous round when there were 5 players. This suggests they might have several 2s in their hand. Given that I only have one 2, I think 6 2s is possible but somewhat high. I'll make a safe bid by increasing the digit to 3s. I have one 3 in my hand, so I'll bid 6 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. There are 32 total digits among the 4 active players. The expected number of any digit is 3.2 (32/10). A bid of 6 is significantly higher than the average. My hand (10192755) contains zero 3s. This means the other 24 digits held by the other three players must contain at least six 3s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 3s in those 24 digits is only 2.4 (24/10). Requiring 6 3s from the other players seems unlikely. While I could make a relatively safe bid of 6 5s (since I have two 5s), challenging the current bid appears statistically advantageous given I hold none of the bid digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I am Player 5 and it's my turn to make the opening bid in a 3-player round (24 total digits). My hand is 10192755, containing two 1s and two 5s as my highest counts. The expected number of any digit is 24/10 = 2.4. An opening bid should be relatively safe. Bidding on a digit I hold multiple of is standard. I have two 1s and two 5s. Player 0 has previously shown a preference for bidding 1s. Bidding 3 1s is a safe opening bid, as I hold two, and only one more is needed across the other 16 digits held by Player 0 and Player 2. This is statistically likely and leverages my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. With 24 total digits and 3 players, it's plausible that there are at least 3 ones. I can see one 1 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand is 84010301, which has digits 0, 1, 3, and 8. I can count that I have one 1 and one 3, and no digits higher than 3 except 8. Bidding 3 3s seems reasonable as it increases the digit. However, I should also consider the likelihood of other players having higher digits. Given that I have one 8 and there's a total of 24 digits, it's possible others might have 8s or other high digits, but I don't have information about their hands. Bidding 3 8s might be too aggressive without knowing others' hands. Thus, bidding 3 3s is a safer increase in bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 42422474. I have three 2s and three 4s. The current bid is 3 3s. I can easily bid 3 4s based on my hand, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Bidding 3 4s is a safe move given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s made by Player 2. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand is 10192755. I have zero 4s. For the bid of 3 4s to be true, the other two players (Player 0 and Player 2) must hold at least three 4s between their 16 digits. This is plausible, making a challenge somewhat risky. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Since I hold two 5s, this bid only requires one additional 5 among the remaining 16 digits held by the other two players, which is statistically likely. This bid leverages my hand's strength in 5s and is safer than challenging or bidding on a digit I hold fewer of.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 84010301, which contains one 0, two 1s, one 3, and one 8. The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 5. I need to bid higher than 3 5s. I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have two 1s and the previous bid was 3 1s, I believe there could be more than three 1s in total. However, increasing the quantity to 4 with the same digit (1) seems reasonable. Alternatively, bidding 3 6s is also an option as it is a higher digit. Given my hand doesn't have any 5s or 6s, and considering the distribution, bidding 3 6s might be a bit aggressive but is still within the realm of possibility. I will choose to bid 4 1s as it is a safer and more informed decision based on my hand.

I have four 2s, making a bid of 5 2s a strong possibility based on my hand. I also have three 4s, making 4 4s a possibility, but 5 2s is a higher quantity and based on a stronger holding in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s made by Player 2. There are 24 total digits among 3 players. I have one '2' in my hand (10192755). For the bid to be true, the other two players (Player 0 and Player 2) must have at least four '2's combined in their 16 digits. This seems somewhat high, as the expected number of 2s in 16 digits is 1.6. Challenging is an option. However, Player 2 has previously bid 2s successfully. Alternatively, I can make a higher bid. My hand contains two '5's. A bid of '5 5s' is higher than '5 2s'. This bid requires a total of five '5's across all hands. Since I have two '5's, we need three more '5's from the remaining 16 digits held by Player 0 and Player 2. This is more plausible (expected number is 1.6) than the current bid of 5 2s (where I only hold one '2' and need four more) or jumping to quantity 6. Bidding 5 5s leverages my hand's strength and puts pressure on the next player.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. My hand is 84010301, which contains one 5 and one 0, and other digits. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since there are 24 total digits and the current bid is 5 5s, I can analyze the likelihood. I have one 5, so there are 4 more 5s distributed among the other two players, which is plausible. However, bidding 6 5s or 5 6s seems reasonable. I will choose to bid 5 6s as it is a higher digit and I have some information about my own hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s made by Player 2. I have one '2' in my hand (10192755). For the bid to be true, the other 16 digits held by Player 0 and Player 2 must contain at least five '2's. Player 2 has bid strongly on 2s this round (5 2s, then 6 2s), suggesting they likely hold several (perhaps 3 or 4). If Player 2 holds 3 or 4 '2's, Player 0 only needs 1 or 2 '2's for the bid to be accurate, which is plausible. Therefore, challenging seems risky.

I need to make a higher bid. Options include 6 3s, 6 4s, 6 5s, ..., or increasing the quantity to 7.
My hand contains two '1's and two '5's.
- Bidding 6 5s: Leverages my two '5's. I previously bid 5 5s. This requires 4 more '5's from the other 16 digits.
- Bidding 7 1s: Leverages my two '1's. Requires 5 more '1's from the other 16 digits. Importantly, Player 0 previously bid 4 1s, suggesting they may hold several '1's, making a total of seven '1's more credible than six '5's (which only I have bid on recently).

Bidding 7 1s uses my hand, incorporates information from the bidding history (Player 0's interest in 1s), raises the quantity significantly, and avoids the risk of challenging Player 2's strong 2s bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s. I have the hand 84010301, which contains two 1s. Given that there are 24 digits in total and 3 players, the maximum number of 1s any player can have is 8. The current bid of 7 1s is plausible because it's below the maximum possible count of 24. However, I need to consider the likelihood of the count being at least 7. Since I have 2 ones, and assuming the other players have a reasonable distribution, I should assess if bidding higher or challenging is more appropriate. The next higher bid could be 7 2s or 8 0s/1s. I have zero 0s in my hand. I should analyze the likelihood of the count of 1s being at least 7. Given the previous bids and the fact that Player 5 started with a bid of 3 1s and eventually bid 7 1s, it suggests they might have a significant number of 1s. However, challenging seems risky without strong evidence. I will bid higher by increasing the digit. I will bid 7 2s because it's a safer increase in the bid by changing the digit rather than the quantity, and I have some information from my hand that can guide this decision.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand has four 2s. The current bid is 7 2s. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the expected number of 2s is around 2.4 (24 * 1/10). Since I have four 2s, it's plausible that there are more 2s than average across the table. However, a bid of 7 2s is quite high, requiring at least three more 2s between the other two players. Given the high bid and the history of challenges, challenging seems like a reasonable move, especially since going higher on 2s would require a very high quantity. Bidding on another digit would also require a significant jump in quantity or digit to exceed 7 2s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s by Player 2. There are 16 total digits (8 for me, 8 for Player 2). My hand is 10192755. I have one 2. For Player 2's bid to be accurate, Player 2 must have at least three 2s (4 total - 1 in my hand = 3 needed from Player 2). While 4 is above the expected average of 1.6 for any digit, Player 2 might have 2 or 3 2s, especially given their history of bidding 2s. Challenging seems risky. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 4 3s, 4 4s, ..., or 5 0s, 5 1s, etc. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 4 5s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires Player 2 to have at least two 5s for it to be true (4 total - 2 in my hand = 2 needed from Player 2). This seems like a plausible and safe bid based on my hand, putting the pressure back on Player 2.

A bid of 4 5s is significantly above average, especially since I have no 5s. However, Player 5 made the bid, and they might have multiple 5s.  A bid of 4 6s is a valid higher bid, increasing the digit. A bid of 5 2s is also valid, increasing the quantity based on my hand. Given my three 2s, bidding 5 2s seems like a safer and more strategic move than bidding 4 6s (where I have no 6s) or challenging a bid that Player 5 might be able to back up.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s by Player 2. There are 16 total digits (8 mine, 8 Player 2's). I have one 2 in my hand (10192755). For the bid to be true, Player 2 needs at least four 2s. This is plausible, but 5 out of 16 is a significant portion (31.25%). Challenging is risky because if Player 2 has exactly four 2s, I lose. Player 2 has been bidding 2s consistently, suggesting some strength, but could also be bluffing. My hand contains two 5s. Bidding 5 5s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires Player 2 to have at least three 5s. Given my hand, this seems like a reasonably safe bid that leverages my own digits and puts the pressure back on Player 2 without risking immediate elimination via a challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have four 2s and three 4s in my hand. The current bid is 5 5s. I can make a slightly higher bid based on my hand. Bidding 6 2s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have four 2s which supports this bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s, made by Player 2. There are 16 total digits (8 for me, 8 for Player 2). My hand is 10192755, which contains only one 2. For the bid of 6 2s to be true, Player 2 must have at least five 2s in their 8-digit hand (6 total - 1 in my hand = 5 needed from Player 2). The probability of a player having 5 or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is very low (expected value is 0.8). Although Player 2 has consistently bid on 2s this round, escalating from 4 2s to 6 2s, requiring 5 out of their 8 digits seems like a significant overbid or bluff in a 16-digit game. My own hand doesn't strongly support a higher safe bid (e.g., 6 5s would require Player 2 to have four 5s, which is also unlikely, and 7 1s would require Player 2 to have five 1s). Given the improbability of Player 2 holding five 2s, challenging is the most strategically sound move.
