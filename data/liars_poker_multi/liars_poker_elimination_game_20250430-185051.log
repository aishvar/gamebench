Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 3 1s and 1 7 in my hand. Since there are no bids yet, I should start with a reasonable bid. Bidding 2 1s is a safe starting point, as I have at least two 1s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48, and there are 6 players with 8 digits each, I should consider what digits I have and what would be a reasonable bid. My hand contains 1 1, so bidding a higher quantity or digit seems feasible. I have multiple higher digits (7, 6, 8) that could make a strong bid. Bidding 3 1s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one '1' in my hand (09312784). With 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected average count for any digit is 4.8. A bid of 3 1s is below this average and therefore quite likely to be true. Challenging seems risky. I need to make a higher bid. I can either bid 4 of any digit or keep the quantity at 3 and bid a higher digit. My hand contains one '2'. Bidding '3 2s' is a minimal increase over '3 1s', is statistically plausible (since I hold one '2' and the bid is below average), and forces the next player to make a higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 2s' by Player 2, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have the digits 3, 6, 9, 7, 4, 2, 0, and 8 in my hand, I notice that I have one 2, but no additional information about the other players' hands that would suggest a safe increase in quantity for the digit 2 or a shift to a higher digit with the same quantity. However, considering the total number of digits remaining (48) and the fact that we are still early in the game with all players active, bidding on a higher digit or increasing the quantity significantly might be risky without more information. Given my hand, I could consider bidding on a digit I have, like 3, 6, 9, 7, 4, or 8, but since the current bid is on 2s, I must decide whether to increase the quantity or move to a higher digit. Since moving to a higher digit with the same quantity (3) seems more manageable and I have a 3 in my hand, I will consider bidding on a digit higher than 2 that I also have in my hand, aiming for a balance between risk and potential gain.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s by Player 3, which is almost certain given I hold one 3 and expect about four more among the 40 unknown cards. Instead of challenging, I should raise the bid. I hold two 2s and statistically there should be around four more 2s, so bidding 4 2s is both valid (quantity >3) and backed by my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. Player 4 claims there are at least 4 twos. Given that I only have one 2, and no other players showed strong confidence in 2s earlier (only Player 2 bid 3 2s), it seems unlikely there are 3 more 2s among the other players. The bid of 4 2s seems risky to challenge but safer than making a higher bid without strong evidence. I'll challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand (67398220) and across 40 digits the expected count of any digit is about 4. Bidding 3 2s requires only one more among opponents, giving a high chance the bid holds and starts at a reasonable quantity to pressure others upward.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s made by Player 0. I have one 3 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have many high digits, bidding 4 3s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. However, I should also consider the likelihood of higher digits being present. My hand is 76866117, which doesn't have many high digits but does have a 7 and a 6. Bidding 4 3s seems like a safe increase based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand (09312784). This means the bid requires at least three more 3s among the remaining 32 digits held by the other 4 players. The expected average count for any digit across 40 total digits is 4 (40/10). Player 0 previously bid 3 3s and Player 1 raised to 4 3s, suggesting they might hold 3s, making the bid plausible. Challenging seems risky as the bid aligns with the statistical average. A higher bid is necessary. The minimal safe bid is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same: 4 4s. I hold one 4, so this bid requires three more 4s from the other 32 digits, which is statistically as likely as the current bid. Raising the quantity to 5 seems overly aggressive given my hand distribution. Therefore, bidding 4 4s is the most logical step.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 4s' and my hand '36974208', I notice I have one '4'. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 40 and there are 5 players, each with 8 digits, the maximum number of any single digit is capped at 40. Since I only have one '4', to make a bid, I must consider either increasing the quantity, which seems risky given the cap, or increasing the digit, which might be more feasible. However, increasing the digit to '5' or higher while keeping the quantity at '4' or more could be challenging without more information about other players' hands. Given the bidding history, players have been cautious, and bids have been gradually increasing. Without strong evidence to challenge the current bid confidently, and considering my hand does not provide a clear advantage for a higher bid on '4s' or higher digits, I must weigh the risks. Since the current bid is '4 4s', and I have limited information to safely challenge or significantly raise the bid, I should consider a strategic move that does not overextend. Given these considerations, making a bid on a higher digit seems like a reasonable approach, considering the gradual increase in bids and the need to stay competitive.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have zero 5s in my hand. Among the 32 unknown digits the expected number of 5s is only 3.2, so the chance of having at least four 5s is under 40%, meaning it’s more likely the bid is false. I should challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: I hold two 2s in my hand. With 32 total digits the expected count of 2s is about 3.2, so bidding 4 2s (requiring at least two more among the 24 unseen digits) has around a 70% chance of being correct. This is a strong opening bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. Given that the total digits remaining is 32, I have 8 digits in my hand, and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32, bidding 5 2s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s made by Player 0. I have 8 secret digits in my hand: 76866117. I count two 2s in my hand. Given that there are 4 active players and 8 digits per player, there are a total of 32 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. The bid of 5 2s seems plausible but not extremely high. I have one 6 and two 2s, and other digits do not seem to align well for a strong bid yet. I should consider bidding slightly higher if possible or challenging if the bid seems unlikely. Since my hand contains two 2s and I do not have information on others' hands, bidding seems safer than challenging at this point. I will bid higher than 5 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s with 32 total digits across 4 players. The statistical average for any digit is 3.2 (32/10). The bid is significantly higher than the average. I only hold one '2' in my hand (09312784). This means the other three players need to hold at least five '2's among their 24 digits for the bid to be accurate. While the bidding escalated (4 2s -> 5 2s -> 6 2s), suggesting others might hold 2s, a bid of 6 is still quite aggressive. Bidding higher myself (e.g., 6 3s or 7 of any digit) is difficult given my diverse hand with only one of each digit except 5 and 6. Challenging seems like a more prudent move given the high bid relative to the statistical expectation and my own hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: It's my turn to start the bidding in this round (3 players, 24 total digits). My hand is 09312784, containing one 1. The statistical average for any digit is 2.4 (24 digits / 10 possibilities). An opening bid should be relatively safe. Bidding '2 1s' is a conservative start. I hold one 1, and it's statistically likely there is at least one more 1 among the other 16 hidden digits held by Player 0 and Player 4. This bid is below the statistical average and forces the next player to raise the quantity or the digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s, made by Player 0. I have one '2' in my hand (09312784). Player 4 previously bid 2 2s. For the current bid of 3 2s to be false, the other two players (Player 0 and Player 4) must have fewer than two '2's combined across their 16 digits. Given Player 4 bid 2 2s and Player 0 raised to 3 2s, it's reasonably likely that there are indeed at least three '2's in total. Challenging seems risky. The next possible bid is 3 3s. I hold one '3'. Bidding 3 3s is the minimum possible raise, shifts the digit away from the contested '2's, and is statistically plausible (requiring at least two more '3's among the other 16 digits, which is below the average of 2.4 per digit). This is a conservative but safe progression.

Player 2 Reasoning: I am Player 2 and start the bidding in this head-to-head round (16 total digits). My hand is 09312784, which contains one '1', one '2', one '3', etc. The expected average count for any digit is 1.6 (16 digits / 10 possible digits). A bid of '2 1s' is a relatively safe opening bid. I hold one '1', meaning the bid is true if the opponent (Player 0) has at least one '1' in their 8-digit hand. This is statistically probable and forces Player 0 to either increase the bid or make a potentially risky challenge early on.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one '1' in my hand (09312784). The current bid is '3 1s', made by Player 0. This bid came after my initial bid of '2 1s'. For Player 0's bid to be true, they need at least two '1's in their hand (since I only have one). Given they raised my bid on '1's, it's reasonably likely they hold at least one '1', making the total potentially three or more. Challenging feels risky. The lowest possible higher bid is '3 2s'. I have one '2' in my hand. This bid requires Player 0 to have at least two '2's, which is plausible out of their 8 digits. Making a minimal bid increase seems safer than challenging.
