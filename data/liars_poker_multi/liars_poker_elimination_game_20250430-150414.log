Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the quantity is 1, I can increase it to 2, or I can keep the quantity at 1 and bid a higher digit. Given that I have one 0, bidding 2 0s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 1 of a higher digit if I have it, but I don't see any higher digits in my hand that would make sense to bid on yet.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 zeros. I have no zeros in my hand, but the bid is very low and easily beatable. I can raise the bid by increasing the quantity or digit. I have three 6s in my hand, so bidding 2 sixes is a reasonable and valid increment over 2 zeros.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s. Since the total number of digits across all players is 48, the expected count of any digit is approximately 4.8. Bidding 3 2s is a reasonable increase in quantity, as it's likely the total 2s exceed 3.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (22704612), I have two 2s. Player 3 has bid '3 2s', claiming there are at least 3 twos among all players. Since I already have 2 of them in my hand, this bid seems quite reasonable - we only need 1 more two among the other 5 players to make this bid valid. I could challenge, but it's very likely to be a valid bid. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I could bid '3 4s' (I have one 4 in my hand), '3 6s' (I have one 6), or '3 7s' (I have one 7). I could also increase the quantity to 4, but that's riskier. Since I have two 2s and one 1, bidding on those digits would be risky. I'll bid '3 6s' since I have one 6 and it's a higher digit than 2.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, so increasing the quantity to 4 6s is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 6s and aims to pressure other players with a stronger claim.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s made by Player 5. I have 2 sixes in my hand (18011813). To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s, bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 2 8s, which would increase the digit. However, without information on other players' hands, I must make an educated guess. Given that I have a moderate number of digits and the total digits remaining is 40, I will increase the quantity.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (digits: 51633667), which supports the plausibility of the bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit. Since 3 7s is higher than 3 6s and I have one 7, bidding 3 7s is reasonable and not too aggressive, making it a safe move.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. The probability that the remaining 32 digits (from other players) contain at least one 2 is approximately 96.6% (1 - (0.9)^32). This makes a bid of 4 2s highly likely to be valid, as the total count would be at least 4 (3 from me + 1 from others). This bid strictly increases the quantity over the current 3 7s, making it a strong strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Looking at my hand, I have two 2s. Player 3 has bid 4 2s, claiming there are at least four 2s among all players. Since I have two 2s myself, there would only need to be two more 2s among the other four players for this bid to be valid, which is quite reasonable. I could challenge, but it's risky given my knowledge. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have one 4 and one 6 in my hand, but no 3s, 5s, 7s, 8s, or 9s. I could bid 4 3s, 4 4s, 4 5s, 4 6s, 4 7s, 4 8s, 4 9s, or increase the quantity to 5 of any digit. Since I have a 6 in my hand, bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, but Player 1 already bid 3 6s earlier, suggesting they might have some 6s. I'll go with 5 2s since I already know I have two 2s, increasing the quantity rather than the digit.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. With 40 total digits remaining and my hand containing no 2s, it's plausible the actual count of 2s is below 5. Challenging this bid risks eliminating Player 4 if they're bluffing, which aligns with the low probability of 5 2s given the average distribution.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding in this round with my hand 22704612. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, one 7, one 0, one 4, one 6, and one 1. Based on previous rounds, I know 6s and 2s have been relatively common. In my hand, I have two 2s, which gives me some confidence in bidding on this digit. Since I'm making the first bid, I can start conservatively. A reasonable opening bid would be '3 2s', expecting that the other three players combined have at least one more 2 in their hands, which is quite likely given the distribution of digits and previous rounds showing 2s were common.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s made by Player 4. I have the hand 18011813, which contains two 1s, one 8, one 0, one 3, and two other digits. I don't have any 2s in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 32 total digits remaining across all players, bidding a high quantity seems risky. However, I can see if there's a possibility to make a reasonable bid. Since my hand doesn't contribute to the count of 2s, I need to consider if challenging is more viable or if I can make a bid that is strictly higher and reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding in this round with 3 players (including myself). Looking at my hand (22704612), I have two 2s, one 7, one 0, one 4, one 6, and one 1. The most frequent digit in my hand is 2, which appears twice. Since there are 24 total digits in play (8 per player × 3 players), and I already have two 2s, it's reasonable to assume there might be more 2s among the other players. From previous rounds, I've seen that 2s have been relatively common (there were 6 of them in the previous round with 4 players). A conservative opening bid would be '3 2s', meaning I'm betting there are at least 3 twos among all players. I already have 2 in my hand, so I only need 1 more among the other 16 digits not in my possession, which is quite likely.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s, meaning at least three 2s among all 24 digits. I have no 2s in my hand (51633667). Given that Player 4 just bid 3 2s, and considering the history where bids of 4 or 5 2s were proven correct, it seems plausible. However, since I have no 2s, the probability that there are at least 3 2s in total is uncertain but possible. I can raise the bid by increasing the digit with the same quantity, so I can bid 3 3s. I have three 3s in my hand, which supports this bid. This is a valid higher bid and reasonable given my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s, but I have no 3s in my hand (75572221). With 24 total digits remaining, the average expected count for any digit is 2.4. Since the bid requires at least 3 3s, and I cannot account for any, it is statistically unlikely that the combined hands of Player 2 and Player 4 contain exactly 3 3s. This makes challenging a calculated risk to eliminate Player 2 if the bid is false.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. In my hand (22704612), I have two 2s. The current bid from Player 3 is '3 2s', meaning they're claiming there are at least 3 twos between our hands. Since I already have 2 twos, their claim requires them to have at least 1 two in their hand, which is quite reasonable. I could safely bid '3 3s' to increase the digit while keeping the same quantity, or I could bid '4 2s' to increase the quantity. Given that I know I have 2 twos, bidding '4 2s' would require Player 3 to have at least 2 twos, which is possible but less certain. Looking at my hand, I have one 6, so I could also bid '3 6s'. Based on previous rounds, Player 3 has shown willingness to bid on 2s, suggesting they might indeed have some. I'll play it safe and increase the digit rather than the quantity.

Player 3 Reasoning: Current bid is 3 3s. I have zero 3s in my hand, so all 3s must be in Player 4's hand. Statistically, the probability of Player 4 having at least 3 3s is low (expected ~0.8 3s in their 8-digit hand). Player 4 could be bluffing, especially since they raised from 3 2s despite my known 3 2s. Challenging is optimal.
