Player 0 Reasoning: As the game starts, I have a relatively balanced hand with no obvious high-value digits. Considering the total digits remaining (48), a conservative initial bid is reasonable. I'll bid 4 on a digit (9) that's not too high, giving me a chance to adjust my strategy in future rounds.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand and expect about 4 more among the 40 unknown digits (expected total ~6), so bidding 5 6s is reasonable. I must raise the current bid of 4 9s by increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s, which means at least six zeros across all players' hands. I have one zero in my hand. Previous bids were 4 9s, 5 6s, and 5 9s, so the bid has increased in quantity. Since the current bid is 6 zeros, I need to bid higher. Increasing the quantity to 7 zeros is a valid bid. Given the total digits and my hand, this seems plausible.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s made by Player 4. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than 7 0s. I have a hand of 27919576, which contains two 0s. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 active players, each with 8 digits, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. Given that the current bid is 7 0s, I should aim to bid higher either by increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 0s, I can try to bid on a digit that is more likely to have a higher count or bid a higher digit with a lower quantity. Bidding 8 0s seems risky since I only have two 0s and it's unlikely there are 8 in total. I will bid on a higher digit that I have in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s made by Player 4. I have 8 digits in my hand: 2, 7, 9, 1, 9, 5, 7, 6. I see that I have no 0s in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48 and there are 6 active players with 8 digits each (total of 48 digits), bidding a high quantity seems risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding a higher digit with a reasonable quantity might be a safer strategy. Since I have two 7s and two 9s, bidding on a digit I have seems sensible. I will bid higher than 7 0s by increasing the digit and providing a reasonable quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 3/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s made by Player 4. I have 8 digits in my hand: 2, 7, 9, 1, 9, 5, 7, 6. I see that I have two 7s and two 9s, but no 0s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48 and there are 6 active players with 8 digits each (total of 48 digits), bidding a high quantity seems risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding a higher digit with a reasonable quantity might be a safer strategy. Since I have two 7s, bidding on 7 seems reasonable. The current bid is 7 0s, so I need to bid higher than this. I can bid 8 7s as my quantity is based on my hand and it's higher than 7.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains three 5s. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid that reflects my hand's composition. Bidding 3 5s is a logical choice as it directly corresponds to the count of 5s I hold, and it's a valid starting bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since I only have one 5, bidding 4 5s might be risky. Instead, bidding 3 6s is a valid higher bid with the same quantity but a higher digit. I have one 6 in my hand, which supports this bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 4. I have the digits 2, 7, 9, 1, 9, 5, 7, 6 in my hand, which means I have one 6. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains one 6, bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit seems reasonable. I will bid 4 6s as it is a straightforward increase in quantity and utilizes the information from my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s, which is likely (about a 70% chance of being true), so challenging is too risky. To stay in, the best raise is 5 6s: I need at least three more 6s among the 24 unknown digits, which has about a 43% chance. This is more reasonable than bidding higher digits I donâ€™t hold or quantities requiring more unlikely counts.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have no 6s in my hand, but I can bid 5 7s, which is a valid higher bid as it maintains the same quantity but increases the digit. This keeps the game going and avoids an immediate challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I need to make a strictly higher bid. I have one '7' in my hand, which is not many, so bidding a much higher quantity of 7s might be risky. Bidding the same quantity (5) but a higher digit is allowed, so I can bid 5 8s. This is a modest increase and still plausible given the total 32 digits in play. Challenging now seems premature since the bid is not extreme.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s made by Player 4. I have 8 digits in my hand: 2, 7, 9, 1, 9, 5, 7, 6. I see that I have one 6 and two 7s, and two 9s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 32 total digits remaining, I need to assess if bidding higher is reasonable or if challenging is more strategic. The current bid is 5 8s. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 6 7s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and utilizes a digit I have in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. As the opening bid, bidding 3 6s leverages my known cards and is supported by the expected distribution: with 16 unknown digits, thereâ€™s about an 82% chance of seeing at least one additional 6, making this a safe and reasonable start.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. My hand contains no 6s, and with 24 total digits remaining across three players, it's plausible the actual count of 6s is less than 3.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand (digit '5' is not present in my hand 0,1,4,9,2,8,3,9), so I cannot count on my own cards to support a higher quantity of 5s.
