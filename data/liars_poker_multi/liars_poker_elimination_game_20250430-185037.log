Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 22101740, which contains two 0s, two 1s, two 2s, and one 7, and one 4. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative. I have a total of 8 digits, with the highest count being 2 for the digits 0, 1, and 2. Considering there are 6 players and 48 digits in total, a bid of 3 or 4 for a common digit like 0, 1, or 2 could be reasonable. I'll start with bidding 4 1s as it is a relatively safe and not too aggressive start.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I see one “1” in my hand, so there must be at least three more among the other 40 cards. With expected ~4 eights among those 40, and holding two myself, bidding 4 8s (same quantity, higher digit) is a minimal, very likely raise.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits and a ~97% chance there’s at least one more 8 among them, opening with 3 8s is a safe, reasonable bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which requires at least three 8s in total. Since there are 40 digits remaining across 5 players, it's plausible there are more 8s. Bidding 4 8s increases the quantity, maintaining a valid higher bid while leveraging the possibility of additional 8s in other players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 3. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each player has 8 digits, there are a total of 40 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Since I do not have enough information to guarantee a higher count of 8s, but I do have an 8, I should consider the likelihood of there being more than 4 8s. However, I can make a safe bid by increasing the digit. I have a 9 in my hand, and bidding on a higher digit with a reasonable quantity seems like a good strategy.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 9s and I have one 9 in my hand, I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40 and we are already at a bid of 4 9s, making a significantly higher bid might be risky. However, considering the total digits remaining and the fact that I have a 9, it seems plausible that there could be at least 4 nines among all players. Challenging seems less favorable without strong evidence against the bid. A safer approach could be to bid on a digit that I have more of or seems more likely to occur. I have two 1s and considering the game history where Player 0 initially bid 4 1s, it suggests 1s might be more common. However, bidding on 1s directly higher than 4 9s is not possible due to the digit value. Thus, I must either challenge or find a digit that is higher and plausible. Given the constraints and aiming for a strategic move, challenging the current bid of 4 9s seems like a less favorable option without more insight into other players' hands. Instead, I should look for a digit that allows me to make a valid higher bid. Since I cannot increase the quantity of 9s without risking a challenge and potentially losing, my next best option is to consider bidding on a higher digit if I had any, or increasing the quantity of a digit I have more of, but given the rules, increasing quantity of a lower digit than 9 doesn't constitute a 'higher' bid. Given the current state and my hand, I must carefully consider the likelihood of success for any given bid. Without a clear path to a higher bid that feels secure, and considering the risk of elimination, my thought process must prioritize caution while also considering the potential for other players to have digits that could fulfill or exceed the current bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my turn as Player 4. I have the digits 7, 8, 9, 6, 6, 3, 1, 4 in my hand. I see that I have two 6s. Starting with a bid seems reasonable. I will bid 2 6s as it's a conservative bid based on my hand and leaves room for others to bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (from 22101740). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have one 6, and there are 3 other players, it's plausible that there is at least one more 6 among them, making a total of at least 2 6s likely. I will increase the quantity to make a higher bid. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable next step as it is a minimal increase in quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand. With 24 unknown digits and p=0.1 for 6s, expected count is 2.4 and the probability of at least 3 6s is only ~43.5%, so the current bid of 3 6s is more likely false. I should challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Across 24 cards the expected number of 8s is about 2.4. With two guaranteed and a high probability (over 80%) of seeing at least one more 8 among the other 16 cards, bidding 3 8s is a safe opening.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. My hand contains one 8, and with two other players, the total 8s across all hands are likely to be low. Challenging this bid is reasonable as it's improbable that there are at least 3 8s given my limited count and the uncertainty of others' hands.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding “2 8s” is risk-free: if challenged, I will win since the actual count is at least 2. It’s the strongest quantity-2 bid based on my hand, forcing Player 4 to either bid “2 9s” or raise the quantity on their turn.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s made by Player 1. I have the hand 78966314, which contains one 8. Given that there are only 16 digits in total for both players and my hand already accounts for one 8, it is plausible that Player 1's bid could be valid or not. However, I must consider the risk and potential reward of challenging versus bidding. Since my goal is to either make a valid higher bid or challenge if I think the bid is unlikely, I should assess the likelihood of there being 2 or more 8s in total. With one 8 in my hand, if Player 1 has at least one 8, the bid could be valid. A higher bid would require at least 3 8s or a higher digit with a quantity of 2. I have a 9 in my hand, which could be a good option.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand and the current bid is 3 8s. To bid 4 8s I need two more 8s in my opponent’s 8 cards. With a 10% chance per card, the chance of at least two is about 42%, making this the strongest valid raise.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 1. I have the hand 78966314, which contains one 8. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, the maximum possible count for any digit is 16. The bid of 4 8s seems high but not impossible. However, I do not have enough information about Player 1's hand to be certain. I will bid higher by increasing the quantity since I have one 8 and it's a reasonable risk.
