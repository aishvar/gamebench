Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. I have two 5s in my hand. A conservative bid of 2 5s is a good starting point, as it's based on my own hand and doesn't immediately commit me to a high quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 2 5s and my hand of 07226802, I notice that I do not have any 5s. However, I should consider the possibility that other players might have 5s. Since the bid is relatively low and there are 48 digits in total, it's plausible that there could be at least 2 5s among all players. Considering my own hand does not contribute to the count of 5s, I must decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Given that my hand contains digits that could potentially be part of a higher bid, such as the 6s, I could consider bidding higher on a different digit. However, without more information about the distribution of other digits, challenging seems risky. A safer approach might be to increase the bid on a digit I have more information about or seems more likely based on my hand. Since I have two 6s and no 5s, bidding on 6s could be a strategic move, increasing both the quantity and the digit from the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current state of the game with no bids yet and considering my hand 07226802, I notice I have two 6s and two 0s, but no 5s or higher digits. Since the game just started and there are no previous bids to build upon or challenge, I need to make an initial bid. The safest approach is to bid on a digit I have in my hand to ensure at least some presence of that digit. Bidding on the 0s seems like a conservative start because I have two of them, and it gives other players less room to maneuver with higher bids immediately.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. In my hand (24754684), I have zero 0s. However, with 40 digits in play, it's quite likely that there are at least 2 zeros among all hands. Challenging would be risky. I will make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 1, bidding 2 1s, as this is the minimal legal raise and keeps my options open for future turns.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand, which means the current bid of 2 1s requires at least one more 1 in the remaining 32 digits. While possible, challenging carries risk. Instead, I can safely bid 2 3s since I hold two 3s, ensuring the bid's validity and leveraging my knowledge of my own hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. Bidding 3 4s would be a reasonable increase, but might be risky. I also have two 5s, so bidding 3 5s is a possibility. However, given the previous challenge and win on 2 6s, players seem willing to bid somewhat aggressively. I have one 8, one 9, one 0, three 5s, one 1, and one 3. Bidding 3 5s seems like a good option, as I have two in my hand and it's a higher digit than 4, while still being a plausible number. Alternatively, I could challenge, but 2 4s doesn't seem outrageously high. I'll bid 3 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 5s and my hand containing 07226802, I notice I have no 5s but I do have two 6s and other digits. Since the current bid is 3 5s, to make a higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Considering the total digits remaining and the distribution, bidding on a higher digit seems more reasonable. However, without any 5s in my hand and considering the risk of challenging, I should think about the likelihood of the current bid being true. Given that there are 40 digits in total and 5 players, the average distribution per player is 8 digits. The bid of 3 5s seems plausible but not extremely high given the total number of digits. However, since I have two 6s and considering the bids made so far, I might consider bidding on 6s to increase the digit value, keeping in mind that my bid must be strictly higher than 3 5s. Since I have two 6s, bidding 3 6s could be a strategic move, leveraging my hand's composition and the current state of the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 24754684, which contains one 6. The current bid is 3 6s. With 5 players and 40 digits in play, it's likely there are at least three 6s among all hands. However, I only have one, so I shouldn't push the quantity much higher unless I have strong evidence. The next legal bid is either 3 7s or 4 0s. I have one 7 and one 0, but since 0 is less likely to be distributed (due to psychological factors and randomness), I'll bid 3 7s, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit, which is a safe incremental move.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, which supports the current bid of 3 7s. However, the statistical expectation of 7s across all 40 digits is around 4, making the bid likely valid. Challenging would risk elimination. Instead, leveraging my two 9s, bidding 3 9s is a strategic higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) that aligns with my hand and avoids direct confrontation with the statistically probable truth of the current bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid of 3 9s is quite plausible (I see one 9 and expect ~3.2 more in 32 unknown digits), so I shouldn’t challenge. To outbid 3 9s I must move to quantity 4. I hold two 2s, so bidding 4 2s only requires two more 2s among the 32 unknown digits (P≈84%), making this a reasonable raise.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. The previous bids have been relatively conservative. Given the history of successful bids and the remaining total digits (40), a bid of 4 3s seems plausible, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Alternatively, I could challenge, but given the earlier successful bids, it's likely Player 5 has at least four 2s, or is bluffing effectively. I'll bid slightly higher to test the waters.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 2s and two 0s in my hand. The current bid is 4 3s. Considering the total digits remaining and the bidding history, increasing the quantity to 5 for a digit that I have in my hand seems reasonable. Since I have two 2s, bidding on 2s could be a good strategy, but I should also consider the possibility of other players having 2s. Given that the current bid is on 3s and I don't have any 3s, I can try to increase the quantity for 2s, which I have in my hand, to make a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand, and the current bid is 5 2s. With 40 digits in play and only one 2 in my hand, it's unlikely there are five 2s total unless other players have more than average. However, since 5 is not an extreme number for any digit, challenging now is risky. I also have two 4s, two 4s, and two 4s (digits 4, 4, and 4), but that's a mistake—my hand is 2,4,7,5,4,6,8,4, so I have three 4s. Since I have three 4s, bidding 5 4s is a reasonable and safe way to increase the bid, as I contribute a significant portion myself.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s made by Player 5. Considering there are 24 total digits remaining and I only have one 2, it's possible but not extremely likely that there are three 2s in total. However, without more information about the other players' hands, it's difficult to assess the likelihood accurately. Given that I need to make a strictly higher bid, I could try to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have enough information to confidently bid on a higher quantity of 2s or any other specific digit, and challenging seems risky without strong evidence against the bid, I will choose to make a bid that increases the digit, hoping that the distribution of digits might favor me.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 24754684, which contains zero 3s. The current bid is 3 3s, meaning there must be at least three 3s among the 24 digits. Since I have none, the other two players would need to have all three (or more) 3s between them, which is possible but not guaranteed. However, bidding 3 4s is safer because I have two 4s in my hand, making it more likely that there are at least three 4s among all hands. Therefore, I will raise the bid to 3 4s.

Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 4s and considering my hand 07226802, which contains no 4s but has a distribution of other digits, I must decide whether to challenge or bid higher. Since I have no 4s, the likelihood of there being exactly 4 or more 4s across all players seems uncertain without more information. However, bidding higher requires either increasing the quantity, which seems risky given the total number of digits remaining (24), or increasing the digit, which would require knowledge of the distribution of higher digits. Given the uncertainty and the fact that challenging could provide insight into the game state while potentially eliminating a player, it might be a viable strategy. Yet, considering the game's progression and the fact that players have been bidding fairly aggressively, it's possible that the bid of 4 4s could be reasonable. Without concrete evidence or a clear advantage in bidding higher, and considering the potential risk of challenging without sufficient information, I must weigh the odds carefully. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and we are already at a bid of 4 4s, increasing the quantity further might not be feasible or likely. Therefore, my best course of action, based on the information provided and the need to make a strategic decision, would be to challenge the current bid, as it allows me to test the validity of the bid without needing to commit to a potentially unsustainable higher bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 24754684, which contains only one 2. The current bid is 3 2s, meaning there must be at least three 2s among the 16 total digits. Since I have only one 2, Player 5 would need to have at least two 2s in their hand for their bid to be valid. The probability of Player 5 having two or more 2s in their hand is not negligible, but it's not overwhelmingly likely either. However, since the bid is at a relatively low quantity and I have only one 2, it is safer to increase the bid slightly rather than challenge at this point. I also have two 4s in my hand, so bidding 3 4s is a safe and valid higher bid.
