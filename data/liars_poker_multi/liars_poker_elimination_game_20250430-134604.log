Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player to bid, I need to make a reasonable opening bid based on my hand. I have two 8s and two 2s. Bidding 2 8s is a safe starting point, reflecting the most frequent digit in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s. To beat this, I need to bid at least 3 8s or 2 9s. Since I only have one 8, I cannot bid 3 8s. Bidding 2 9s would be more than my hand can support, as I have no 9s. The total number of 8s across all players is unlikely to be 2 or more, given only 48 total digits and the distribution. Challenging the current bid seems like the best move, as 2 8s is quite low, and the likelihood that there are at least 2 eights overall is high, but not guaranteed. However, considering the distribution, challenging is a reasonable move to test the bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: It is the start of a new round, and I am the first to bid. My hand contains two 8s and two 2s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. A bid of 2 8s is a safe starting bid, reflecting the 8s in my hand and the overall probability.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. With 5 players and 8 digits each (40 total digits), the expected average quantity for any digit is 4. I have one 8 in my hand (32046438). Therefore, the bid of 2 8s is very plausible, requiring only one more 8 among the other 32 hidden digits. Challenging this low bid is extremely risky. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 3s. Bidding 3 3s is a statistically reasonable increase (I have 2, needing only 1 more from 32 digits) and uses information from my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 73631054, which contains two 3s. The current bid is 3 3s by Player 2. Since I have two 3s myself, it's possible that there is at least one more 3 among the other 32 digits across the remaining players. The likelihood of there being at least one more 3 is reasonably high given the total of 40 digits. Therefore, challenging seems risky. Instead, I will make a higher bid. I can bid 4 3s to increase the quantity, which is a conservative increase considering my own two 3s. This bid keeps the pressure on while staying within a plausible range.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 3s and my hand containing two 7s, I must consider the likelihood of higher bids being valid. Since my hand does not contain any 3s, I have to rely on the bidding history and the total digits remaining. The total digits remaining are 40, and with 5 players, each having 8 digits, the distribution of digits is crucial. Considering the previous bids and the fact that I have two 7s, which could potentially be part of a higher bid, I need to weigh the risk of challenging versus making a higher bid. However, without concrete information about the distribution of other digits, especially considering the previous bids were about 8s and 3s, making a bid about 7s seems plausible as it increases the digit value from the current bid of 3s, thus making a 'higher' bid in terms of the digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand ('19938070'), which is a strong showing for this digit. The current bid is 4 7s, and with 40 digits in play, it's plausible that there are at least 4 total 7s among all hands. Statistically, each digit appears about 4 times per player set, but my hand is slightly above average for 7s. Since I have two myself, it's likely that at least two more exist among the other 32 digits. However, I don't have enough certainty to challenge yet. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity to 5 or bid 4 8s. I have two 0s as well, but bidding 4 8s is riskier since I have no 8s. Instead, I'll bid 5 7s, leveraging my strong hand in 7s and putting pressure on others.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 8s, one 7, one 5, one 4, one 2, one 1, and one 0. The current bid is 5 7s. There are 40 total digits remaining. With only one 7 in my hand, a bid of 5 7s seems quite high, as it would require four more 7s to be spread across the other four players' 32 digits. A bid of 5 7s represents 12.5% of the remaining digits being 7s. While not impossible, it feels risky. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s. I could potentially bid 6 8s, which is higher than 5 7s. However, this would require four more 8s among the other players. Given the current bid of 5 7s, challenging seems like a reasonable option as it's a relatively high bid for the number of remaining digits and I don't have many 7s myself.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first to bid this round. My hand is 19938070, which contains two 9s, two 0s, two 3s, one 7, and one 8. Since there are 32 digits in play, a safe opening bid is 2 of a digit I have multiple of. Bidding 2 9s is reasonable, as I hold two 9s myself, making this bid safe regardless of the distribution in other hands.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. There are 4 players and 32 total digits. The expected number of any digit is 3.2 (32/10). A bid of 2 9s is below the expected average and likely true. Challenging seems risky, as the other 3 players (24 digits) only need two 9s between them (expected 2.4). I should make a higher bid. My hand is 32046438. I have two 3s and two 4s. Bidding 3 3s is a safe option, as I hold two of them and only need one more from the remaining 24 digits, where the expected number is 2.4. This is a minimal increase in quantity and leverages my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 73631054, which contains one 3. The current bid is 3 3s by Player 2. With 4 active players and 32 total digits, the average number of a specific digit across all hands would be around 3.2. Since I only have one 3, it’s possible but not highly likely that the total count of 3s is at least 3. However, bidding higher is safer at this stage. I can bid 4 3s to increase the quantity slightly, as it’s a conservative raise and keeps the pressure on others. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 7 (I have two), but staying with 3s feels more strategic to test the current bid's validity without overcommitting. I’ll go with 4 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 3s and looking at my hand 72673762, I notice I have three 7s and no 3s. Since the current bid is about 3s, I don't have any information that would directly help me assess the likelihood of this bid being true or false. However, considering the total number of digits remaining is 32 and the bid is for 4 3s, it's plausible. To make a higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Given my hand, bidding on 7s seems promising because I have multiple 7s. Since the previous round had a bid of 5 7s which was true, and considering the elimination of players, it's possible that the count of 7s could still be high. Thus, making a bid that is higher than 4 3s, such as bidding on 7s, seems like a strategic move. Given that I have three 7s and the previous round's bid of 5 7s was successful, I could bid 5 7s again, hoping that the total count of 7s across all players is still at least 5.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 19938070. I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 5 7s, which means there must be at least five 7s among the 32 digits. Since I have only one, there must be at least four among the other 24 digits (other players' hands). The probability of this is not exceedingly low, but it's not a certainty. However, since I do not have enough information to be confident that the bid is unlikely, and I must either challenge or make a higher bid, I will make the minimal valid higher bid: 5 8s. This keeps the pressure on the next player while not overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I hold one 8 (32046438). This means the remaining 3 players (Player 3, Player 4, Player 5) must hold at least four 8s among their combined 24 digits for the bid to be true. The expected number of 8s in 24 digits is 2.4 (24 * 0.1). Requiring 4 or more 8s from the other players is statistically unlikely (probability is roughly 23%). Player 5 made the bid after previously bidding 2 9s and seeing bids on 3s and 7s escalate, suggesting this jump to 5 8s might be a bluff or an overbid. Given the statistical improbability, challenging the bid is the most strategically sound action.

Player 2 Reasoning: I am the starting bidder for this round with 3 players and 24 total digits. My hand is 32046438, containing two 3s and two 4s as the most frequent digits. The expected average quantity for any digit is 2.4 (24 digits / 10 possible digits). Since I hold two 3s, bidding '3 3s' is a statistically reasonable opening bid, assuming at least one more 3 exists among the 16 digits held by the other two players. This bid is supported by my hand and sets a moderate starting point for the round.

Since I have two 3s myself, it is plausible that there is at least one more 3 among the other 16 digits across Player 2 and Player 4, making the total of 3 3s believable. Challenging now carries a high risk of losing since the bid seems reasonable. Instead, I will make a higher bid. I can bid 4 3s to increase the quantity.

Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 3s' by Player 3 and my hand '72673762', I notice that I have multiple 7s. However, I must consider the possibility of other players having 3s to determine if challenging is viable. Since I have no 3s in my hand, I must rely on the bidding history and the total number of digits remaining (24) to make my decision. The bidding history shows that players have been bidding relatively low quantities, and the presence of multiple 7s in my hand suggests that bidding on a higher digit could be strategic. Considering the total number of digits and the fact that I have a significant number of 7s, I could bid on 7s. However, the current bid is on 3s, and I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a new bid that is strictly higher. Given that challenging requires certainty about the bid being unlikely and considering my lack of information about other players' hands, making a new bid seems more strategic. Since my hand contains multiple 7s and no 3s, increasing the quantity or digit from the current bid '4 3s' to something involving 7s could be a good strategy, but I must ensure my bid is reasonable given the total digits remaining and the history of bids.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s made by Player 4. My hand is 32046438, containing zero 7s. For the bid to be accurate, the other two players (Player 3 and Player 4) must possess at least five 7s within their combined 16 digits. With a total of 24 digits remaining, the expected number of 7s across the other 16 digits is only 1.6 (16 * 0.1). The probability of finding 5 or more 7s in those 16 digits is statistically very low. While bidding higher (e.g., 6 3s or 6 4s, based on my two 3s and two 4s) is an option, a bid of 6 represents 25% of the total digits, which is quite high. Given that I hold no 7s myself, challenging the unlikely bid of 5 7s appears to be the most strategically sound decision.

Player 2 Reasoning: It's my turn to make the first bid of the round. My hand is 32046438, containing two 3s and two 4s. There are 16 total digits between me and Player 3. The expected average count for any digit is 1.6. Having two 3s is above average. In previous rounds (with more players), Player 3 consistently bid 4 3s after I bid 3 3s, suggesting they likely hold multiple 3s. Therefore, bidding 3 3s is a strong opening move. It's supported by my hand (I have two 3s) and leverages the strong possibility that Player 3 also holds 3s, making the total count likely to be at least 3, probably higher.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 73631054, which contains two 3s. The current bid by Player 2 is 3 3s, meaning they are claiming there are at least three 3s across both our hands (16 digits total). Since I have two 3s, it's possible that Player 2 has at least one 3, making the total count at least three. However, I need to make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity to 4 3s or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity, like 3 4s. Given that I have two 3s, bidding 4 3s seems reasonable as it’s plausible if Player 2 has at least two 3s. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have strength in, like 7 (I have one), but since the bid must be higher, I’ll stick with 4 3s to keep the pressure on Player 2. I don’t think challenging is wise here since 3 3s is quite plausible with my two 3s contributing to the count.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s, made by Player 3. I (Player 2) have two 3s in my hand (32046438). For the bid of 4 3s to be true, Player 3 must have at least two 3s among their 8 digits. This is plausible. Challenging is risky because if Player 3 has two or more 3s, I lose. I previously bid 3 3s, signaling I had some 3s. Player 3's raise to 4 3s could be based on their own 3s or a bluff. Instead of challenging, I can make a higher bid. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 4 4s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires Player 3 to have at least two 4s, which is similarly plausible to them having two 3s. This shifts the pressure back to Player 3 on a different digit where I also have some strength (two 4s). Bidding 5 of any digit feels too high given my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 73631054, which contains one 4. The current bid by Player 2 is 4 4s, meaning they are claiming there are at least four 4s across both hands (16 total digits). Since I only have one 4, Player 2 would need to have at least three 4s in their hand of 8 digits for the bid to hold. This is possible but not highly likely, as it assumes a significant concentration of 4s in their hand. However, challenging carries a risk—if they do have three or more 4s, I lose. On the other hand, I can make a safer bid. My hand has two 3s, and the bid history shows consistent bidding on 3s, so I could bid 5 3s, but since the current bid is 4 4s, I need to bid higher. I’ll go with 5 4s, assuming there might be a few more 4s in Player 2’s hand, making it a plausible bid while avoiding an immediate challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s, made by Player 3. I have two 4s in my hand (32046438). For the bid to be true, Player 3 must hold at least three 4s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is low (approximately 3.8%). Given this low probability, Player 3's bid is likely a bluff, especially since I previously bid 4 4s based on my two 4s. Making a higher bid, such as 6 of any digit, would require Player 3 to hold at least four of that digit (if I hold two) or more, which is even less likely.
