Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first bidder and the current bid is None. I have one 1, two 0s, one 3, one 5, and two 7s in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8. Bidding 3 0s seems reasonable given I have two 0s and the average expectation, and it's a low enough bid to encourage others to bid higher.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total), and the bid being only 3 0s, this is a reasonable bid to build upon. Since I have two 5s in my hand, I can confidently bid '3 5s', which is valid as it keeps the same quantity but uses a higher digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 64962435, which contains one 5. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits in play. The current bid is 3 5s, which is reasonable at this stage, so challenging is not optimal. The minimum valid raise is 3 6s, as 6 is higher than 5. My hand contains two 6s, making 3 6s a plausible and safe bid that increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Given that there are 48 digits remaining in total, it is possible that there are at least 4 6s among all players. I should make a bid that is higher than the current bid. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move to increase the quantity while keeping the same digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I could bid 5 6s, or 4 of a higher number such as 7 or 8. Given that I have two 7s and two 8s, bidding 4 7s seems like a reasonable move. It's a safe bid, and I'm not increasing the quantity too much.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand is 09184534, which contains one 7. I have to make a higher bid than 4 7s, either by increasing the quantity or bidding the same quantity on a higher digit. Since I have one 7, I believe there's a reasonable chance that the total count of 7s is at least 4 or more, given that there are 5 other players. I can either bid a higher quantity on 7s or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit, which is 8s or 9s. Bidding 5 7s seems plausible as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, bidding 4 8s or 4 9s is also an option. Given my hand, I see one 8 and no 9s, so 4 8s seems like a reasonable and believable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s, one 1, one 3, two 5s, one 6, and two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s.  Based on my hand, I have no 8s. The average number of any digit across 48 digits is 4.8.  A bid of 4 8s is plausible, but I have no information to support it.  Challenging seems risky as it's a common bid quantity.  I need to make a higher bid.  I have two 7s, and 4 7s was already bid. I have two 0s and two 5s. I can bid 5 of a digit.  Bidding 5 0s or 5 5s are both valid higher bids.  Since I have two 5s, bidding 5 5s seems slightly more likely to be true across all hands than 5 0s, although both are speculative.  However, looking at the bid history, Player 1 bid 3 5s. Bidding 5 5s is a significant jump.  Considering the bids have been steadily increasing in quantity or digit, a bid of 5 0s or 5 5s are the next logical steps.  I will choose 5 0s as I have two 0s and it's a valid increase from 4 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. Player 0 has bid 5 0s, which means they believe there are at least 5 zeros across all 48 digits. While this is possible, it seems risky given: 1) I only see one 0 in my hand, 2) Player 0 started with a lower bid of 3 0s and has now significantly increased it, suggesting potential bluffing, and 3) The bid jumped from 4 8s back to 0s with a higher quantity, which is a defensive move. Based on probability and the bidding pattern, I think challenging is safer than making a higher bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round. My hand is 50601377. I have two 0s, one 1, one 3, one 5, one 6, and two 7s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, a bid of 2 0s is a safe starting point based on my hand and the probability of others having 0s.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 64962435, which contains no 0s. The current bid is 2 0s, which is a low and very safe opening bid considering there are 40 digits in play. Statistically, with 5 players and 8 digits each, it's likely there are at least 2 zeros among all hands. There is no reason to challenge such a low bid this early. The best move is to make a strictly higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 2 6s is both legal and supported by my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s. I know that there are at least two 6s out there. I have some information about the other players' hands. Player 2 previously bid 3 6s, so there are probably at least 3 6s in play. Player 5 previously bid 4 8s, so they probably have at least one 6. Player 4 previously bid 4 7s, so they probably have at least one 6. Player 0 previously bid 5 0s, so they probably have no 6s. I don't have any information about Player 1. Assuming Player 1 has no 6s, there are probably 4 6s in play. I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: It's the start of a new round with 4 players and 32 digits. I have two 6s in my hand. Since there is no current bid, I must make the opening bid. Based on my hand, bidding 2 6s is a safe and reasonable opening, as I know I have two 6s myself.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I could bid 3 0s, which is a safe increase. However, since Player 2 just bid 2 6s, and I have one 6, it's possible there are more than 2 6s in total. I'll bid 3 6s, which is a small but valid increase.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have the hand 09184534, which contains one 6. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have one 6, and there are 3 other players, it's possible that there are more 6s. However, bidding more than 3 6s without a strong reason might be risky. I can bid 3 7s, keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit, which is a safer move given the current information.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. My hand has two 7s. With 4 players and 32 total digits, the average count for any digit is 3.2. The current bid is exactly the average count for 7s, which is reasonable. However, I have two 7s, making it more likely that there are at least three 7s in total. Bidding 4 7s is a slight increase in quantity based on my hand's strength in 7s and is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. With 32 total digits among 4 players, the expected number of any digit is about 3.2. Bidding 4 7s is slightly above expectation, but not unreasonable. However, with only one 7 in my hand, it's risky to challenge now, as it's possible the other players collectively have three more 7s. I should make a higher bid, and since I have two 6s, bidding 4 8s or 5 6s are options. However, bidding 4 8s is only incrementing the digit, but I have no 8s. Bidding 5 6s is a bigger jump but I have two 6s. Given that, I will bid 4 8s to keep the pressure up while not overcommitting.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. I could bid 5 8s, or bid 4 9s or 5 of any digit. Given I only have one 8, bidding 5 8s is risky. Bidding 4 9s is safe and slightly increases the bid without relying on my hand. I don't have any 9s, so it's a pure bluff.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 4. My hand is 09184534, which contains one 9. I have to make a bid that is higher than 4 9s. I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since I see that there's at least one 9 in my hand, it's plausible that the total count of 9s could be higher than 4. However, bidding more than 5 9s seems risky given the total count of digits is 32. I can bid 4 0s, increasing the digit. However, I have two 0s in my hand, so it's reasonable to assume there could be more 0s. I will bid 5 0s, increasing the quantity, which is a relatively safe and higher bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 50601377, which contains two 0s. The current bid is 5 0s. With 4 players and 32 total digits, an average of 3.2 of each digit is expected. The previous round showed a high count of 0s (7 with 6 players). While 5 0s is slightly above average, it's not unreasonable, especially considering the previous round's count. I have two 0s, so the other three players would need at least three more 0s combined. Given the history and my hand, challenging seems risky. I should make a higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 5 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is supported by my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 64962435, which contains one 7 and one 0. The current bid is 5 7s. There are 32 digits in play, and each digit is equally likely to occur, so the expected number of any digit is about 3-4. Having only one 7 in my hand, the bid of 5 7s seems aggressive but not impossible. However, since I can only bid higher, my options are 5 8s, 5 9s, or 6 of any digit. I have one 8 and one 9 in my hand, but bidding 5 8s or 5 9s is risky since I only have one of each. Bidding 6 0s is also risky as I have only one 0. The safest higher bid is 5 8s, as I have one 8 and it's only incrementally riskier than the current bid, and it keeps me in the game without overcommitting.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have the hand 09184534, which contains one 0. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 32 total digits and the current bid is 6 0s, it's possible that the total count of 0s is at least 6 because in the previous round, the count of 0s was 7 out of 40 digits. However, I should analyze my hand and the history. My hand has one 0, so I have 1 out of 8 digits as 0. To make a higher bid, I can bid 6 1s or higher. I will choose to bid 6 1s because it's a valid higher bid by increasing the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. With 4 players and 32 total digits, the average count of any digit is 3.2. A bid of 6 1s seems high given this average and my hand. However, the previous round showed a bid of 5 0s being challenged and the actual count was 7, and a bid of 2 6s was challenged and the actual count was 5. This suggests there might be some strong hands out there. I have two 0s, one 1, one 3, one 5, two 7s, and one 6. I could potentially bid higher on 0s or 7s based on my hand. Bidding 6 2s would be a safe increase. Bidding 7 0s or 7 7s would be based on my hand. Given the recent history of high counts, challenging 6 1s feels risky, especially since I have one 1. Bidding 7 0s seems like a reasonable step up based on my two 0s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. In my hand, I have only one 0. With 32 digits in play and each player holding 8 digits, the expected average per digit is 3.2. A bid of 7 0s is quite high and would require almost every player to have at least two 0s, which is statistically unlikely. I have only one, so unless both other players have 3 or more each, this bid is probably an overreach. Therefore, I should challenge.

The digit I have the most of is 6 and 4, each appearing twice. With 24 digits in play and 3 players, it's likely that at least 2 or 3 of any digit could appear.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 4. My hand is 09184534, which contains one 6. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have one 6, and there are two other players, it's possible that there are more 6s. However, bidding more than 3 6s with a quantity increase seems reasonable if I consider the total count across all players. I can bid 4 6s. Alternatively, bidding 3 7s or higher is also an option. Given my hand has a 9 and an 8, and no 7s, I'm inclined to think there might be fewer 7s than 6s or other higher digits. I will increase the quantity and bid 4 6s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s. With 24 digits in play and only needing to cover 4 total 6s, it's plausible that the other two players together have at least two more 6s. Since it's early in the round and the bid isn't extreme, I shouldn't challenge yet. The next valid bid is either 4 7s or 5 of any digit. I don't have any 7s, but I do have two 4s, two 6s, one 9, one 2, one 3, and one 5. The most promising is to increase the quantity rather than the digit, so I'll bid 5 6s, leveraging my own two 6s and pressuring the others.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Since there are only 24 digits total, bidding 6 6s seems reasonable and not too risky. I don't have enough information to confidently challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have the hand 09184534, which contains one 6. Given that there are 24 digits in total among the three players, and I have one 6, it's possible that the total count of 6s is around 6. However, to make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 6 7s would be a reasonable next step as it increases the digit, and I have one 7 in my hand, making it plausible that there could be 6 or more 7s in total. Challenging seems risky as the count could be 6 or more.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. In my hand (64962435), I have one 7. With 24 digits in play, the expected number of any particular digit is about 2.4. For there to be 6 or more 7s, the other two players would need to hold a combined 5 or more 7s, which is unlikely but not impossible. However, Player 5 just raised from 6 6s to 6 7s, which could indicate they have multiple 7s. Still, the likelihood of there being 6 or more 7s is low. Given the statistical improbability and my own hand, I will challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I am Player 2 and it is my turn to open the bidding in a fresh round with only two players (16 digits total). My hand is 64962435, which contains two 6s, two 4s, one 9, two 2s, one 3, and one 5. Opening with a conservative bid that reflects a digit I have multiple of is optimal, as it puts early pressure on my opponent and gives me flexibility for future raises. I will bid '2 6s' since I have two 6s, making it a safe minimum opening bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Since there are only 16 total digits, I think bidding 3 6s is a reasonable move. It's a small increase and I have some information about my own hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand (digits: 64962435). The current bid is 3 6s, which is plausible since there are 16 digits in play and I hold two of the 6s myself. It is likely that Player 4 has at least one 6, so a challenge here would be risky. The next valid bid must be either 4 6s or 3 7s (or higher). I have only two 6s and one 7, so I don't have strong evidence for either, but 4 6s is a reasonable, conservative escalation given the total digits. I will bid 4 6s to continue the round and apply pressure.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 64962435. I have three 6s (positions 1, 4, and 5). The current bid is 5 6s. That means Player 4 is claiming there are at least 5 sixes in both hands. Since I have three, Player 4 would need at least two 6s for their bid to be valid. While it's possible, it's not especially likely—each digit has a 1/10 chance, so expected is 1.6 per hand. Given that Player 4 has consistently pushed 6s, they might have two, but it's still a stretch. However, it's not so unlikely that I can be certain. Since challenging on 5 6s is risky and I can still make a safe higher bid, I'll bid 6 6s, as that's the minimal valid next bid and puts pressure back on Player 4.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. The total digits remaining are 16. Bidding 7 6s is a valid bid and slightly increases the pressure on my opponent. It's a small increment, but it forces them to consider if there are at least seven 6s between our hands.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 64962435, which contains three 6s. The current bid is 7 6s. With only 16 digits in play and me holding three 6s, Player 4 would need to have at least four 6s for the bid to be valid. Given the probability, it's unlikely Player 4 has four or more 6s in their hand. The bidding history also shows a strong focus on 6s, suggesting Player 4 may be bluffing or pushing their luck. I should challenge.
