Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold three 6s in my hand. Opening with 4 6s requires just one additional 6 among the other 40 digits, which is highly likely (~98.5%), making this a safe yet progressive opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 50365837, which contains one 6. The current bid is 4 6s by Player 0. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an average of 4.8 digits per digit value across all hands is expected if digits are uniformly distributed. A bid of 4 6s is slightly below this average, making it plausible. However, since I only have one 6, I estimate that the other 5 players must contribute at least 3 more 6s for the bid to hold, which is possible but not guaranteed. I could challenge, but the risk of losing is significant given the reasonable bid. Instead, I will make a higher bid to continue the game. I’ll bid 5 6s, increasing the quantity, as I believe it’s still within a plausible range and forces the next player to make a tougher decision.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet in this round and I am starting the bidding, I need to make a conservative yet strategic bid. My hand is 50365837, which contains one 5, one 0, one 3, two 6s, one 8, and one 7. With 40 total digits across 5 players, I can estimate the distribution. Bidding on 6s seems reasonable since I have two of them, increasing the likelihood that there are more in other hands. A bid of 4 6s feels safe as an opening bid, as it is below the previous round's challenged bid of 5 6s which turned out to be exact, suggesting 6s might be moderately common.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. I need to make a higher bid. I could bid 5 6s, but that might be risky since Player 1 already bid 5 6s in the previous round and won the challenge. Instead, I should bid 4 7s, which is a safer bet given that I have one 7 in my hand and it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have a 7 in my hand. Given the history of bids, it seems reasonable to increase the digit since the bid is not likely to be extremely high. I'll bid 4 8s.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 8s and I have one 8 in my hand (97351003), I must decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Since the total digits remaining are 40 and there are 5 players, the maximum possible count for any digit is 40. Considering the previous bids and the fact that I only have one 8, bidding a higher quantity of 8s seems risky. However, I could bid a higher digit with the same quantity, but since we're already at 8, the next digit would be 9. Given that I have no 9s in my hand and the risk of bidding something that might not exist in sufficient quantity, challenging the current bid seems like a safer option, especially since the bidder (Player 4) might be bluffing or overestimating the number of 8s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is None. I have 8 in my hand. Given the total digits remaining is 32, I should make a bid with the highest digit possible, which is 8. I'll start with bidding 1 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s is strictly higher than 1 8s (quantity increase to 3) and guarantees at least three 6s in total since I hold all three myself. Challenging me would be futile, so this is a safe bid.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:2 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 50365837, which contains two 6s. The current bid is 3 6s by Player 0. Since I have two 6s myself, it's plausible that there is at least one more 6 among the other 24 digits across the three other players (each with 8 digits). The total digits remaining are 32, so a bid of 3 6s is not overly aggressive. However, I need to make a higher bid than 3 6s. I can either increase the quantity to 4 6s or bid 3 of a higher digit. Given that I have two 6s, bidding 4 6s feels safer than switching to a higher digit where I might have fewer or no instances in my hand (e.g., I have only one 7, one 8, and no 9s). Bidding 4 6s assumes just two more 6s exist among the other players, which is reasonable. Challenging seems risky since the bid of 3 6s is believable with my contribution of two. Therefore, I will bid 4 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 7s and two 8s in my hand. Since the last two challenges failed, it is likely that the bids were accurate. Bidding 5 6s is risky because there might not be enough 6s left. Bidding 4 7s or 4 8s is also risky because other players might have these digits. Challenging the current bid of 4 6s seems unlikely to succeed given the recent history. Therefore, I will bid 5 7s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same as the last bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s made by Player 3. I have 8 in my hand. Since the digit '8' is higher than '7', I can make a bid with a higher digit. However, I should be cautious not to overbid, as there are only 32 total digits remaining. I'll make a bid with a quantity of 1 and the digit 8, which is the highest possible digit I can bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s, and I have 4 7s in my hand. Given the current bid is already quite high, I should aim to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same to make a valid bid. My hand has no other high digits, so bidding 5 8s seems like a good option.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have only one 8 in my hand, so there must be at least four 8s among the other 24 unknown digits to meet the bid of 5 8s. The probability of seeing at least four 8s in 24 draws (p=0.1) is only about 21%. Challenging is the best play.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:2 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 50365837, which contains one 7. The current bid by Player 4 is 4 7s across all 24 digits in play (3 players with 8 digits each). Since I only have one 7, for the bid to be true, the other two players must collectively have at least 3 more 7s among their 16 digits. This is possible but not highly likely, as it would require a significant concentration of 7s in their hands. However, looking at the bidding history, Player 4 has been aggressive with bids on higher digits and has won challenges before. Given the risk of challenging and being eliminated if wrong, I’ll opt for a safer bid. I’ll increase the bid to 5 7s, as it’s a modest increase and keeps the pressure on while staying within a plausible range based on my single 7.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have two 8s in my hand, which suggests that there might be a reasonable number of 8s in other players' hands as well. Challenging 5 7s seems risky because there could easily be 5 7s among the three players. Bidding 6 7s is a safe increment, as it's likely there are at least 6 7s among the three players' hands. This bid increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same, which is a reasonable strategy given the current game state.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s by Player 4. In my hand (50365837), I have only one 7. With a total of 24 digits across three players, a bid of 7 7s means that the other two players must collectively have at least 6 more 7s for the bid to hold. Given that each player has 8 digits, it's possible but statistically unlikely for such a high concentration of a single digit. Looking at the bidding history, Player 4 has been aggressive with bids on 7s and 8s, and previous challenges on high bids have sometimes favored the bidder, but with only 24 digits left, 7 7s feels like a stretch. I could bid higher, such as 8 7s or 7 8s, but that would be an even riskier bid. Instead, I believe challenging now has a reasonable chance of success given the low probability of 7 7s being accurate.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: As the starting bidder in this round with only two active players and a total of 16 digits, I need to make a conservative yet strategic bid. My hand is 50365837, which includes one 5, one 0, one 3, one 6, one 8, and one 7, with two additional digits. Since there are no prior bids in this round, I can start with a modest bid. I will bid 3 5s, as I have one 5 in my hand, and it's plausible that there could be at least two more 5s in Player 3's hand. This keeps the bid low enough to avoid an immediate challenge while setting a baseline for the round.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have 2 fives in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s, which means there must be at least 1 five in the other player's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 50365837, which contains two 5s. The current bid by Player 3 is 4 5s, meaning they are claiming there are at least four 5s across our combined 16 digits. Since I only have two 5s, Player 3 must have at least two 5s for the bid to hold, which is possible but not guaranteed. However, with only 16 total digits, bidding higher on 5s (to 5 or more) feels risky as it would require an even higher concentration of 5s. Switching to a higher digit like 6s or 7s at quantity 4 is an option, but I only have one 6 and one 7, making those bids less confident. Given the history of aggressive bidding and the fact that 4 5s is plausible but not certain with my contribution of only two, I think challenging is a reasonable risk. If Player 3 has fewer than two 5s, the total will be less than 4, and I win the challenge.
