Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the round. I have three 5s in my hand. A conservative bid of 2 5s is reasonable to start, as it's based on my own hand and doesn't make an overly bold claim. It's a safe opening bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand, so bidding 3 3s guarantees there are at least three 3s total and strictly increases the previous bid of 2 5s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I don't have any 3s in my hand, so I don't want to bid higher on 3s. I can bid 4 of any other digit, or 3 of a digit higher than 3. I have three 7s in my hand. I will bid 3 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s made by Player 2. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than this. I have the digits 7, 1, 4, 7, 1, 0, 2, 6 in my hand, which means there are at least 2 7s in total (from my hand alone). To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 4 7s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and is supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. The expected number of any digit across 6 players (48 total digits) is 4.8. The bid of 4 7s is slightly below this average, making it plausible. Challenging is risky. My hand (22942837) contains three 2s and one 7. Bidding higher than 4 7s is required. Bidding 5 2s is a valid higher bid (5 > 4). This bid is strongly supported by my hand, as I hold 3 of the 5 required 2s. This means the other 5 players only need to have 2 more 2s among their 40 digits, which is less than the expected 4 (40 * 0.1). This makes 5 2s a relatively safe and strategic bid based on my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 5 2s. Bidding 5 3s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 3 and follows the rules for escalating bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. The previous bids were 2 5s, 3 3s, 3 7s, 4 7s, and 5 2s. Player 5's bid of 5 3s seems plausible, but not overwhelmingly so. I have three 5s, so bidding higher on 5s is a good option. Bidding 6 5s is a valid and reasonable increase, as it's higher in quantity than the current bid. It leverages my hand and doesn't immediately expose me to a challenge I'm likely to lose.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand and no 5s. To bid 7 3s I need four more 3s among the 40 unknown digits. The probability of at least four 3s in 40 cards (p=0.1) is about 56%, which is much more favorable than the ~22% chance that six 5s exist. Therefore I should raise to 7 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 3s. I don't have any 3s in my hand. To bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. I could bid 7 4s, but I'll play it safe and increase the quantity to 8 3s, even though I don't have any 3s. This will put the pressure on the next player.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 3s made by Player 2. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than 8 3s. I have the digits 7, 1, 4, 7, 1, 0, 2, 6 in my hand. I can see that there are multiple 3s already bid, and the quantity of 8 seems high but possible. I will bid 9 0s as it is a higher quantity and utilizes a digit that has not been bid yet, making it a reasonable and strategic bid.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:2 - openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 0s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. The expected number of any digit is 4.8. A bid of 9 is significantly higher than expected. My hand contains zero 0s, meaning all 9 or more 0s must be among the other 5 players' 40 digits. The probability of having 9 or more 0s in 40 digits (with a 1/10 chance per digit) is approximately 9.8%. This is a low probability. Furthermore, the bidding history shows an escalation on 3s, and Player 3 suddenly switched to a high quantity on 0s, which could indicate a bluff or an attempt to force a challenge. Given the low probability of the bid being true and my certainty about having zero 0s, challenging is the most strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round. My hand is 22942837, containing three 2s. With 40 total digits across 5 players, a bid of 3 2s is a conservative and safe starting point based directly on my hand's strongest digit. This leaves plenty of room for subsequent bids.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s. With 40 total digits remaining and an expected 3.2 2s, the bid is plausible. Bidding 4 2s increases the quantity slightly and remains within reasonable probability, forcing others to either bid higher or challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have zero 2s in my hand. Given that there are 5 players with 8 digits each, totaling 40 digits, and the last bid was 4 2s, it seems unlikely that there are actually 4 2s across all hands. I will challenge this bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 3 1s is reasonable, as it's likely there's at least one more 1 in the other players' hands. This is a conservative opening bid based on my hand's composition.

Player 1 Reasoning: I hold three 3s in my hand. The current bid is 3 1s, so raising to 4 3s is a safe increase—I only need one more 3 among the other 24 cards, which is very likely.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I don't have any 3s, but I can still make a valid bid. I can bid 4 4s, which is a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have a 4 in my hand, this seems like a reasonable move.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand contains three 2s. There are 32 total digits across 4 players. The average count for any digit is 3.2. A bid of 4 4s is plausible, especially since I hold one 4. Challenging is risky. Based on my hand, I have a strong count of 2s (three). Bidding 5 2s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity than 4 4s) and is well-supported by my hand, as I only need two more 2s from the remaining 24 digits held by other players. This seems like a safe and strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have one 2 in my hand, so the remaining three players must have at least four 2s for the bid to be true. Given the expected distribution of digits (32 total digits across 10 possibilities), 5 2s is plausible but not certain. Bidding 5 3s increases the digit value while maintaining the same quantity, leveraging my one 3 in hand. This forces opponents to either raise further or risk challenging a bid that may be harder to verify. Challenging carries higher risk since the bid could still be valid if other players have sufficient 2s.

Player 1 Reasoning: I hold three 3s in my hand. The current bid of 5 3s is plausible (~70% chance), so challenging risks elimination. Bidding five of a higher digit is even less likely (<15%). The safest raise is to 6 3s, which requires three more 3s from 24 unknown (~40% chance), making it the most credible increase.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 4s. There are 4 players with 8 digits each, totaling 32 digits. The average expected count for any digit is 32 / 10 = 3.2. I hold one 4 in my hand. For the bid of 7 4s to be true, there must be at least 6 more 4s among the other 24 digits held by the other three players. The expected number of 4s among 24 digits is 2.4. The probability of having 6 or more 4s out of 24 digits is statistically low. Player 2 previously bid 4 4s and made a significant jump to 7 4s. Based on the low probability, challenging this bid is the most strategic move.
