Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 37507674, which contains two 7s, making it a relatively strong digit for me. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an initial bid of 3 7s seems reasonable as it is conservative yet assertive, assuming at least one other 7 might be out there. This bid sets a moderate starting point and allows room for escalation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to evaluate whether to challenge the bid of '3 7s' or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand '00885405', I don't have any 7s. This means all 3 claimed 7s would need to be in the other 5 players' hands (40 remaining digits). While this is certainly possible, it's not particularly suspicious as it only requires about 7.5% of the remaining digits to be 7s. Based on my hand, I have two 8s, two 0s, one 5, one 4, and no 7s. I could safely bid '3 8s' since I already have two 8s in my hand and only need one more among the other players. This is a conservative and safe bid that builds on my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand of 91614771, I have zero 8s. With 6 active players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. Player 1 claims there are at least 3 8s total. Since I don't have any 8s, all 3 would need to be among the other 40 digits I can't see. While possible, I could make a safer bid. I see I have two 7s in my hand, which supports Player 0's original bid of 3 7s. I could bid '3 9s' to stay safe while moving up, as it's a higher digit than 8 with the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4.8.  A bid of 3 9s is plausible, but I have a strong hand for 2s (four 2s). I can comfortably bid higher than 3 9s based on my 2s. Bidding 4 2s is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 2s and considering my hand contains a 2, I need to assess the likelihood of this bid being true. With 48 total digits remaining and 6 players, each having 8 digits, the maximum count for any digit is 48. The bid of 4 2s seems plausible but not extremely high, considering the total possible count for any digit. Since I have a 2 in my hand, I know there's at least one 2. However, without more information about other players' hands, it's difficult to accurately assess the total count of 2s. Given that the previous bids were for higher digits (7s, 8s, 9s) and this bid is for a lower digit (2s) but with a higher quantity, it indicates a strategic move by Player 3. My hand does not provide enough information to confidently challenge this bid or make a significantly higher bid. Thus, I should consider making a bid that is higher in quantity or digit, if possible, based on my hand and the bidding history. Since my hand contains digits that have not been bid on yet, such as 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, I could potentially bid on one of these if I had enough information or a strong feeling about their distribution. However, given the information and the need to make a strictly higher bid, I must carefully consider the next step. Bidding on a digit I have multiple of could be a good strategy, but I only have one of each digit besides the repeated 4 and 7. Given the constraints and the current bid, making a bid on a higher digit with the same quantity or increasing the quantity on a lower digit than 2 seems like the best approach. Since I have two 4s and no other digit repeated, bidding on 4s could be a good option, considering it's higher than 2 and I have a basis for it in my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid of 4 4s is plausible (expected about 4.8 4s in 48 digits). Rather than challenge, I’ll raise to 4 6s since I hold two 6s and need only two more in the remaining 40 digits, which is likely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 37507674, which contains one 6. The current bid is 4 6s by Player 5. With 48 total digits across 6 players, it's possible that there are at least 4 6s in play, especially since I have one. However, I need to make a higher bid than 4 6s. I can either increase the quantity to 5 or more of any digit, or bid 4 of a higher digit (7, 8, or 9). Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, which is a strong basis for bidding on 7s. Bidding 4 7s feels safer than increasing the quantity to 5, as the likelihood of there being at least 4 7s seems reasonable given my two 7s. I’ll avoid challenging since 4 6s is plausible with only my contribution of one 6.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge Player 0's bid of 4 7s. Looking at my hand (00885405), I don't have any 7s. The current bid claims there are at least 4 sevens among all 48 digits. This is certainly possible, but I need to assess if it's worth challenging or making a higher bid. Since I have two 8s in my hand, I could confidently bid 4 8s, which would be higher than 4 7s. This seems like a safer move than challenging, as having 4 sevens across 6 players (48 digits) is quite reasonable. The probability of having at least 4 sevens in the remaining 40 digits (not in my hand) is fairly high.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (91614771), I have zero 8s. The current bid of '4 8s' means there need to be at least 4 eights among all 48 digits. While this is mathematically possible, the bidding sequence has been steadily escalating, and Player 1 has now bid on 8s twice, which could indicate bluffing. Given I have no 8s in my hand and would need 4 to exist among the other 40 digits, this seems unlikely enough to warrant a challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: I'm starting this round, so I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, two 8s, one 5, one 4, and no other digits. Since I have two 8s in my hand, bidding on 8s would be a good start. In the previous round, I successfully bid 4 8s and won a challenge, so there were at least 4 8s total. Even though one player was eliminated, I still have my two 8s, so it's reasonable to assume there are still several 8s in play. I'll start with a conservative bid of 3 8s, which should be safe given what I know about my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 4 (40 / 10). A bid of 3 8s is below the expected value, and Player 1 just won a challenge on 4 8s, suggesting there might be a few 8s out there. Given my hand and the previous history, bidding 4 8s seems like a reasonable increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 8s and I have no 8s in my hand, I must consider the likelihood of this bid being true. With 40 total digits remaining and the bid being for 4 8s, it's possible but not extremely high given the distribution of digits. However, since I don't have any 8s, I have to rely on the probability and the bidding history. The previous round had a challenge on 4 8s which was won by the bidder, indicating there might be a significant number of 8s. Considering the total digits and the fact that I don't have any 8s, challenging seems like a reasonable option, but I must also consider making a higher bid if I think I can safely do so. Given that the current bid is 4 8s, making a higher bid would require bidding at least 5 of any digit or the same quantity of a higher digit, which is not feasible given the digits I hold and the total remaining. Thus, challenging the current bid seems the most strategic move as bidding higher than 4 8s with my hand and the current state seems risky.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 37507674, and I have no 2s. The current bid by Player 3 is 4 2s, meaning there should be at least 4 twos across all 24 digits in play among the three active players. Since I have none, the other two players (Player 1 and Player 3) must collectively have at least 4 twos in their 16 digits. While this is possible, it seems somewhat unlikely given the average distribution (about 1.6 twos per player if evenly distributed across digits). However, in the history, a previous bid of 4 2s was successful with a count of 5 when there were 32 digits, suggesting Player 3 might be confident in 2s again. With only 24 digits now, the probability is lower, but I’ll err on the side of caution and bid higher rather than challenge, as challenging incorrectly would eliminate me. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 4 7s feels safer since I contribute to the count. This bid is higher than 4 2s in terms of digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. My hand is 00885405, which contains no 7s. The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 0. With 3 players remaining and 8 digits per player, there are 24 total digits in play. For the bid of 4 7s to be true, Player 0 and Player 3 would need to have all 4 of the 7s between them. This is possible but not guaranteed. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, two 0s, one 5, one 4, and no 7s. I could bid 5 0s since I have two 0s myself, but that's risky without knowing what others have. I could also bid 4 8s since I have two 8s, making it more likely to reach 4 total. Another option is to challenge the current bid. Based on previous rounds, Player 1 (me) had a successful bid of 4 8s before, which suggests there were at least 4 8s in the previous round. Since I have two 8s in my hand, I could safely bid 4 8s again. However, since I have zero 7s in my hand, and the bid is already at 4 7s, I think challenging is the safer move here.

Player 0 Reasoning: As the starting bidder in this round with no current bid to beat, I can make a conservative opening bid. My hand is 37507674, which contains three 7s. Since there are only 16 total digits in play between me and Player 3, bidding 4 7s is a reasonable start. It leverages my strong count of 7s and leaves room for escalation while not being too aggressive early on.

While possible, it's not overwhelmingly likely. However, I have four 2s in my hand. Bidding 5 2s is a strong bid based on my hand and is a higher bid than 4 7s. Alternatively, bidding 5 7s seems too risky as it would require the other player to have four 7s. Bidding 5 2s is a safer and stronger move based on my hand's composition.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 37507674, which contains two 7s, but no 2s. The current bid by Player 3 is 5 2s. With only 16 total digits in play (8 mine, 8 theirs), a bid of 5 2s means Player 3 must have at least 5 2s in their hand if I have none, which is possible but somewhat unlikely given the distribution. However, since I have no 2s, the probability of Player 3 having 5 or more 2s in their 8 digits is roughly 8.3% (assuming random distribution), which is low. I could bid higher, such as 5 3s or 5 7s, but since I only have one 3 and two 7s, I’m not confident in pushing the bid much higher. Given the low likelihood of 5 2s, challenging seems like the better strategic move rather than risking a higher bid that might be challenged against me.
