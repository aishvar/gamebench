Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so any valid bid is acceptable. I have two 9s, one 5, one 7, one 4, and one 0 in my hand. Bidding 1 9s is a reasonable starting bid, as I know there are at least one 9 in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one 9, and the current bid is 1 9s. Increasing the bid to 2 9s seems risky since I only have one 9. Bidding 1 8s is lower than the current bid, so it's invalid. The only logical move is to challenge the current bid, as it's unlikely that there is at least one 9 across all players' hands, considering only one 9 in my hand and the total of 48 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, meaning this is the first bid of the round. I have two 9s in my hand. Given that the previous round involved a successful bid of 1 9s, and I have two, bidding 2 9s is a reasonable and conservative starting bid. It's higher than the implicit previous bid of 0 of any digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have the hand 66589005, which contains one 9. Given that there are 40 total digits and I have one 9, it's plausible that the total count of 9s is at least 2, especially considering the previous round's count was 8 with 48 total digits. However, I should consider making a higher bid or challenging based on the likelihood of the count being higher. Since I have some information about my own hand and the previous round's outcome, I'll analyze the possibilities. Bidding higher seems reasonable. I'll increase the quantity to make a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the likelihood of there being 5 or more 0s across all players. In my hand, I have no 0s. There are 5 active players with 8 digits each, so 40 total digits. The bid has quickly escalated from 2 9s to 5 0s. Looking at my hand (35296544), I have zero 0s. For there to be 5 0s total, the other 4 players would need to have at least 5 0s between them, which is definitely possible (averaging 1.25 0s per player). However, I notice the bidding pattern jumped from 9s to 0s, which might indicate Player 4 has several 0s in their hand. Given that I have no 0s to contribute to the count and the bid is still relatively low (5 out of 40 possible digits), I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. I'll bid 5 1s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. Given the recent history of escalating 9s bids, and the fact that Player 4 bid 5 0s, a bid of 6 0s seems plausible and increases the quantity. It's a reasonable risk to take, as it's a higher bid than the current one and doesn't rely on me having a large number of a specific digit. Alternatively, challenging feels risky as 5 1s is not impossible. Bidding 6 0s gives me a better chance of winning than challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have two 0s in my hand (from 66589005). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Given that there are 40 total digits and the current bid is 6 0s, it's plausible that the total count of 0s is around 6 since I have 2 of them. Increasing the quantity to 7 0s might be too aggressive. However, bidding 6 1s is a reasonable move as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit. I will analyze my hand and the likelihood of other players having higher digits. Since my hand doesn't have many high digits, I should be cautious. Nonetheless, bidding 6 1s seems like a safe and reasonable next step.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. My hand contains two 1s, and with four other players, the average expected count of 1s is around 4 (based on 40 total digits). Bidding higher would require assuming others have more 1s, which is uncertain. Challenging the bid is reasonable as the actual count may be below 6.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 3/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the likelihood of there being 4 or more 0s in all players' hands. Looking at my own hand (35296544), I have zero 0s. There are 32 total digits in play (8 digits for each of the 4 active players). Player 4 has bid 4 0s, which means they're claiming there are at least 4 zeros across all hands. Since I have none, all 4 would need to be in the other three players' hands. While this is possible, it's not highly probable given an even distribution. Each digit (0-9) would appear roughly 3.2 times on average across all hands. With me having zero 0s, the other players would need to have above-average occurrences of 0s for this bid to be true. I could challenge, but it's risky as 4 zeros is within the realm of possibility. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s, two 5s, and one 6. I could bid 4 4s, but that's risky since I only have two. A safer option is to bid 4 5s since I have two 5s in my hand, and I only need two more among the other players, which is reasonable. Alternatively, I could bid 5 0s, forcing the next player to either bid 5 of something higher or 6 of something, which starts getting into riskier territory.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Player 5 bid 4 5s. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 5 5s is a logical next step, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same. Given the history of challenges, and the relatively low total digit count remaining (32), a conservative increase feels safer than a larger jump or switching to a different digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains a 5 and a 6. The current bid is 5 5s. Bidding 5 6s is a valid higher bid since it maintains the same quantity (5) but increases the digit (6 > 5). This leverages my existing digits without overcommitting, while challenging the current bid's likelihood.

Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (35296544), I don't have any 0s. Player 4 has bid 1 0s, which is a very low and safe bid to start the round. Given that there are 24 total digits in play and I have 8 of them with no 0s, there are 16 digits between the other two players. It's quite possible that at least one 0 exists among those 16 digits. Since the current bid is so low, I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. I could bid '1 1s', but I actually have a 5 in my hand twice, so bidding '2 5s' would be a safer play based on what I know for certain.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None. I have two 5s and one 9 in my hand. Given the small number of total digits remaining (16) and the recent history of challenges succeeding with relatively low counts, I will make a conservative but reasonable bid of 2 9s. This increases the digit from the initial bid and is based on the 9s I hold.

Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (35296544), I don't have any 9s. Player 0 has bid 2 9s, which means they're claiming there are at least 2 nines between our hands. Since I have zero 9s, this means Player 0 must have at least 2 nines in their hand for their bid to be valid. This is certainly possible, as they could have 2 or more 9s. I could challenge, but it's a risky move this early. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have three 5s in my hand, which makes '3 5s' a safe bid. I also have two 4s, but bidding on 5s gives me better odds. I could also bid '3 0s' since the digit is higher than 9, but I don't have any 0s in my hand, making it risky. I'll go with '3 5s' as it's both higher than '2 9s' and supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze my hand and the current bid to make a decision. In my hand (35296544), I have one 5. The current bid is 4 5s, made by Player 0. Since there are only 16 total digits in play (8 for each player), and I have 1 of the 5s, that means Player 0 would need to have at least 3 fives in their hand for the bid to be valid. While this is possible, it seems somewhat unlikely that they would have such a concentration of a single digit. Looking at the bidding history, Player 0 started with 2 9s, which might indicate they have some 9s. I think there's a good chance they're bluffing with the 4 5s bid. Given that I only have one 5 in my hand, I'll challenge this bid.
