Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 39154150, I notice I have two 1s, two 5s, and other digits. Since I have to make a bid that is strictly higher than 'None', I can start with a low quantity and a digit I have in my hand. Starting with a bid of 2 1s seems reasonable because it's a low-risk bid, considering I have two 1s in my hand, and it gives me a chance to observe the reactions of other players without committing to a high quantity or a high digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I hold two 2s in my hand, so bidding 2 2s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and very likely given the expected distribution of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s made by Player 1. I have the digits 9, 7, 1, 3, 5, 4, 9, 5 in my hand. I see that there are two 2s bid already and I do not have any 2s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 2s, I'll look at my hand and see if I can make a reasonable bid. I have two 9s and two 5s, and other digits appear once. A reasonable bid could be to bid on a digit I have, increasing the quantity or digit compared to 2 2s. Bidding 3 5s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and uses a digit from my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have the hand 26862753, which contains two 5s. The current bid is 3 5s by Player 2. Given that I have two 5s, it's plausible that there are at least three 5s in total among all players. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I see two 5s in my hand, I can bid 3 6s, increasing the digit. Alternatively, bidding 4 5s is also a valid option as it increases the quantity. I will choose to bid 3 6s as it seems a reasonable next step.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which means there needs to be at least two more 6s among the other five players. Given that the bid has already increased from 3 5s to 3 6s, it's possible that other players have 6s as well. However, bidding higher would require either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have strong evidence to support a higher quantity of any digit, I'll challenge the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None' as it's the start of the round. I have 8 digits in my hand: 26862753. I can see I have two 6s and no other high-frequency digits. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but also consider the information from my hand. Bidding 2 6s is a good start as it reflects the digit I have in my hand and is a relatively low quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. My hand is 26862753, which contains two 2s, one 6s, two 7s, and three other digits. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and the total number of digits (32). I have a total of 2 '2's and 1 '6'. A bid of 3 2s seems reasonable as it is a conservative estimate considering the total count across all players.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 2s' and my hand '39154150', I notice I have one 2. Considering the total digits remaining is 32 and there are 4 players, each with 8 digits, the bid of '3 2s' seems plausible but not extremely high. Since I need to make a strictly higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit seems more reasonable as the quantity of 3 is not very high. Looking at my hand, I see I have two 5s and one 9, but bidding on 5s or 9s directly might be too risky without knowing others' hands. However, I also notice I have multiple 1s and a few other digits. Given the bidding history, players have been somewhat conservative. A safe increase would be to bid on a digit that is reasonably expected to appear a few times across all players. Since '3 2s' is the current bid, and I have to bid higher, bidding '3 3s' or higher seems like a viable strategy, considering the distribution of digits might favor lower numbers due to their higher occurrence in general. However, without clear insight into other players' hands, challenging might be risky. Thus, making a bid that is reasonably higher and based on the distribution of my hand seems wise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 3s in my hand. There are 24 unknown digits among the other players, and the expected number of 3s is only about 2.4. The probability of there being at least 3 is roughly 36%, so 3 3s is unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current state of the game with 24 total digits remaining and no bids yet in this round, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 39154150, I notice I have two 1s, one 3, one 5, one 9, and three other digits. Since I have to make a bid that is strictly higher than 'None', I should consider starting with a low quantity and a digit I have in my hand to minimize risk. Bidding on a digit I have, like 1, seems reasonable because I have two of them, which could contribute to reaching the bid quantity.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s made by Player 0. I have 8 secret digits: 97135495. I see that I have three 1s in my hand. Given that there are two other active players (Player 0 and Player 3) and each has 8 digits, the total number of digits is 24. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. Since I have three 1s and there are two other players, it's possible that they have 1s as well. However, bidding 4 1s seems too risky without knowing the distribution of other players' digits. I should bid higher than 2 1s but not too high. I notice I have no 2s, but I do have other digits. Bidding 3 5s seems reasonable as it's higher than 2 1s and aligns with my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 2. I have the hand 26862753, which contains two 5s and two 6s. Given that I have two 5s, it's plausible that the total count of 5s is at least 3 across all players. However, I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s, bidding 3 6s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit. This bid is consistent with my hand and the information available.

Player 3 bids: 3 6s

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 3 6s and considering my hand 39154150, which does not contain any 6s, I must assess the likelihood of there being at least three 6s among all active players. Since each player has 8 digits and there are 3 active players, the total number of digits in play is 24. The bid of 3 6s seems plausible but not extremely likely given the distribution of digits. However, without concrete evidence or a very strong hand that contradicts this bid, challenging might not be the safest option. Instead, I should consider making a higher bid. Given that I don't have any 6s, bidding on a higher digit or the same digit with a higher quantity is necessary. Since the current bid is on 6s, the next logical step is to either increase the quantity or move to a higher digit. Considering the digits available and aiming to make a reasonable bid, moving to a higher digit seems more feasible. The next higher digit after 6 is 7, but since I don't have any 7s in my hand, I must rely on the probability of their existence across all hands. Given the constraints and aiming for a strategic move, bidding on a higher digit seems like the best approach, but it's crucial to consider the feasibility of such a bid given the total number of digits remaining and the bids made so far.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s made by Player 0. I have the hand 97135495, which contains one 7. Given that there are 3 active players and each has 8 secret digits, there are a total of 24 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. I should assess the likelihood of there being at least 3 7s. Since I only have one 7, and assuming the other players might have a few 7s as well, bidding higher seems risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding 4 5s or higher quantity with a different digit could be an option. But first, let's consider challenging. If I challenge and there are less than 3 7s, I win. If there are 3 or more 7s, I lose. Given my hand and the total digits, challenging seems reasonable if I think the bid is unlikely.

Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity while keeping the same digit, making it a valid higher bid. I will bid 3 5s.

I have two 5s in my hand, and since there are only 16 digits in total for both players, I should consider the possibility of challenging or bidding. Given that my bid must be strictly higher than the current bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 5s, I know there are at least 2 fives.

Given that there are 16 digits in total and I have 2 fives, the remaining 14 digits could potentially have 2 or more fives. However, bidding more than 4 5s seems challenging because it would require at least 5 fives in total, which is plausible but not certain. I can either bid higher or challenge. Since my hand has a 6, I can consider bidding 4 6s, which is a valid higher bid than 4 5s. I will choose to bid 4 6s as it is a reasonable increase in the digit.

Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 16 digits in total for both players, bidding 5 5s seems reasonable as it is higher than 4 6s in quantity. Additionally, since I have one 5 in my hand, and assuming Player 3 has a reasonable distribution, there could be enough 5s to make this bid valid.
