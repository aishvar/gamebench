Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have the digits 9,1,5,0,9,1,7,0 in my hand. Counting them: two 9s, two 1s, two 0s, one 5, and one 7. Since there are 48 digits total, starting with a bid that reflects a digit I hold twice is reasonable. Bidding 2 9s is a solid start since I have two 9s, and 9 is a high digit, making it harder for others to outbid easily.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand, and with 48 total digits across all players, it's plausible the actual count of 9s is less than 2. Challenging this bid could eliminate the bidder if the claim is false.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, which makes bidding on 9s reasonable. Since there is no current bid, I can start with a moderate bid. I will bid 2 9s to set a baseline and leverage my hand strength.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, and the current bid is 2 9s. Given the previous challenge outcome (4 9s in a 6-player game), challenging now risks elimination. To continue playing safely, I bid 3 3s based on having two 3s in my hand, making it plausible there's at least one more 3 among the remaining 40 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (69761381), I have one 3. The current bid claims there are at least three 3s among all players. With 5 active players and 8 digits each (40 total), this is quite plausible. Since I have one 3, and there are 4 other players who could easily have two more 3s between them, challenging would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I see I have one 6 in my hand, so bidding '3 6s' would be a safe play - it keeps the same quantity but uses a higher digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand and the current bid is 3 sixes. By bidding 4 4s I leverage the three I hold and need only one more from the other 32 cards (a ~96% chance), making this a very safe raise that forces the next player to move to quantity 5 or a higher digit at quantity 4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 5 4s would be a reasonable increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have one 1, one 6, one 7, and two 8s. Bidding 2 8s is lower than the current bid and therefore invalid. Bidding 3 6s is also lower. Bidding 2 7s is also lower. Bidding 2 1s is also lower. Therefore, the best option is to increase the quantity of 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s, meaning there are at least five 4s among all 40 digits. I have one 4 in my hand (the digit '4' appears once). Given there are 5 players each with 8 digits, it's plausible that there are at least 5 fours in total. Increasing the quantity to 6 fours would be a reasonable next bid. Since I must bid higher than 5 4s, bidding 6 0s is valid and a good strategic move because zeroes are common and I have two zeroes in my hand, increasing the likelihood of the bid being valid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid of 6 0s seems unlikely given the expected distribution. With only 40 digits remaining, an average of 4 zeros total (including my one 0). Needing five more zeros to reach six is improbable. I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 3 3s is reasonable as it's likely there's at least one more 3 among the remaining 24 digits across the other 3 players' hands. Starting with a bid aligned with my own holdings increases credibility.

Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand (69761381), I have one 3. The current bid of '3 3s' is quite reasonable given there are 32 total digits and I see one 3. I could challenge, but it's likely at least two other 3s exist among the other 24 digits. Instead, I'll make a strategic bid using my hand's strength - I see one 6, and bidding '3 6s' maintains the same quantity but uses a higher digit, making it a valid raise while staying conservative.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. Bidding 4 4s only requires one more 4 among the 24 unknown digits, which has over a 90% chance. This raises the quantity above the current bid of 3 sixes on a digit I hold strongly.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 5 4s would be a reasonable bluff, as it only increases the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have one 6, one 7, one 8, and two 1s. Bidding 4 6s or 4 7s or 4 8s would be valid, but potentially risky. Given the history of challenges, and the relatively low total digit count remaining (32), a slight increase on the current digit seems safest. I will bid 5 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid of 5 4s requires at least five 4s across all 32 digits. Since I have no 4s in my hand (8 digits), all five 4s must be in the remaining 24 digits held by Players 3, 4, and 5. Given that the average expected count for any digit is 3.2 (32/10) and the bid exceeds this, combined with the risk of challenging after Player 5's aggressive raise, the bid seems statistically unlikely. However, Player 4 and Player 5's focus on 4s suggests they might hold several. Still, 5 feels high enough to justify a challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is None, meaning it's the start of the round. I have two 4s, two 6s, one 1, one 7, and one 8. Bidding 1 8s is a conservative first bid. It's low enough that it's plausible and leverages one of my digits. Since it's the first bid, I don't have much information about other players' hands, so a low bid is a safe start.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand (69761381). The current bid of '1 8s' is very low considering there are 24 total digits in play. Since I alone have one 8, it's highly likely there are more 8s among the other players. Based on the game history, Player 5 has shown conservative bidding patterns. I can safely increase this bid, using my knowledge of having one 8 as a foundation.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid of 2 8s is very likely (I hold one 8 and expect ~1.6 more among 16 unknown cards, >80% chance). I have three 4s in my hand, so bidding 3 4s is a safe raise (guaranteed by my hand) and beats 2 8s by increasing quantity.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 4 4s would be a valid increase in quantity. However, given the history of challenges and wins, and the limited number of total digits (24), a higher bid might be more strategically sound. I have two 6s. Bidding 3 6s is a valid bid, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same as the previous bid from Player 3. Bidding 4 4s feels too risky, and challenging seems premature as 3 4s is plausible. Therefore, I will bid 3 6s.

Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (69761381), I have one 6. The current bid of '3 6s' means there need to be at least 3 sixes total among all 24 digits. Given that I only have one 6, and there are only two other players, there would need to be at least 2 more sixes between them to make this bid valid. While possible, the previous bidding patterns and my knowledge of my own hand make this somewhat unlikely. Additionally, Player 5 jumped from 3 4s to 3 6s, which could indicate a bluff. I'll challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is None. I have two 6s and two 4s in my hand. Bidding 4 4s seems like a reasonable starting bid, as it's higher than any previous bid and I have some evidence to support it. I could also bid on 6s, but 4s seems safer given my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I hold three 4s in my hand. The current bid of 4 4s requires at least one 4 in my opponent’s 8 unknown digits. The chance my opponent has zero 4s is (0.9^8) ≈ 0.43, so I win a challenge about 43% of the time. Any higher bid (e.g. 5 4s) has even lower success probability (~19%) and would be challenged.
