Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s and two 5s in my hand. Since there are 48 digits total, starting with a moderate bid like 3 5s is reasonable to establish a baseline without risking too much. It is a safe opening bid given my hand and the total digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains three 5s (40565561). The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 0. Since I personally hold three 5s, the bid is extremely likely to be true, making a challenge unwise. The statistically expected number of any digit across all 48 cards is 4.8. Given my holding, the actual number of 5s is very likely to be 4 or more. Bidding 4 5s is a safe and logical next step, increasing the quantity based directly on my hand's strength in the relevant digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 08063207, which contains no 5s. The current bid is 4 5s by Player 1, up from Player 0's bid of 3 5s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an average of about 4.8 of each digit is expected across all hands. Since I have zero 5s, the likelihood of there being at least 4 5s in the remaining 40 digits is plausible (about 0.8 per player on average). I think it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I have two 0s in my hand, so bidding on 0s could be a reasonable choice. I'll bid 5 0s, increasing the quantity and changing the digit to make a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand of 98952802, I have one 0. With 6 players having 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. For the bid of '5 0s' to be true, there need to be at least 4 more zeros in other players' hands. While possible, this seems somewhat high given that zeros are not particularly common in random distributions. However, since Player 2 made this bid after two players bid on 5s (suggesting they might have multiple 5s rather than 0s), and the bid quantity of 5 is still relatively low compared to the maximum possible, I'll make a safer bid. I have two 2s in my hand, so I'll bid '5 2s', keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s made by Player 3. I have 2 2s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any information about other players' hands, I will increase the digit. Bidding 5 3s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit than 2 and I have a 3 in my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 94993621, which contains two 9s, two 4s, one 6, one 3, one 2, and one 1. The current bid is 5 3s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 5 and bid a higher digit. I have two 4s, which gives me some confidence to bid 5 4s. This is a reasonable incremental bid that does not overcommit, and it is likely that there are at least five 4s among all 48 digits.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding 6 5s is a reasonable increase in quantity and digit, making the bid more believable based on my cards. Increasing the quantity to 6 is a safe move since 5 4s was the previous bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I hold three 5s in my hand (40565561). This means only three more 5s are needed from the remaining 40 digits held by the other 5 players to meet the bid. The statistical expectation is that there are 48/10 = 4.8 (approximately 4 or 5) of each digit in total. Among the other 40 digits, the expected number of 5s is 40/10 = 4. Since only 3 more 5s are needed and 4 are expected, the current bid of 6 5s is very likely correct, making a challenge risky. I should bid higher. Possible bids are 6 6s (or higher digits) or 7 of any digit. I have two 6s, needing 4 more from 40 (expected 4), making 6 6s a safe bid. I also have three 5s, needing 4 more from 40 (expected 4) for a bid of 7 5s. Bidding 7 5s leverages my strongest digit count and increases the quantity, putting more pressure on subsequent players while being statistically well-supported.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 08063207, which contains one 5. The current bid is 7 5s by Player 1. With 6 players and 48 total digits, it's possible that there are 7 or more 5s across all hands, but it's on the higher side since I only have one. The bidding history shows a steady increase in bids for 5s from 3 to 7, suggesting others might have some 5s or are bluffing. I need to bid higher than 7 5s. I could bid 8 5s, but that feels risky given I only have one 5. Alternatively, I can switch to a higher digit with the same or higher quantity. My hand has two 0s, which is decent support for bidding on 0s. Bidding 7 6s or higher seems safer as it changes the digit while keeping the quantity challenging but plausible. I'll bid 7 6s to test the waters without overcommitting on a digit I have little of.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (98952802), I have zero 6s. The current bid claims there are 7 sixes among all 48 digits. Given that I have none, and the bid is relatively high (7), this would require the other 5 players to have an average of 1.4 sixes each to be true. While possible, this seems unlikely given the natural distribution of random digits and the fact that no one else has shown particular confidence in 6s earlier in the bidding. The previous bidding pattern suggests players were more confident about 5s. Based on this analysis, challenging seems like the best option.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 5, one 9, two 2s, two 8s, and two 0s in my hand. Since I'm starting the round and know my own hand, I should make a conservative opening bid.

Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total number of digits is 40. The bid of 3 2s seems plausible but not extremely high. I can see that bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit could be strategic. Since I have one 2 and the bid is 3 2s, bidding 3 3s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit and I have a 3 in my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 94993621, which contains two 9s, two 4s, two 3s, one 6, and one 2. The current bid is 3 3s. Since I have two 3s myself, it is likely that there are at least three 3s among all 40 digits, so challenging would not be ideal. To make a higher bid, I can either bid 3 4s (same quantity, higher digit) or 4 of any digit. I have two 4s and two 9s, so bidding 3 4s is a safe and incremental move.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have two 5s in my hand (digits '5' appear twice). The next valid bid must be higher than 3 4s, so I can bid 3 5s or increase the quantity. Given I have two 5s, bidding 3 5s is plausible and keeps the bid reasonable without overcommitting.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 0. My hand is 40565561, which contains three 5s. Since my hand alone meets the current bid quantity, challenging is guaranteed to lose. I must make a higher bid. The lowest possible higher bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s, making this plausible. Another option is to bid based on my strong suit: I have three 5s. Bidding 4 5s only requires one more 5 among the remaining 32 digits held by the other 4 players. This is statistically very likely. Increasing the quantity to 4 puts more pressure on the next players than simply increasing the digit to 6 while keeping the quantity at 3. Therefore, bidding 4 5s is a safe and strategically sound move.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid of 4 5s seems reasonable given there are 40 total digits and 5 players. Looking at the bidding pattern, players seem confident about 5s, with multiple bids involving them. Since I only have one 5, and need 3 more among other players to make the bid valid, it's a close call but still plausible. I'll bid 4 6s to increase the digit while keeping the same quantity, which I can partially support with my two 6s.

Since I have zero 7s, and with 40 digits in play, it's possible but not certain that there are at least four 7s among the other players' 32 digits. However, since this bid doesn't seem overly aggressive, and I have two 9s (a high digit), I can safely raise to 4 9s, which is a higher bid by digit and leverages my hand strength.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit to 0s with the same quantity would be invalid since 0 < 9. So I must increase the quantity to 5. I have one 5 in my hand and previous bids showed multiple 5s, so bidding 5 0s is a safe next step. This is a valid and reasonable bid given the current bid and my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand (40565561). With 40 total digits among 5 players, the expected number of any digit is 4. The bid requires 4 more 0s from the remaining 32 digits held by other players. The expected number of 0s in those 32 digits is 3.2 (32 * 0.1). So, the bid of 5 0s is slightly above average but plausible, making a challenge risky. I should consider a higher bid. My hand contains three 5s and two 6s. A bid of 5 5s would be very safe (need 2 more 5s, expect 3.2). A bid of 5 6s would also be safe (need 3 more 6s, expect 3.2). However, I can make a stronger bid based on my three 5s. Bidding 6 5s requires 3 more 5s from the other 32 digits, which aligns perfectly with the expectation of 3.2. This is a statistically sound bid that leverages my strong hand in 5s and increases the quantity, putting pressure on the next players.

Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 5. The current bid of 6 5s means there need to be at least 5 more 5s among the other players' hands. With 5 active players total (including me) and 8 digits each, 6 5s is possible but getting quite high. Looking at the bidding pattern, Player 1 has now bid on 5s twice, suggesting they might be bluffing. Given that I only see one 5 in my hand of 8 digits, it seems unlikely there are 5 more 5s in the remaining 32 digits. The probability doesn't favor this bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. In my hand (94993621), I have zero 5s. With 32 digits in play and 8 in my hand, there are 24 unknown digits. The expected number of 5s in 32 random digits is about 3.2, so 5 is already above average. However, it's not implausible for there to be 5 total 5s, especially since the bid only just increased from 4 to 5. Challenging now is risky, as the bid isn't outrageous. The next valid bid is either 6 0s or 5 6s. I have two 9s, two 4s, two 9s, one 3, one 6, two 2s, and one 1, but no 5s or 0s. I do have one 6, so bidding 5 6s is a modest, safe increase, as it only increases the digit and not the quantity, and 6s have not been heavily bid yet.

Increasing the quantity to 6 while keeping the digit at 6s is a valid higher bid and reasonable given the total digits (32) and the likelihood of 6s across all hands.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s made by Player 0. I have two 6s in my hand (40565561). This means the other 24 digits (held by Player 0, Player 4, Player 5) need to contain at least four 6s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 6s in those 24 digits is 2.4. However, Player 5 previously bid 5 6s, and Player 0 raised to 6 6s, suggesting they might collectively hold enough 6s. Furthermore, a previous challenge on 7 6s (with 40 total digits) revealed an actual count of 6, making the current bid of 6 6s (with 32 total digits) seem plausible. Challenging feels risky. Instead, I should consider a higher bid. I hold three 5s. Bidding on 5s leverages my hand strength. The next possible bid for 5s is 7 5s. This requires four more 5s among the other 24 digits. While this is also above the expected average (2.4), there was heavy bidding on 5s previously, including my own successful defense of a 6 5s bid (actual count was 6 among 40 digits). Bidding 7 5s is an aggressive but calculated move based on my strong holding of 5s and the game history.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 5s made by Player 1. I have 2 fives in my hand. Given that there are 3 other active players and each has 8 digits, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. However, with 7 5s already bid and considering the previous bids and challenges, it seems reasonable that there could be a significant number of 5s. However, I also have to consider my own hand and the likelihood. Since I have two 5s and the bid is 7, I need to assess if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. Given that 7 5s is a high bid and there have been previous challenges with mixed outcomes, I should consider if it's more beneficial to challenge or bid higher. My hand does not strongly support bidding much higher on 5s, but I could consider bidding on another digit.

Given that the previous challenge on a similar quantity (7 6s) resulted in only 6 actual 6s with 40 digits, and now there are only 32 digits, the likelihood of there being 8 6s is quite low.

Player 5 Reasoning: It's the start of a new round with 3 players (24 digits total), and I am the first to bid. My hand is 94993621, which contains three 9s, one 6, one 4, one 3, one 2, and one 1. Since there is no current bid, I should open with a conservative but reasonable bid. Bidding 3 9s leverages my strong count of 9s and is not an overreach for the first bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (digit sequence: 0,7,5,0,8,5,3,1), so I know at least one 9 exists. However, I do not have many 9s, and the bid is relatively low. To make a valid higher bid, I must increase the quantity to at least 4 or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit. Since 3 9s is the current bid, the next bid with the same quantity must have a digit higher than 9, which is impossible. Therefore, I must increase the quantity to at least 4. I do not have any 9s to support a higher quantity, but I do have two 5s and two 0s. Bidding 4 0s is the lowest possible next bid (quantity 4, digit 0), which is plausible and maintains pressure. Given the total digits and my hand, this seems a reasonable bid to continue the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand (40565561). This means for the bid to be true, there must be at least three 0s among the remaining 16 digits held by Player 0 and Player 5. The expected number of 0s in those 16 digits is 1.6 (16 * 0.1). Requiring three 0s is significantly above the statistical average. While Player 0 might have several 0s, the probability that there are three or more 0s in the other 16 digits is relatively low (calculated via binomial probability as roughly 21%). Therefore, there is a high probability (~79%) that the bid of 4 0s is higher than the actual count. Challenging is the statistically favorable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I am Player 1, starting the bidding in a heads-up round against Player 5. There are 16 total digits. My hand is 40565561, which contains one 0, one 1, one 4, three 5s, and two 6s. My strongest digit is 5, with three instances. The expected number of any digit in the opponent's 8-digit hand is 0.8. Bidding based on my strongest suit is a good strategy. A bid of '3 5s' would be very safe, as I hold exactly three. However, a bid of '4 5s' is statistically plausible, requiring only one 5 from Player 5's hand (which has an expected value of 0.8 5s). Starting with '4 5s' leverages my strong hand and puts immediate pressure on Player 5 in this two-player endgame.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 94993621, which contains no 5s. Since there are only 16 digits in play and I have zero 5s, all 4 (or more) 5s required by the current bid would have to be in Player 1's hand. The probability that Player 1 has all 4 or more 5s in their 8 digits is extremely low. Therefore, the current bid is very likely to be an overbid, and challenging is the optimal move.
