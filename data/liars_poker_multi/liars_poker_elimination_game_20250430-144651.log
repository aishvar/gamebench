Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the round, so I can bid anything as long as it's valid. I have one 6, one 9, one 0, one 1, and one 4 in my hand. Bidding 1 6s is a conservative start, as it's a digit I have and doesn't reveal much information. It's better than bidding a digit I don't have.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, which already accounts for 2 of the 6s. Given that there are 6 players and 8 digits per player, there are a total of 48 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. Since my hand alone has 2 sixes, and there are 5 other players, it's reasonable to assume there could be more 6s. However, bidding too high risks being challenged and losing. A conservative and strategic bid would be to increase the quantity slightly, considering my own digits and the potential for others to have 6s. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it accounts for my 2 sixes and potentially 1 more six from the remaining 5 players.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Even if all other players also have one 6, the total would only be 6. I believe 3 6s is unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning I can make any initial bid. I have the digits 3, 0, 1, 0, 3, 8, 0, 2 in my hand. I see that I have three 0s, which is a relatively high count for a single digit. Starting with a bid of '3 0s' seems reasonable and a good chance of being valid or setting a strong foundation for the next bids.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have two 0s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid. To increase the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since 3 is the quantity, increasing the digit from 0 to 1 is the next valid bid. I have one '1' in my hand, so bidding 3 1s is a reasonable step.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have the digits 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 0, 5, and 2 in my hand. Notably, I have two 2s and one 0. Since no bids have been made this round, I want to start with a reasonable bid. Bidding 2 2s is a safe starting point because I have two 2s myself, making it likely that there are at least two 2s in total among all players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have three 0s in my hand. Bidding 3 0s is a valid higher bid as it has a higher quantity (3 vs 2). Based on my hand count of 0s and the total number of digits remaining (32 among 4 players), bidding 3 0s is a well-supported and conservative move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 4 0s is a logical next step, as it increases the quantity while staying within a plausible range given the remaining digits. It's also a relatively safe bid since 0s are common. Bidding a higher digit with the same quantity is also an option, but I don't have enough information to confidently do so. Challenging seems premature as 3 0s is not an outrageous bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s made by Player 0. I have 8 secret digits: 30103802. I count 2 zeros in my hand. Given that there are 3 other active players and 32 total digits remaining, the maximum possible zeros across all players is 32. However, with 4 zeros already bid, it's plausible but risky to challenge. I see an opportunity to bid higher with a reasonable chance of success. I will bid 5 1s, increasing both quantity and digit compared to the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s, and I need to make a higher bid. I have only one '1' in my hand, so bidding significantly higher on '1's seems risky. Instead, I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is allowed. The next higher digit after 1 is 2. I have two '2's in my hand, so bidding 5 2s is reasonable and a valid increase over 5 1s. This bid is plausible given my hand and the total digits in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains three 0s. The current bid is 5 2s. Bidding 6 0s is a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity from 5 to 6. Based on my hand, bidding on 0s is a strong option. Needing three additional 0s from the remaining 24 digits across 3 players is statistically plausible (average is 2.4 per digit). Challenging 5 2s is risky as I hold two 2s myself, and it's possible the other players have three or more 2s combined.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 7 0s is possible, but risky as it requires a lot of 0s in other players' hands. Bidding 6 1s is also possible as I have two 1s, but it's a slight increase and might not be enough to deter challenges. Bidding 6 2s would require a lot of 2s in other hands. Considering the history, players have been successful with relatively high bids. I will bid 7 0s, hoping for the best.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s made by Player 0. I have 8 digits in my hand: 30103802. I see that I have three 0s in my hand. Given that there are 3 other active players, the total count of 0s could be higher but we have to consider the maximum possible digits. Since I have to make a bid higher than 7 0s, I should consider both increasing the quantity or the digit. I have 3 zeros, so if the other players have a reasonable distribution, 7 or more 0s seems plausible but I need to be strategic. I also notice I have two 1s and no extremely high digits. A bid of 8 0s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I must either increase the quantity above 8 or keep the quantity at 8 and increase the digit. Since 8 is already a high quantity, bidding 9 0s is a possibility but risky. Alternatively, I can bid 8 1s, which is a higher digit at the same quantity. Considering the previous bids and my hand, bidding 8 1s is a reasonable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s, made by Player 3. There are 32 total digits across 4 players. The expected number of any specific digit is 32 / 10 = 3.2. A bid of 8 is significantly higher than the expected value. I have zero 1s in my hand, meaning all 8 1s would need to be present among the remaining 24 digits held by the other three players. Based on probability, this is unlikely. Bidding higher than 8 1s (either increasing the quantity to 9 or keeping the quantity at 8 and increasing the digit) would require an even larger count of a specific digit, which is also highly improbable based on my hand and the total digits. Therefore, challenging the current bid is the most favorable action.

Player 5 Reasoning: As the first player to bid in this round, I must make a bid. My hand contains three 0s, which is a strong count for a single digit. Bidding '3 0s' is a reasonable starting bid that reflects the strength of my hand for that digit and is a valid bid as the current bid is 'None'.

Player 0 Reasoning: Player 5 bid 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 4 0s is a reasonable increase, as it's a higher quantity than the current bid. Since the previous rounds saw escalating bids on 0s, and I have one myself, it's plausible there are at least four 0s in total. I'm not confident enough to challenge, given the history of successful bids on 0s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '4 0s' made by Player 0. I have 8 secret digits: 30103802. I can see that I have three 0s in my hand. With 24 total digits remaining and two other active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. Given that the current bid is '4 0s', I should consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since I have three 0s and there are two other players, it's possible that the total count of 0s is higher than 4. However, I don't have enough information to be certain. I will make a bid that is higher than '4 0s'. Bidding '5 0s' seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. My hand contains three 0s (82007204). With 3 players and 24 total digits remaining, the average expected count for any digit is 2.4. The bid of 5 0s is high, but the bidding history for 0s in this round (3 0s -> 4 0s -> 5 0s) suggests other players likely hold 0s as well. To challenge 5 0s, the total count of 0s would need to be less than 5. Since I have 3, this means the other two players (Player 0 and Player 1) must have a combined total of 0 or 1 zero. Given Player 0 bid 4 0s after I bid 3 0s, it's highly probable Player 0 has at least one 0, making the scenario where P0+P1 have 0 zeros unlikely. The probability of P0+P1 having 2 or more 0s (making the bid true) seems higher than them having 0 or 1 zero, especially considering the bidding history. Therefore, challenging appears risky. I must make a higher bid. Based on my hand, I have 3 0s and 2 2s. Bidding 6 0s requires a total of 6 0s. Since I have 3, this means Player 0 and Player 1 need a combined total of 3 more 0s from their 16 digits. This is plausible, particularly given the strong bidding on 0s. Bidding 5 2s would require 3 more 2s from P0+P1, which is also plausible but doesn't leverage the information from the 0s bidding war. Bidding 6 0s is a direct escalation of the current bid based on a digit I hold in quantity, and fits the observed game flow.

Bidding 7 0s is possible but still risky, as it requires at least 7 zeros across all three players.

Given that there are only 16 digits in total for both players and we already know the distribution of my hand, I need to assess if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. Since my hand contains 3 zeros, adding Player 5's bid of 3 zeros, we have at least 6 zeros. The maximum possible zeros could be 16, but given my hand and the bid, I should consider if challenging or bidding higher is feasible.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s made by Player 1. There are 16 total digits remaining. I have three 0s in my hand (82007204). This means Player 1's bid implies they have at least 6 - 3 = 3 zeros in their hand of 8 digits. While possible, having 3 or more of a specific digit in a hand of 8 is statistically unlikely for a random distribution. The bid quantity (6) is also relatively high compared to the total digits (16). Given the low probability that Player 1 holds the required number of zeros for their bid to be true, challenging is the most strategic move.
