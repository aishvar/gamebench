Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make an initial bid. My hand contains three 4s and three 8s. Bidding 5 4s is reasonable since I have three 4s, and there are five other players who might hold at least two more 4s in total. This bid is conservative yet allows for escalation based on others' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of 5 4s. In my hand, I have one 4 (in the digit 54801637). With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For the bid of 5 4s to be valid, there need to be at least 5 fours among all players. Since I have 1 four, that means the other 5 players would need to have at least 4 more fours between them, which is quite possible. I could challenge, but it's risky as the bid is reasonable. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 8 in my hand. I could bid 5 5s (same quantity, higher digit) or 6 4s (higher quantity, same digit). Since I have one 5 in my hand, bidding 5 5s seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 5 5s, so a minimal valid raise is 5 6s. To meet this, there must be at least four more 6s among the 40 unknown cards; the expected number is 4 and the probability of ≥4 is around 60%, making this a plausible, low-escalation bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits among opponents, I expect about 3.2 additional zeros, giving around 5.2 zeros total. Opening with 4 zeros is a plausible, conservative bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Since there are 40 digits remaining across 5 players, it's reasonable to assume there are at least 4 0s in total. However, bidding higher on 0s is risky. I have two 6s in my hand, and previously, a bid of 5 6s was successfully challenged. Bidding 5 7s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit, and I have no 7s in my hand, making it harder for others to challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid of 5 7s by Player 4 seems reasonable given: 1) I have one 7, 2) Player 4 likely has at least one 7 to make this bid, 3) we need only 4 more 7s among 3 other players to make this valid, which is quite possible. However, going higher would be risky as we'd need 6 or more 7s total, or switch to 5 8s/9s which I don't have. The previous bidder skipped from 4 0s to 5 7s, showing confidence. Based on my hand and the moderate bid level, I should not challenge.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:1 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. My hand contains two 8s, and with four other players, it's plausible there are at least three more 8s in their hands, totaling five. However, bidding 6 8s increases the quantity while maintaining the digit, which leverages my existing 8s and raises the stakes. This forces the next player to either challenge or bid higher, potentially leading to a more aggressive game. Challenging the current bid is risky since the average expected 8s (40 digits * 0.1) is 4, and the bid of 5 is near that threshold. Bidding 6 8s is a calculated move to control the game flow.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (54801637), I have 0 8s. The current bid is 6 8s made by Player 0. With 5 active players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits in play. For the bid of 6 8s to be valid, the other 4 players would need to have at least 6 8s among them, which means on average 1.5 8s per player. While this is possible, the fact that I have 0 8s makes it less likely. Also, Player 5 previously bid 5 8s, suggesting they might have some 8s. However, Player 0 increasing to 6 8s could be a bluff. Given that I have no 8s and the bid is getting high for a single digit, I think challenging is the best move here.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I'm starting this round, so I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (54801637), I have one 5, one 4, one 8, one 0, one 1, one 6, one 3, and one 7. Since I have one of each of these digits, I could reasonably bid on any of them. However, I should start conservatively since I don't know what other players have. A good starting bid would be to claim 3 of a digit I already have one of. I'll choose 3 7s since 7 is a relatively high digit, which makes it harder for others to outbid me without increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I hold two 9s in my hand, so a bid of 3 9s only requires one more 9 among the 24 unknown cards. The probability of at least one 9 in those is about 1–0.9^24 ≈ 92%, making this a very safe minimal raise (same quantity, higher digit).

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. I have no way to make a higher bid with a digit greater than 9. There are 32 digits remaining, and the previous bid of 3 9s seems reasonable. However, since I have no way to make a higher bid, I should challenge the current bid to try and eliminate Player 2, as they have made the last two bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand; with 16 unknown digits and a roughly uniform distribution I’d expect about 1.6 more 9s, for a total around 3.6. Bidding 3 9s is a safe opening and, as the highest digit at quantity 3, forces opponents to increase the quantity if they continue.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand of '23921957'. The current bid of '3 9s' means there need to be at least 3 nines total across all 24 digits (8 digits × 3 players). Given that I only have one 9, and the bid is relatively low (3 out of a possible 24), it's reasonable to assume there could be 2 more 9s between the other two players. Making a higher bid would be risky since I don't have many 9s myself. However, challenging would be even riskier since the bid is quite conservative. I should make a slightly higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. In my hand, I have one 0 (54801637). The current bid is 4 0s made by Player 5. This means Player 5 is claiming there are at least 4 zeros among all players' hands. Since I have 1 zero, that means Player 2 and Player 5 would need to have at least 3 zeros combined between them. This is certainly possible, but not guaranteed. Given that there are 24 total digits remaining (8 per player × 3 players), and digits are distributed randomly, having 4 or more of any specific digit is plausible but not highly probable. I could challenge, but it's risky. Alternatively, I could make a higher bid. Since I have one 1, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 8 in my hand, I have some flexibility. I'll bid 4 1s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit, which is a valid higher bid. This is reasonable since I already have one 1 in my hand, so I'm only claiming 3 more 1s between the other two players, which is possible.

Player 2 Reasoning: I only have one “1” in my hand, so to make a total of four 1s across 24 cards the other 23 cards would need at least three 1s. The probability of that is under 50%, making the bid of 4 1s unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand (23921957). With only 2 players remaining and 16 total digits, Player 2 would need to have at least 2 more 9s in their hand to make their bid of 3 9s valid. While possible, this is a relatively high bid for 9s given I only have one. Additionally, Player 2 has shown aggressive bidding behavior in previous rounds. Given these factors and that I can see 1/3 of the claimed 9s, challenging seems safer than raising to 4 of something.
