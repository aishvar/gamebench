Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. I can safely bid a slightly higher amount. I will bid 2 1s, as I have one 1 in my hand and it's a reasonable increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 3/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand (23187610). The current bid is 2 1s, which means there need to be at least 2 ones across all players' hands. Since I already have 1 one, we only need 1 more one among the other 5 players, which seems very likely. I could challenge, but it's too risky this early in the game with such a low bid. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, so bidding on 2s could be strategic. I'll bid 3 2s, which is higher than 2 1s both in quantity and digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 3, 5, 9, 0, 6, 0, 9, 5. Counting the 2s I have: none. The current bid is 3 2s, which is already quite high given the total of 48 digits. Since I have no 2s, the actual count is likely below 3, making the current bid suspicious. Challenging now could win me the round if the count is indeed less than 3. Given the low likelihood that there are 3 or more 2s in total, I will challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (23187610), I have one 2, one 3, one 1, one 8, one 7, one 6, one 1, and one 0. Since I have one 2 in my hand, and in the previous round there were at least 5 twos total (as revealed when Player 3 challenged), it's reasonable to assume there are still several 2s in play. I also have a lot of information about my own hand - I know exactly what I have. Starting with a conservative bid like '2 2s' seems reasonable, as there's likely at least one more 2 among the other players' 32 digits (4 players × 8 digits each = 32 digits, plus my 8 digits = 40 total).

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I hold two 6s in my hand and with 32 unknown cards, we expect about 3.2 more 6s, so it’s almost certain there are at least two 6s among all 40 cards. The current bid is 2 2s, so I can safely outbid by raising the digit while keeping the quantity high probability.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (digit '6' appears once). To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. I do not have multiple 6s, so bidding 3 6s might be risky. However, I have two 4s and two 2s in my hand, but those digits are lower than 6, so I cannot bid the same quantity with a higher digit using those. The next possible higher bid after 2 6s is 2 7s or 3 0s. Since I don't have any 7s but have a 0, I can bid 3 0s as it is a higher quantity. Given that 3 0s is plausible and I have one 0, this is a reasonable bid to increase the pressure.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I will increase the digit to 7, and keep the quantity at 3. This seems like a safe bid, as I have two 7s in my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With 24 unknown cards and a 10% chance per card, the probability of seeing at least one more 6 is 1−0.9^24≈92%. Opening with 3 sixes is a safe bid requiring only one extra six.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s, and I must bid higher. My hand contains one 6. Increasing the quantity to 4 with the lowest digit (0) is a valid move and reasonable since 4 occurrences of any digit among 32 digits is plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 8 and estimate about 1.6 more among the 16 unknown digits, giving roughly a 50% chance that there are at least three 8s in total. Challenging 3 7s has slightly negative expected value, so I’ll make the minimal raise to 3 8s to keep pressure.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have zero 0s in my hand, leaving only 16 unknown digits among opponents. The expected number of 0s is about 1.6 and the probability of seeing 4 or more is very low. Player 1’s bid of 4 0s is unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand and only need one more from the opponent for the bid to hold. With 16 total digits the chance of at least one extra 6 is about 57%. Starting at 3 6s is a plausible bid that pressures the opponent and limits their number of same-quantity raises.
