Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start by making a conservative bid based on my hand. My digits are 1, 6, 5, 3, 4, 9, 5, 6. Counting the digits, I have: 1 (once), 3 (once), 4 (once), 5 (twice), 6 (twice), 9 (once). The total counts are: 1s=1, 3s=1, 4s=1, 5s=2, 6s=2, 9s=1. To be safe, I can bid '2 5s' or '2 6s'. Since 2 5s is accurate (I have exactly 2 fives), starting with '2 5s' seems reasonable and not overly aggressive.

Player 1 Reasoning: I hold three 7s in my hand, giving me strong support for that digit. The current bid is only 2 5s, which is very low and likely to be met. By increasing the quantity to 3 and choosing 7s, I legally outbid the previous bid while staying on a digit I’m confident about.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Since I have one 7, I can safely bid 4 7s, increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. With 5 other players, it's possible that there are at least 3 more 7s among them, making the total 4 or more. However, the bid is already at 4, and I don't have strong evidence to challenge. I can make a safe bid by increasing the digit to 8, which I have two of in my hand, suggesting a potential for higher counts among other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits: 1, 6, 3, 9, 0, 3, 6, 7. I see that I have two 6s and two 3s, but no 8s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 8s, I will bid on a digit that I have, aiming for a higher quantity or digit. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable as I have one 7 and it's higher than 4 6s would be but lower digit than 8. However, I can try to increase the quantity or go for a higher digit. I have two 3s and two 6s. Going for 5 6s seems ambitious but could work if others have few 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand, so the total count might be close to the bid. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since bidding 5 7s seems plausible and is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit), I will bid 5 7s.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:5 - gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s, which is quite high but still possible given the total of 48 digits. My hand contains one 5 and one 7, so I can't confidently challenge based on my own hand. The previous bids increased the count of 7s to 4, then 5 6s, and now 5 7s. Since my hand only has one 7, the total count of 7s across all hands is unlikely to be 5 or more, especially with six players. Challenging now has a reasonable chance of success, as it's improbable that there are 5 or more 7s among all players' 48 digits, considering my own hand only has one 7. Therefore, I will challenge the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have digits 5, 8, 3, 3, 8, 7, 7, 2 in my hand, including two 7s and two 8s. Since no bids have been made yet this round, I want to start with a reasonable bid that reflects some likelihood. Bidding 3 7s is a good opening because I hold two 7s and 7s were a strong digit in the previous round with a winning bid of 5 7s. Starting with 3 7s is a moderate bid that others will have to beat.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I already have three 7s in my own hand. By raising the bid to 4 7s, I just need one more 7 among the 32 unseen digits held by the other four players, which is extremely likely. This safely outbids the current 3 7s without taking an unnecessary risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which is already high considering there are only 40 digits in total. The likelihood of there being at least four 8s is uncertain, but since I have two, it's possible. However, increasing the bid to 5 8s seems risky. Alternatively, I could challenge, but with two 8s in my hand, the bid might be valid. A safer move would be to bid a higher digit with the same quantity.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 3. I have a 6 and a 7 in my hand, but no 9s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40 and there are 40 total digits remaining, a bid of 4 9s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. Since my hand doesn't contribute to the count of 9s, I must consider the likelihood of 9s being present. I also have the option to challenge if I think it's unlikely.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is None, and I am the first to bid in this round. I have two 5s and two 8s in my hand. Starting with a conservative bid based on my hand, I'll bid 2 5s to set a low threshold and see how others respond.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. In my hand, I have one 5. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity same and increase the digit. Since bidding 3 5s is higher in quantity, it is a reasonable next bid. Given the low quantity and my holding, I will bid 3 5s.

Player 1 Reasoning: I hold three 7s in my eight-digit hand. Raising the bid to 4 7s increases the quantity from 3 to 4 while selecting a digit I’m strong in. With 24 unknown digits among the other three players, the chance that at least one additional 7 exists is high, making this a relatively safe and legal bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand (68544580). The current bid is 5 7s, which seems high given that in the previous rounds, the actual count was 7 when there were more players. Now with only 4 players (32 digits), it's less likely there are 5 7s. I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is None. I have 4 4s and 2 2s in my hand. To make a valid bid, I need to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any high digits, I'll increase the quantity to 5 and choose a digit that is likely to be present in the remaining players' hands, which is 4.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have one 4 in my hand, which is not many. The previous bids suggest that players have been confident about digits 7 and above, but now the bid is on 4s, which are less frequent in my hand. To make a higher bid, I must bid at least 5 5s or more. I only have one 5, so bidding 5 5s is risky but plausible. Alternatively, bidding 6 0s or higher quantity would be a big jump and likely risky. Since the current bid is reasonable and I have some 5s, I will raise the bid to 5 5s, increasing the digit but keeping quantity the same.

Player 1 Reasoning: Across the 24 total digits, I hold zero 5s. That leaves only 16 unknown digits in the other two hands. Even with a uniform distribution, the expected number of 5s in those 16 digits is about 1.6, and the probability that there are 5 or more is below 2%. Because the current bid requires at least five 5s in total and I know I contribute none, the bid is overwhelmingly likely to be an over-reach. Challenging now gives me roughly a 98% chance to eliminate the bidder.

Player 1 Reasoning: I’m required to make the first bid this round. My hand already contains three 9s, so a bid of 3 9s is guaranteed to be true and cannot lose to an immediate challenge.
