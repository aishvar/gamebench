Player 0 Reasoning: Since it's my turn to start bidding and there are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits, I should consider the distribution of digits in my own hand and make an educated guess about the overall distribution. My hand is 28853086, which contains two 8s, two 3s, and one each of 2, 5, 0, and 6. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but not too low. Given that I have two 8s, it's plausible that there are more 8s across other hands. Bidding 8 8s seems like a reasonable starting point as it reflects a quantity that is somewhat likely given my hand and the total number of digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand. With 40 other digits remaining the expected number of 8s is about 4 (SD ~1.9), so the chance of there being at least eight 8s is very low. I should challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Starting with 2 9s is a safe opening bid—guaranteed by my hand—and using the highest digit forces others to increase the quantity to over 2 if they want to outbid me.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 4. The bid of 2 9s is low. I have one 9 in my hand (82737794), meaning only one more 9 is needed among the other 32 digits for the bid to be true. Challenging seems risky as the bid is likely correct. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains three 7s. Bidding based on my strong suit is a good strategy. The expected number of 7s is 4. Bidding 4 7s is a plausible increase, requiring only one more 7 from the remaining 32 digits (where the expected number is 3.2). This leverages my hand and puts pressure on the next player.

Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s. With 5 players having 8 digits each (40 total), and Player 2 bidding 4 7s, this seems reasonable. Since I already account for half of the claimed quantity, it's likely other players have at least two more 7s between them. Rather than challenge, I should increase the bid. Looking at my hand, I have three 3s, which gives me confidence to bid 4 3s - keeping the same quantity but using a different digit I'm sure about.

Player 4 Reasoning: Player 3 bid 4 8s. I have a single 8 in my hand. Since there are 40 total digits remaining and 3 other players, it's plausible that there are 4 8s in total. However, I can attempt to bluff and bid higher using a digit I don't have, hoping others will fold or challenge. Bidding 5 6s increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a valid bid. If challenged, I might win if the actual count of 6s is 5 or more, or I might lose and be eliminated.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 24731664, containing three 6s. The current bid is 5 6s. Since there are 40 digits in play and I have three of the 6s, that leaves 37 digits among the other four players. For the current bid to be true, there must be at least two more 6s among those 37 digits. This is plausible, as the expected number of any digit in 37 random digits is about 3.7. Therefore, the bid is reasonable and not obviously false, so challenging is risky. I should make a higher bid. I do not have many 7s or 8s, but I can safely increase the digit to 7 (since 5 7s is a valid next bid), as I have one 7. This keeps my bid conservative and does not overcommit.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. To reach 5 9s I need only three more among the 32 unknown digits. The probability of at least three 9s in 32 cards is about 62%, which is higher than the ~40% chance the current bid of 5 7s is valid. Raising to 5 9s puts pressure on opponents with a reasonably strong hand support.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s made by Player 1. I hold one 9 (in 82737794). This means 4 more 9s are needed from the remaining 32 digits held by the other 4 players. The expected number of 9s in those 32 digits is 3.2 (32/10). While 5 total 9s is plausible, Player 1's jump from an initial bid of 2 9s to 5 9s is notable and could be a bluff. Instead of challenging, I should consider my own hand. I hold three 7s, which is a strong holding. Player 5 recently bid 5 7s, suggesting they likely hold at least two 7s. If Player 5 holds >=2 sevens and I hold 3, there are already >=5 sevens accounted for between just us two. Bidding 6 7s only requires one additional 7 among the remaining 24 digits (excluding mine and Player 5's assumed two), which is statistically very likely. Therefore, bidding 6 7s is a strong move based on my hand and the recent bidding history.

Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand, I have zero 7s. The current bid claims there are 6 7s total. Given the bid history, Player 2 has increased the quantity from 5 to 6 7s, despite Player 5's earlier bid of 5 7s already seeming high. With 40 total digits and 5 players, the average per digit would be 4. Since I have zero 7s and 6 7s would require a very uneven distribution among the remaining players, this bid seems unlikely to be true.

Player 2 Reasoning: I am Player 2 and it's my turn to start the bidding. There are 4 active players and 32 total digits. My hand is 82737794, which contains three 7s. This is a strong holding for a single digit. The expected number of any digit across all 32 digits is 3.2. Since I already have three 7s, it's highly probable there's at least one more 7 among the other 24 hidden digits (3 players * 8 digits). The expected number of 7s among the other 24 digits is 2.4. Therefore, bidding '4 7s' is a safe and strong opening bid, leveraging my hand's strength while making a statistically likely claim.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Given that there are 32 digits remaining across 4 players, with 8 digits each, it's plausible that there could be at least 4 7s. However, bidding higher on 7s is risky. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 5 6s is a reasonable move, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This bid is higher than the current bid (4 7s) because it has a higher digit (6 vs 7).

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 24731664, which contains two 6s. The current bid is 5 6s, meaning at least 5 of the 32 digits across all hands are 6s. I only have 2, so there must be at least 3 more among the 24 digits held by the other three players. The probability that there are at least 5 total 6s is moderate, but not certain. However, challenging at 5 6s is risky since it's plausible. Instead, I will make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit to 7, since I have one 7 in my hand, making '5 7s' the next valid bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: As the first bidder this round, I should make a safe opening bid based on my hand. My hand is 24731664, which contains two 6s, two 4s, one 2, one 7, one 3, and one 1. Since there are 24 digits in play, and each digit should appear on average about 2.4 times, bidding 3 of a digit I have at least two of is a safe and credible start. I will bid 3 6s, since I have two 6s myself.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand (82737794). For the bid to be false, the other two players (Player 4 and Player 5) must have fewer than three 6s combined in their 16 digits. This is plausible, but challenging feels risky as Player 5 likely has at least one 6 to make the bid. I have three 7s in my hand. Bidding 4 7s is a valid higher bid. This bid requires only one more 7 among the 16 digits held by the other two players. Given that the average count per digit is 2.4 (24 total digits / 10 possible digits), finding at least one 7 among the remaining 16 digits is highly probable. Previous rounds also showed a high count of 7s (6 existed among 40 digits, and 6 existed among 32 digits in the last two rounds involving challenges on 7s). While some 7s might have belonged to eliminated players, bidding 4 7s leverages my strong hand and seems statistically very safe compared to challenging 3 6s.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 24731664, which contains three 6s. The current bid is 5 6s. With only three players and 24 digits in play, a bid of 5 6s is plausible but already somewhat aggressive. Since I hold three of the 6s myself, it's possible the other two players collectively have at least two more 6s, but it's not guaranteed. However, challenging now is risky because the bid is not outrageous and could easily be met. The safest move is to make a higher bid. The most conservative valid raise is 5 7s, but I have no 7s, making it risky. Instead, I'll raise the quantity to 6 and stick with 6s, since I have three myself, making it likely there are at least six among all hands.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s made by Player 5. I have zero 6s in my hand (82737794). For the bid to be true, the other two players (Player 4 and Player 5) must have at least six 6s combined in their 16 digits. Player 4 bid 5 6s earlier this round, and Player 5 raised it to 6 6s after also starting the round with a bid of 3 6s. This strong bidding sequence on 6s suggests it's plausible they collectively hold six 6s, making a challenge risky. My hand contains three 7s. Bidding 6 7s is the next available bid. This requires a total of six 7s across all 24 digits. I hold 3, meaning the other 16 digits need to contain at least 3 more 7s. This is statistically plausible (expected value in 16 digits is 1.6, needing 3 is reasonable). I previously bid 4 7s this round, and 7s have appeared frequently in previous rounds (Player 5 won a challenge on 5 7s last round, I won on 6 7s the round before). Therefore, bidding 6 7s is a credible move based on my hand and the game history, and safer than challenging the 6 6s bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 5. I have zero 6s in my hand (82737794). For the bid to be true, Player 5 must have at least three 6s in their 8-digit hand. This is possible, but not guaranteed, making a challenge a risky option. My hand contains three 7s. Bidding on 7s seems strong. The next possible bid is 3 7s. Since I hold three 7s myself, this bid is almost certainly true (total digits 16). However, a slightly more aggressive bid of 4 7s is also plausible. I have three 7s, so I only need Player 5 to have one 7 among their 8 digits. The probability of Player 5 having at least one 7 is reasonably high (1 - (9/10)^8 ≈ 57%). In a heads-up situation, putting pressure on the opponent is often advantageous. Bidding 4 7s leverages my strong suit and forces Player 5 into a potentially difficult decision, making it a better strategic move than the overly safe 3 7s or the risky challenge.

However, since I have three 6s, I can safely raise to 4 6s, which is a strictly higher bid (same quantity, lower digit is not allowed, so I must increase the quantity for 6s).

This is possible, but unlikely, as 3 or more of a specific digit in a random 8-digit hand is not common. Given the odds and the fact that previous high bids on 7s have often been challenged, I will challenge.
