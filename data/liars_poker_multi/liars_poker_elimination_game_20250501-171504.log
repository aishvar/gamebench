Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since it's the first bid, I can bid anything as long as it's a valid bid. I have two 8s, one 9, and two 4s in my hand. Bidding 1 9s seems reasonable as a starting bid, as I have a 9 in my hand and it's a low quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I must raise the bid above 1 9s. I’m holding three 7s (27787298), so I already satisfy a bid of 3 7s by myself. That makes the bid very safe for me if someone challenges, while only modestly increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 25479756, which contains two 7s. The current bid is 3 7s by Player 1. Since I have two 7s myself, it's plausible that there is at least one more 7 among the other 40 digits across the remaining players. The average expected count for any digit across 48 digits is about 4.8, so 3 7s is a reasonable bid. I don't want to challenge this bid as it seems likely to hold. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I can increase the quantity to 4 and stay with 7s, as my two 7s support this bid to some extent. Bidding 4 7s feels safer than switching to a higher digit with a lower quantity, given my hand's strength in 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid of 4 7s is plausible— I hold one 7 and expect about 4 more among the 40 unseen cards (~76% chance). I have two 4s and expect another ~4 in the unseen cards, so bidding 5 4s (strictly increasing the quantity) gives me roughly a 76% chance of being correct and is a valid raise.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:0 - o3-2025-04-16) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I hold three 3s (0,6,7,3,6,4,3,3). By raising the quantity to 6 and choosing 3s, I only need at least three more 3s among the 40 unknown digits. The expected number of 3s in those 40 digits is 4, giving roughly a 78% chance the true count is 6 or more. This is a solid, statistically favorable improvement over the current bid of 5 4s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. Bidding 6 8s seems reasonable since the expected total number of 8s across all players is approximately 7, making this bid highly likely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 7 8s is a reasonable increase, as it maintains the digit and increases the quantity. While risky, it's a logical progression given my hand and the previous bids. Bidding a higher digit with a lower quantity would be less informed without knowing the other players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:5 - o3-2025-04-16) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I see 2 eights in my own hand. To satisfy Player 0's bid of 7 8s, there must be at least 5 more eights among the 40 unknown digits. With a roughly uniform distribution, the expected number of eights in those 40 digits is 4, and the probability of there being 5 or more is a bit under 40%. That means the current bid is more likely to be wrong than right (≈63% chance it fails). Raising the bid would give me an even higher personal risk of being challenged and eliminated. Challenging now offers the best odds of success.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I need to make the first bid. I have two 8s in my hand. Given the previous round saw a successful bid of 7 8s, and a count of 8, bidding 1 9s seems a safe and reasonable starting point. It's a low quantity, but a different digit, and doesn't rely heavily on other players having the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s by Player 0, which is a very low bid and likely safe given that there are 40 total digits across 5 players. In my hand, I have no 9s, but I do have two 5s, two 7s, and other digits. Since the bid is low, I can safely raise it. I will bid 2 9s to keep the digit high and test the waters, as it's still a conservative increase given the total number of digits. This bid is higher than 1 9s and allows me to stay in the game without taking too much risk early on.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9, but it’s very likely there’s another among the 32 unknown cards. Instead of challenging, I should increase the bid. I hold two 4s, and the expected count of 4s in the other hands is about 3.2, so it’s highly probable there is at least one more 4. Bidding 3 4s leverages my pair and is a safe, valid increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. Challenging makes little sense because three 4s among 40 digits is very likely. I have three 3s in my own hand (06736433), so if I raise the bid to 4 3s I only need one additional 3 among the 32 unknown digits. The probability of that is extremely high, making the bid safe while still increasing the quantity and therefore outbidding Player 3.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 3s. Bidding 4 8s is valid as it's the same quantity but a higher digit. Given my three 8s, it's plausible that the total count of 8s across all players (including mine) reaches four, especially considering the average distribution of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 5 8s is a logical increase, and I have some evidence to support it. Bidding higher in quantity with a different digit is risky as I don't have many of those digits. Challenging seems premature as 4 8s is plausible given 5 players with 8 digits each.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:3 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 25479756, which contains no 8s. The current bid is 5 8s by Player 0. With 40 total digits across 5 players, an average of 4 of each digit is expected if distributed evenly. Since I have no 8s, it's possible that the other 4 players have the 5 8s among their 32 digits, but it feels slightly optimistic given the distribution. However, bidding history shows Player 5 bid 4 8s and Player 0 raised to 5 8s, suggesting confidence in 8s. I could challenge, but the risk of losing is significant if they are correct. Instead, I'll make a safer bid of 6 3s, as I have one 5 in my hand, but switching digits and increasing quantity feels more strategic. I don't have strong confidence in 3s, but it's a reasonable escalation.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have zero 3s in my hand. With 40 total digits, the expected number of 3s is about 4, and the probability of at least 6 is under 20%. The current bid of 6 3s is very unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. With 24 unknown digits among the other players, it’s very likely there’s at least one more 4. Bidding 3 4s sets a solid baseline while still having a high probability of being correct.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I hold three 3s in my hand. By raising to 4 3s I increase the quantity while choosing a digit I’m already strong in. I only need one more 3 among the 24 unseen digits, and with an expected 2–3 such 3s out there the probability this bid is true is well over 90%. This makes the bid a safe and legal improvement over the current 3 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid than 4 3s (same quantity, higher digit). This leverages my strong 8s count and applies pressure, as others may not have enough to raise further. Challenging 4 3s carries elimination risk if the bid is true, but my hand suggests 8s are a safer play.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 5 8s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have the cards to potentially support it. Alternatively, challenging seems risky as Player 5 could have several 8s. Given the remaining digits (32), 4 8s is plausible, and 5 8s is also within the realm of possibility. I will bid 5 8s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I only have one 8 in my hand. There are 24 unknown digits among the other three players, and to reach at least five 8s total they’d need four more. The probability of four or more 8s in 24 random digits is quite low, and even accounting for Player 0’s possible 8s, the bid of five 8s is unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable starting bid, as it's based on the digits I hold and is likely to be a valid bid. It's a conservative approach given the limited number of players remaining and the potential for bluffs.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: In the prior round with four players the revealed total of 8s was 6, and I had none of them. Only Player 3 has been eliminated since then, so the two remaining opponents probably still hold at least four 8s among their 16 digits. Challenging 3 8s would therefore be risky. Instead, I will safely raise the quantity by one, moving to 4 8s, which is very plausible given the earlier information.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand, making the total count of 8s likely at least four (including Player 4's bid of 4 8s). Bidding 5 8s leverages my strong position in 8s and assumes at least one additional 8 exists in other players' hands. This bid escalates the stakes while maintaining credibility based on my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. While I could bid higher on another digit, increasing the 8s bid seems more strategic given the recent history. Bidding 6 8s is the next logical step, and I have the cards to potentially support it. It's a reasonable increase without being overly aggressive.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand. For Player 0’s bid of 6 8s to be true, the other two hands (16 unknown digits) would need to contain all six or more 8s. With a 1/10 chance per digit, the probability of seeing 6 or more 8s in 16 digits is well under 1%. That makes the current bid overwhelmingly unlikely to be correct, so challenging is the safest move.

Player 4 Reasoning: I hold three 3s in my own hand, so a bid of 3 3s is guaranteed true for me. From my opponent’s viewpoint, the chance that there are at least three 3s in 16 random digits is low (~20%), so they may challenge and lose. This makes 3 3s a safe yet pressuring opening bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand, making 8s a strong candidate for a higher bid. The current bid of 3 3s can be outbid by either increasing the quantity (e.g., 4 8s) or raising the digit (e.g., 3 4s). Given my hand's composition, bidding 4 8s leverages my existing 8s and forces Player 4 to respond, potentially avoiding a risky challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: I hold zero 8s. To satisfy the bid of 4 8s, the entire set would have to be in Player 5’s eight digits. With each digit having about a 10% chance of being an 8, the probability that they have four or more 8s is roughly 0.5%. That is far lower than the break-even point, and recent rounds never showed such a dense concentration of 8s. Challenging is the strongest move.
