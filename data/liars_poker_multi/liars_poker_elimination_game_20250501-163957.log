Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I want to make an opening bid that is both safe and gives me room to maneuver. My hand contains three 2s, two 6s, one 3, one 7, and one 1. Since I have three 2s, it's statistically likely that there are more 2s among the 48 digits. A conservative opening bid is '3 2s', reflecting my strong holding in 2s and not overcommitting.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have the hand 70863138, which contains one 3. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 3, and there are 5 other players, it's plausible that there are at least 3 threes in total. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 3 4s seems reasonable as it increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 4s and my hand containing 26795790, I notice I have one 4 and one 5, but no 6s or higher. Since the current bid is already at 4 4s, making a higher bid requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. With only one 5 in my hand, bidding on 5s might be risky without knowing the distribution of other players' hands. However, considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and assuming a somewhat even distribution, it's plausible that there could be enough 5s to support a bid. Given the information and aiming to make a strategic move, increasing the digit seems more feasible than the quantity, as bidding a higher quantity (5 or more) of any digit might be too speculative without more information.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s. Bidding 5 4s increases the quantity (5 > 4) and leverages my existing 4s, making it a valid and strategic higher bid. Since the average count for any digit is ~4.8, 5 4s is plausible and forces opponents to either bid higher or challenge with uncertainty.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have no 4s in my hand, making it risky to challenge now, as it's possible for the other five players to collectively have five or more 4s. My hand is strongest in 2s (three of them) and 6s (two of them). Raising the bid to 5 6s leverages my own hand strength and is a reasonable next step, since 6s are less likely to have been bid up already. This keeps the pressure on others without overcommitting.

Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first to bid this round. My hand is 66273221, which contains two 2s, two 6s, two 3s, one 7, and one 1. With 40 digits in play and 5 players, opening with a bid that reflects the digits I have the most of is optimal. Bidding 2 2s or 2 6s is too conservative and may be easily overbid. Bidding 3 2s is a reasonable opening, as I hold two myself and it's likely at least one more exists among the remaining 32 digits.

Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 4s and my hand containing 26795790, I notice I have one 4 and one 5, and one 9. Since the current bid is 3 4s, to make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Considering the total digits remaining and the distribution, bidding on a higher digit seems more reasonable. With one 5 in my hand and considering the potential distribution of other players' hands, bidding on 5s could be a good strategy. Thus, I will bid on 3 5s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same as the current bid, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. My hand contains one 5 and a 6. Bidding 3 6s maintains the same quantity but increases the digit, following the pattern of prior bids (3 2s → 3 3s → 3 4s → 3 5s). Since I have a 6, this bid is defensible. Challenging 3 5s is risky because I have one 5, and with 40 total digits, reaching 3 5s is plausible across 5 players.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, and with 40 total digits among 5 players, it's likely there are more 6s in play. Since I have a strong holding in 2s as well (three in my hand), raising to 4 2s is a safe and valid higher bid, increasing the quantity while switching to a digit where I have good coverage.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have the hand 70863138, which contains one 3 and no 2s or higher digits relevant to the current bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll make a conservative bid. Bidding 4 3s is a valid higher bid because it increases the digit. This seems reasonable given the current state.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have a 4 in my hand and the current bid is 4 3s. To make a valid bid, I must either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 4, my best option is to bid 4 4s, increasing the digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 4s' and my hand '26795790', I notice I have one 4, which might suggest that bidding higher on 4s could be risky. However, considering the total digits remaining and the distribution, it's plausible that there could be more 4s. Since I need to make a strictly higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or the digit. Given my hand doesn't offer a clear advantage in higher digits (like 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s, 9s) and considering the risk of challenging without a strong basis, I opt to increase the quantity of a digit that seems feasible. Noticing my hand has two 7s and considering the bids so far, moving to a higher digit seems more strategic than increasing the quantity of 4s, which might be risky given the current bid. Therefore, bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity as the last bid seems like a balanced move, taking into account the need to bid higher and the information from my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. My hand contains one 5 and one 6. Bidding 4 6s increases the digit while keeping the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Given the total digits remaining (40), 4 6s is plausible since there are 5 players, each potentially holding up to one 6. Challenging the current bid carries risk as the actual count of 5s could be 4 or more, especially if other players hold additional 5s. A bid on 6s leverages my existing 6 and opens a new digit with reasonable probability.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and there are 5 players with 8 digits each, totaling 40 digits. The current bid is 4 6s. It's likely there are more than 4 6s in total, and since I have two, I'm comfortable increasing the bid. The next valid bid is 4 7s or 5 2s. Bidding 4 7s is riskier since I have no 7s, but bidding 5 2s is safer as I have two 2s. I'll bid 5 2s to increase the quantity and choose a digit I hold.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have one 2 in my hand (70863138). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 40 digits in total and 5 players remaining, a bid of 5 2s implies that there are at least 5 twos distributed among all players. I can see one 2 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either bid a higher quantity (6 or more) with the same digit or bid 5 with a higher digit. Bidding 5 3s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit and I have verified my hand for the digit 3.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have 2 3s in my hand. I can safely bid 5 4s, increasing the digit, as my hand does not contain any 4s, and I'm not risking elimination by challenging the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 5 4s and considering the history of bids, it seems that players have been increasing their bids in a somewhat conservative manner. Looking at my hand, 26795790, I have one 5 and one 9, but no 4s or 6s that were recently bid. Since the current bid is 5 4s, to make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Given that I don't have any 4s, bidding on 4s is risky. However, I notice that the digit 5 has been bid previously, and since I have a 5, it might be a safer bet to increase the quantity of a higher digit than 4, considering the total digits remaining and the distribution. But since I only have one 5 and no 6s or higher in my hand, making a bid on a higher digit than 4 with a higher quantity than 5 seems risky without more information. Thus, challenging the current bid might be a safer option if I believe the actual count of 4s is less than 5, given the total number of digits remaining and the fact that no player has bid higher than 5 on any digit yet. However, without direct evidence or a strong reason to doubt the bid of 5 4s based solely on my hand and the game's progression, making a strategic bid that is higher and reasonable based on the game's flow is preferable. Given the pattern of increasing bids and the aim to stay in the game, a cautious increase in either quantity or digit is necessary. Considering the bids have not exceeded 5 in quantity and have steadily increased in digit or quantity, and knowing the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40, a bid that increases the quantity or the digit from the current 5 4s, while being mindful of the total digits and previous bids, seems like the best approach. Since I don't have enough information to safely challenge and considering the need to increase the bid, I will choose to increase the digit, as increasing the quantity to 6 might be too risky without knowing the distribution of digits among other players.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have one 5 in my hand, so at least four more 5s would be needed across the remaining 32 digits. The expected number of 5s in those digits is 3.2, making the bid plausible but not certain. Bidding 5 6s shifts the focus to a digit I also hold (one 6 in my hand), requiring four more 6s. This maintains pressure while leveraging my existing digit, and challenges others to either raise the bid or challenge. It's a strategic escalation with similar probabilistic odds but shifts the narrative.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 6s. With 40 digits in play and three 6s myself, it's very plausible that there are at least six or more 6s among all hands.

Given that there are 40 digits in total and I have one 6, it's possible that the total count of 6s is around or more than 6, considering the bids have been escalating. However, bidding higher than 6 6s requires a good reason. I can either bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since my hand doesn't give me strong confidence in a much higher count of 6s, I'll consider bidding with a higher digit. Bidding 6 7s seems reasonable as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 7 7s and my hand containing 26795790, I notice that I have one 7. Considering the total digits remaining are 40 and there are 5 players, each with 8 digits, the maximum number of any single digit across all players is 40. Since the current bid is 7 7s, which seems reasonable given the history of bids, I must decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Making a higher bid requires either increasing the quantity or bidding on a higher digit. Given that 7 is a high digit and the quantity is already at 7, the next logical step would be to either increase the quantity to 8 for the digit 7, which might be risky given the total number of digits, or to bid on a higher digit, which would be 8 or 9. However, since my hand does not contain any 8s or 9s, and given the risk of challenging a potentially valid bid, I should consider the likelihood of the bid being true. With one 7 in my hand, I have to consider the distribution of the remaining digits across other players. Challenging the bid could be beneficial if I believe the actual count of 7s is less than 7, but given the progression of bids and the fact that no one has challenged yet, it might indicate that higher bids are somewhat grounded in reality. Therefore, my best course of action, considering I want to stay in the game and the potential risk of challenging, is to make a strategic bid that acknowledges the current state while also considering the potential distribution of digits.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 66273221, so I have two 2s, two 6s, two 3s, one 7, and one 1. The current bid is 4 4s. Since I have zero 4s, I cannot directly support the bid, but with 32 total digits among 4 players, it's possible there are 4 or more 4s distributed among the other three players. Challenging now is risky because 4 of a digit is not an unusually high bid at this stage. The optimal move is to raise the bid to a digit I have strong representation in. I have two 2s and two 3s, but two 6s is also strong. I will bid 4 6s, which is a higher digit at the same quantity, and is backed by my hand.

Since I have 0 7s and the bid requires at least 5 total, it is statistically unlikely the actual count meets this. Challenging is the optimal move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: As the first bidder in the round, I need to establish a bid based on my hand. I have three 4s in my hand, making 3 4s a safe and reasonable starting bid. This bid is supported by my own digits and follows the typical progression of bids in previous rounds.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s and three 2s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 4s. Making a higher bid is safe, and bidding 3 6s leverages my strong holding in 6s. This is a minimal increment and keeps the pressure on the next player without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 0. My hand is 70863138, which contains two 6s and one 3. Given that there are 24 total digits and I have 8 of them, I can analyze the likelihood of the bid being correct. The bid of 3 6s implies there are at least three 6s in total. I have two 6s, so the remaining players must have at least one 6. It's plausible that Player 0 and Player 5 together have at least one 6. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have information about my own hand, I know I have two 6s and one 3, and no higher digits in significant amounts. I can bid 3 7s, increasing the digit. Alternatively, bidding 4 6s is also a valid option as it increases the quantity. Given the information, bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it's a conservative increase based on my hand strength and the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. With three players and 24 total digits, the likelihood of four 6s is low unless others have multiple 6s. Given the previous successful challenge and the conservative play style, challenging this bid is a calculated risk. If the actual count is less than four, the bidder (Player 2) is eliminated.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The game has just started with two active players, and there are 16 digits in total. I am Player 2 and have the hand 70863138. I can see that I have one 0, one 1, one 3, two 6s, one 7, and two 8s. Since there's no current bid, I need to make the first bid. A reasonable starting point is to bid on a digit that I have in my hand. I have two 6s and two 8s, so bidding on either 6s or 8s seems reasonable. I'll start with a conservative bid of 3 8s, as it's a digit I have in my hand and it's a relatively safe starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand (66273221), so for Player 2's bid of 3 8s to be valid, all three 8s must be in their hand. The probability of Player 2 having three or more 8s in their 8 digits is low. Given the history, Player 2 has previously bid on 6s and 7s, but not 8s, and with only 16 digits in play, this is a risky bid. Therefore, I should challenge.
