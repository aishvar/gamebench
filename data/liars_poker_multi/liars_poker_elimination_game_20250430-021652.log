Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there's no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 27721915, which contains two 1s, two 2s, one 7, one 9, and one 5. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I see. Since there are 6 players and 48 digits in total, I should start with a conservative bid. I notice I have two 2s, so bidding on 2s seems reasonable. A bid of 3 2s is a cautious start, considering the total count might be higher than what I see in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '2' in my hand. The current bid is '3 2s' made by Player 0. With 5 other players, it's possible that at least two more '2s' are among them, making the bid plausible. However, I don't have strong evidence to challenge. I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit, so I'll bid '3 5s' since I have two '5s' in my hand, which is a safe increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. I can make a valid higher bid by increasing the quantity or digit. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable, increasing the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which supports Player 2's bid of '3 6s'. Since I can see two 6s, it's quite likely there's at least one more 6 among the other 40 digits I can't see. Given this knowledge, I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. With two 6s confirmed in my hand, bidding '4 6s' would be risky. Instead, I'll bid '3 7s' - this is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and seems reasonable given the bidding pattern so far.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 3 7s and I need to make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since my hand contains 12580480, I have no 7s or higher digits to base my bid on. However, considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 players, the maximum any single digit can appear is 48 (if all players had the same digit, which is highly unlikely). Given the progression of bids, it seems players are bidding on higher digits without necessarily having them in their hands. I have two 0s and other lower digits, but no high digits like 7 or above. The safest move, considering I don't have high digits and the bid is already at 3 7s, would be to challenge the current bid, as bidding higher without a strong basis could lead to a loss. The current bid of 3 7s might be a bluff or an overestimation, especially since no player has shown to have a significant number of high digits in their bids so far.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Since I'm starting the round and there are 40 total digits with 5 players, bidding 3 3s is a conservative opening bid. This leaves room for future increases while being likely true based on my hand alone covering 2/3 of the claimed quantity.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits: 3, 0, 6, 4, 0, 5, 4, 8. I can see that I have one 3 in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are 40 digits in total. The bid of 3 3s seems plausible but not extremely high. I can increase the quantity or the digit to make a higher bid. Since I have two 0s, bidding on a higher digit seems reasonable. I will bid 3 4s, as it is a higher digit than 3 and I have two 4s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. My hand is 27721915, which contains one 2, two 7s, one 1, one 9, and one 5. I can see that I have no 4s. Considering there are 5 active players with 8 digits each, the total count of 4s across all hands is likely to be around 4-6 if evenly distributed. However, I should be cautious and not overbid. A reasonable next bid could be to increase the digit. I can bid 3 5s since I have one 5 in my hand, making it plausible that there are at least three 5s in total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. Given that there are 4 other players with 8 digits each, it's possible that there are at least 3 5s in total. However, the bid is already at the lower end of plausibility. To stay in the game, I can make a safe bid by increasing the digit to 6, which I also have one of in my hand. This keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have 3 sixes in my hand. The current bid of 3 6s by Player 1 seems reasonable, but I can try to increase the digit to 7, as I have a 7 in my hand. I don't have enough information to make a higher quantity bid, so I'll aim to increase the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, which means Player 2's bid of '3 7s' requires only one more 7 among the other four players (32 remaining digits) to be valid. This seems quite reasonable. Given my hand has two 7s, I can confidently bid '3 8s' - even if I don't have any 8s, there's a good chance of finding three 8s among the other 32 digits held by other players. This keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 3. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total number of digits is 40. The bid of 3 8s seems somewhat reasonable but not extremely high. However, I have to consider if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more beneficial. Since my goal is to either make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should assess the likelihood of the bid being true. With 40 total digits, 3 8s is possible but not guaranteed. I will make a higher bid by increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep it the same and increase the digit. My hand is 27721915, which contains no 0s. The total count of 0s across all players is at least 4 since the bid is 4 0s. I can either bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. The next higher digit is not applicable here as 0 is the lowest digit, so I need to increase the quantity. Bidding 5 0s seems reasonable as it is a minimal increase in quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s, which is quite high considering there are only 40 digits in total and 5 players. I have one 0 in my hand (from my hand 41825596). Given that, it's unlikely that there are 5 0s across all players' hands. Therefore, challenging seems like the best option.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4, one 1, one 8, two 5s, two 9s, and one 6 in my hand. Since the current bid is None and I'm starting the bidding, I should make a conservative bid based on my hand. The digit 5 appears twice in my hand, so bidding 2 5s is a reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (79230633), I have zero 5s. Player 2 claims there are at least 3 5s total. Given there are 32 total digits and 4 active players, it's possible but I'd need Player 1 and Player 5 to have multiple 5s between them. However, Player 1's previous bid of only 2 5s suggests they don't have many 5s either. Given I have none and Player 1's earlier conservative bid, 3 5s seems unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 2. I have one 5 in my hand. Given that there are 24 total digits remaining and 3 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. The bid of 3 5s seems plausible but I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. Since I only have one 5, I don't have enough information to confidently make a higher bid on 5s. However, I can try to bid on a different digit. I have two 6s in my hand, which could be a good starting point.

Given that there are 24 total digits remaining and 3 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s, which means there would need to be at least two more 5s among the other two players' hands (Player 2 and Player 5). Given that the previous bid was 3 5s and Player 5 raised it to 4 5s, it's possible they have a strong hand. However, with only two other players, it's risky to assume they have at least two 5s combined. Challenging seems reasonable here.
