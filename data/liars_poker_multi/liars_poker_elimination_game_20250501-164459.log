Player 1 Reasoning: I see two 8s in my own hand. To make my bid safe, I want the required additional 8s among the 40 unknown digits to be small. By bidding 3 8s, I only need one more 8 in those 40 digits, which has about a 98% chance of occurring. This makes a challenge against me very risky for the next player. Choosing a high digit (8) also means future bidders must raise the quantity or go all the way up to 9s, putting extra pressure on them.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 3 but increase the digit. Bidding 3 9s is a valid and reasonable next step, as it is a higher digit with the same quantity. This bid is plausible given the total digits and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have one 0 in my hand (17641710). This means only one more 0 is needed among the remaining 32 digits (4 other players * 8 digits) for the bid to be true. The probability of this is very high (approx. 96.6%), so challenging is not advisable. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains three 1s, which is a strong count. I can make a safe and higher bid based on this. Bidding '2 1s' is a valid higher bid, but minimally increases the pressure. Bidding '3 1s' is also a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and is guaranteed to be true based on my hand alone (since I hold three 1s). This is a safe bid that increases the quantity and utilizes my strongest digit count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 1s' by Player 4 and my hand containing the digits 61523160, I notice I have one '1' in my hand. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 40 and there are 5 players, each with 8 digits, the maximum number of any single digit is capped at 40. Since the current bid is relatively low and my hand does not provide significant insight into higher digits being more abundant, I should consider the likelihood of '3 1s' being true. However, without concrete evidence to challenge or significantly raise the bid based on my hand, I must weigh the risk of challenging versus making a higher bid. Given that I only have one '1', and there's a possibility that other players might have more '1s', making a bid higher than '3 1s' could be risky. On the other hand, challenging '3 1s' might be a safer option if I believe that the total count of '1s' across all players is less than 3, considering the distribution of digits. Yet, with my limited information, making an educated challenge without more insight into other players' hands is speculative. Thus, considering the safer approach and the need to make a strategic move, I opt to make a minimal increase in the bid, focusing on a digit that I have some knowledge of, but realizing that my hand does not offer a clear advantage for a significantly higher bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s. With 32 unknown digits among the other four players, the expected number of additional 8s is about 3.2, so the chance there are at least two more is high (â‰ˆ84%). Raising the digit from 2 to 8 while keeping the quantity at 4 is a safe, legal way to top the current bid without risking an immediate 40% chance of being eliminated by challenging.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity above 4 or keep quantity at 4 and increase the digit above 8. The next possible bids are 4 9s or 5 0s. I have one 9 and one 0 as well. Bidding 4 9s is a valid and reasonable move since I hold a 9 and it is only a slight increase over the previous bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 2. I have zero 9s in my hand (17641710). This means the other 4 players (32 digits) must hold at least four 9s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 9s among those 32 digits is 3.2 (32/10). While challenging is plausible as the bid is slightly above average given my hand, I have a very strong alternative. I hold three 1s. Bidding 5 1s requires only two more 1s among the remaining 32 digits held by the other four players. The expected number of 1s in those 32 digits is 3.2. Furthermore, Player 5 previously bid 4 1s, suggesting they likely hold at least one 1, making my bid of 5 1s even more probable. Bidding 5 1s leverages my strong hand and information from the bidding history, making it a safer and more strategic move than challenging 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 1s and my hand containing 61523160, I notice I have two 1s. Considering the total digits remaining is 40 and there are 5 players, each having 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 40. Since I have two 1s, and the bid is 5 1s, it seems plausible that there could be at least 5 ones among all players, given that I only see two in my hand. However, bidding higher than 5 1s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. Given the high digit bids that have been made (4 8s, 4 9s), increasing the digit might not be the best strategy since higher digits have been heavily bid on. Increasing the quantity to 6 1s could be a reasonable bid, considering my hand and the fact that we are still early in the game, and no one has been eliminated in this round yet.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 2s in my hand, so all six 2s would have to come from the 32 unknown digits. With a uniform distribution, the expected count of 2s in those 32 digits is about 3, and the probability that there are 6 or more is well under 10%. This makes Player 0â€™s bid of 6 2s very unlikely to be correct. Challenging now gives me a high chance to eliminate them, whereas making a higher bid would put me at much greater risk of being challenged myself.

Player 1 Reasoning: Iâ€™m the opening bidder this round, so I have to make the first bid (challenging isnâ€™t possible yet). My hand contains two 8s. With 24 unknown digits still in play, the expected number of 8s among them is about 2.4, so needing only one more 8 to make a total of three is very likely (>90% chance). A bid of 3 8s is therefore well-supported, modest, and leaves me flexibility to move higher later if needed.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. There are 32 total digits among 4 players. The expected number of any digit is 3.2, making 3 9s a plausible bid, so challenging is risky. I need to bid higher. My hand is 17641710, containing three 1s. Bidding 4 1s requires only one more 1 among the remaining 24 digits held by the other 3 players, which is highly probable. This is the strongest bid I can make based on my hand. Although 1s were bid heavily last round, holding three of them makes 4 1s a statistically sound and safe bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 1s and I have one 1 in my hand, increasing the quantity seems risky without more information about other players' hands. However, considering the total digits remaining is 32 and there are only 4 active players, each with 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 32. Since I have one 1 and the bid is 4 1s, I should consider if it's likely that there are at least 4 ones among all players. With my hand having one 1, and without knowing the exact distribution of digits among other players, challenging seems like a reasonable option if I believe the current bid is unlikely. Given that the total number of digits is 32 and we are bidding on the count of a specific digit across all players, the bid of 4 1s might be plausible but challenging it could provide insight or advantage if I'm right.

Player 4 Reasoning: I am Player 4 and it's my turn to make the first bid in this round. There are 3 players (Player 1, Player 2, Player 4) and 24 total digits. My hand is 17641710. I have three 1s, two 7s, one 0, one 4, and one 6. The expected average count for any digit is 2.4 (24 digits / 10 possible digits). Since I hold three 1s myself, bidding '3 1s' is a very strong and likely true opening bid. It leverages the most frequent digit in my hand and sets a reasonable starting point for the bidding. This bid is also consistent with my previous bidding history where I bid on 1s multiple times and won a challenge on '4 1s' when the actual count was 6.

Conversely, I have no 1s, so challenging the current bid would rely purely on luck. The prudent move is to raise to 3 8s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 2. I have zero 9s in my hand (17641710). For the bid to be true, the other two players (Player 1 and Player 2) must have at least three 9s combined in their 16 digits. While the expected number of 9s in those 16 digits is only 1.6 (16 * 0.1), Player 2 has bid 9s previously, suggesting they might hold some. Challenging is tempting because I hold none, but it carries the risk of elimination if the bid is correct (approx. 21% chance based on random distribution, potentially higher given bidding history). A safer and stronger move is to bid based on my own hand. I hold three 1s. Bidding 4 1s requires only one additional 1 among the other 16 digits held by Player 1 and Player 2. The probability of there being at least one more 1 is high (approx. 81.5%). This bid is statistically sound, leverages my hand's strength, follows my previous bid of 3 1s, and puts pressure on the next player.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 1s, so I would lose if only a few 1s exist, but last round the revealed total among the four players (me, 2, 4, 5) was 6 1s. Now only Player 5 has been removed. Because Player 5 had challenged that 4 1s bid, they almost certainly held at most one 1 themselves, meaning Players 2 and 4 still have about 5 or more 1s between them. Player 4â€™s continued focus on bidding 1s also signals a large personal count. Therefore challenging 4 1s is too dangerousâ€”it's very likely true. Instead, I should raise the quantity while keeping the digit that is clearly abundant. Moving to 5 1s is a strictly higher bid and is still highly plausible, putting pressure on the others without relying on less certain digits like my 8s or 6s.

Bidding 6 1s puts pressure on the next player and is a reasonable step up from 5 1s based on my hand and the total digits.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand (17641710). The current bid is 6 1s made by Player 2. This means Player 1 and Player 2 combined need to have at least three 1s for the bid to be true. Player 1 previously bid 5 1s, and Player 2 raised to 6 1s, suggesting they both believe there are many 1s and likely hold some themselves. Challenging 6 1s seems risky because it's plausible (e.g., I have 3, P1 has 2, P2 has 1). Bidding higher is the better option. Bidding on a different digit at quantity 6 (like 6 7s, based on my two 7s) is possible but requires needing 4 more 7s from the other 16 cards. Given the focus on 1s, escalating the bid to 7 1s seems like a strong strategic move. I have three 1s, and need four more from the other 16 cards held by players who have already bid high on 1s. This is plausible (e.g., P1 has 2, P2 has 2) and puts the pressure back on Player 1.

Player 1 Reasoning: I hold eight digits and none of them are 0. Therefore all three 0s claimed in the bid would have to be in Player 2â€™s eight-digit hand. With a random distribution, the probability of getting at least 3 zeros in 8 digits is about 3.8 %. Such a low likelihood makes the current bid very suspect, so challenging is the best move.
