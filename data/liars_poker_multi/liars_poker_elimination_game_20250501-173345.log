Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s by Player 0, which is a very low bid and likely to be true since it's the minimum possible bid. I have no 0s in my hand (61734386), but with 48 total digits across 6 players, it's almost certain that at least one 0 exists among the other players. Challenging this bid would be risky and likely result in a loss for me. Instead, I will make a higher bid. Since I have two 3s in my hand, bidding 2 3s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 1 0s, and I can support part of the count myself.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have one '3' in my hand. Since the bid is low and must be strictly increased, I can raise the quantity to 3 or increase the digit with the same quantity. Given that 3 is a low digit and the quantity is low, it is reasonable to increase the quantity to 3 3s, which is a valid and safe bid based on my hand and the total digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (79144852), I don't have any 3s. Player 2 has bid 3 3s, which means they believe there are at least 3 threes among all 48 digits. This is a relatively low bid considering there are 6 players with 8 digits each. Even without any 3s in my hand, it's quite likely that other players combined have at least 3 threes. I should make a higher bid. I have two 4s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 4s. I could bid 3 4s (same quantity but higher digit) or 4 4s (higher quantity). Since I already know of 2 fours in my hand, bidding 4 4s means I only need 2 more fours among the other 40 digits held by other players, which seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 0, 5, 7, 6, 9, 3, 3, 6. Counting the 4s in my hand, I have none, so I cannot confidently raise the bid based on my own cards. The current bid is 4 4s, which seems quite high given the total of 48 digits and the previous bids. Since challenging might be risky if the count of 4s is actually less than 4, I will instead attempt to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid move. I can bid 4 5s, which is higher than 4 4s, and plausible given the total digits and my hand. This move also puts pressure on the previous bidder and keeps the game going.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. In my hand, I have one 5 (43086520). The current bid is 4 5s by Player 4. If I were to challenge, I would need to believe there are fewer than 4 5s total among all players. Since I already have 1, that means I'd need to believe there are fewer than 3 among the other 5 players, which seems unlikely. On average, each digit appears about 4.8 times across all hands (48 total digits ÷ 10 possible digits). So 4 5s is actually a reasonable bid. I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, which could help support a bid on 0s. I could bid 5 5s (increasing quantity) or 4 6s (same quantity, higher digit). I'll choose 4 6s since I don't have any 6s in my hand, but it's still a reasonable quantity given the distribution of digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 61734386, which contains one 7. The current bid is 4 7s by Player 0. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an average of 4.8 sevens would be expected if distributed evenly, so 4 sevens is plausible. However, since I only have one 7, it means the other 5 players must collectively have at least 3 more sevens, which is possible but not guaranteed. Bidding higher, such as 5 7s or 4 8s, feels risky given my limited information on 7s and no 8s in my hand. I could challenge, but the bid of 4 7s is statistically reasonable. I’ll play it safe and bid higher with 4 8s, as it’s a minimal increase and keeps the game moving while testing the waters.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 8s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of this bid. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since the current quantity is 4, I can bid 4 9s to raise the digit while keeping the quantity. This is a reasonable increment given my hand and the current bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The bid is at 4 9s, and I need to either make a higher bid or challenge. Looking at my hand (79144852), I have zero 9s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For there to be at least 4 9s, the other 5 players would need to have at least 4 9s among them, which is certainly possible. The bidding has been relatively conservative so far, with quantities not exceeding 4. Since I don't have any 9s in my hand, I can't contribute to the count, but 4 9s across the other 5 players (with 40 digits) is still quite reasonable. I should make a higher bid. The next higher bid would be 5 0s. Looking at my hand, I have zero 0s as well, so I'm not contributing to this count either, but it's a reasonable next step in the bidding sequence.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s, which is quite high. Given my hand (0,5,7,6,9,3,3,6), I have only one 0, so the total count of zeros across all hands is unlikely to reach 5. The previous bids on other digits (3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s, 9s) seem plausible, but challenging the 5 0s bid is reasonable because it's unlikely that the total number of zeros across all players reaches five, especially with only one zero in my hand. Challenging here is a strategic move to eliminate the previous bidder if they are overestimating the count of zeros.

Player 4 Reasoning: The previous round ended with a challenge on Player 3's bid of 5 0s, which was incorrect since the actual count was 4. Now, with no current bid, I have the opportunity to start the bidding. Looking at my hand (0,5,7,6,9,3,3,6), I have one 0, one 5, two 3s, one 6, one 7, and one 9. The most conservative approach is to bid slightly higher than the minimum, such as '1 0s', but since Player 0 started the round and no previous bid exists, I can bid 1 0s to establish a baseline. Alternatively, I could bid higher to put pressure on others. Considering my hand, I have only one 0, so bidding 1 0s is safe and reasonable to start.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand (the 5th digit). Player 4 has just bid 1 0s, which is a very conservative opening bid. Given that I already have one 0, and there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total digits), it's highly likely there are more than just one 0 across all hands. I could safely bid 2 0s or increase the digit. Since I have two 2s in my hand, I could bid on 2s, but I'll start by simply raising the quantity of 0s to establish a baseline.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 61734386, and I have one 1 in my hand. The current bid is 2 1s by Player 0. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, it's plausible that there are at least 2 ones across all hands, especially since I have one myself. I don't want to challenge this bid as it seems reasonable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Since I have two 3s in my hand, bidding 3 3s feels safe and is a valid higher bid (higher quantity and digit than 2 1s). This keeps the game moving and leverages the strength in my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s, and I have the digits 0,5,7,6,9,3,3,6. I can see I have two 3s and one 6. The total number of 4s across all players is unlikely to reach 4, given my hand and the bids so far. Bidding 4 4s would be aggressive and risky, especially since I only have two 3s and two 6s, and no other 4s. Challenging seems safer because the total number of 4s is probably less than 4, making the last bid overestimating the count.

I don't think challenging is wise here since the bid is conservative. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 3 6s feels reasonable—it increases both the quantity and the digit, and I know at least two 6s exist.

Since there are 24 total digits across all three players, it's possible that there is at least one more 8 in the other players' hands to make the total of 3 8s. However, I need to make a higher bid. I can bid 4 of any digit or 3 of a higher digit like 9. Given that I have two 8s, bidding 4 8s might be risky as it requires two more 8s to exist in the remaining 16 digits. Instead, I’ll bid 3 9s since it’s a minimal increase and I have no information about 9s in other hands, making it a safer bluff if needed. I could also consider challenging, but with only two 8s in my hand, it’s plausible the third 8 exists, so challenging might be too risky.
