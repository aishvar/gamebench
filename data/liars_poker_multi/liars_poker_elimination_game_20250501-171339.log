Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and the first bidder in this round with 6 active players (48 total digits). My hand is 16715832. I have two 1s, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. The expected number of any specific digit across all 48 digits is 4.8. Since I already possess two 1s, it's statistically likely that there are at least two more 1s among the remaining 40 digits held by other players. A bid of '4 1s' is therefore a safe opening bid based on my hand, likely to be true, and sets a reasonable starting point for the bidding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I currently hold three 3s. The existing bid is 4 1s. By bidding 4 3s I raise the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which legally surpasses the current bid. Since only one additional 3 is needed among the remaining 40 hidden digits for the bid to be valid, this is a statistically safe and strategic move.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 6s in my eight digits. The current bid is 4 3s. Across the remaining 40 unknown digits, the expected count of any specific digit is about 4, so needing just two more 6s to reach a total of four is very likely (roughly a 92% chance). Raising the digit while keeping the same quantity gives me a strong, defensible bid without jumping the quantity too fast.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s. Bidding 5 6s increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 6s and pushes the bid higher without relying on others' hands.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 5 6s, which means there must be at least five 6s among all 48 digits. With six players, the expected number of 6s is around 4.8 (48/10). Since I hold two, there would need to be at least three more among the other 40 digits. This is plausible, so challenging is risky. To outbid, I can either raise the quantity or bid 5 7s. I have one 7, so bidding 5 7s is reasonable and safer than increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s, which means at least five 7s exist among all players. I have no 7s in my hand, only one 9, one 5, one 3, one 6, one 0, one 4, and one 8. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can either increase the quantity or keep quantity at 5 and increase the digit. I have one 9, which is the highest digit, so bidding 5 9s is a plausible move. Given that 5 7s is already a moderately high bid and I have a 9, bidding 5 9s is a reasonable and valid increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. With 48 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 4.8. So, 5 is only slightly above average and plausible. I have zero 9s in my hand (16715832), meaning the other 5 players (40 digits) must have at least five 9s. The expected number of 9s among those 40 digits is 4. While slightly higher than expected, it's not unreasonable enough to guarantee a successful challenge. Challenging carries the risk of elimination if the bid is correct. A safer option is to bid higher. The next possible bid quantity is 6. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s. Bidding 6 1s requires four 1s among the other 40 digits. The expected number of 1s in those 40 digits is exactly 4 (40/10). Therefore, bidding 6 1s is statistically supported by my hand and seems like a strong, defensible bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Challenging 6 1s is risky. Player 0 opened with 4 1s and later pushed it up to 6, suggesting they likely hold several 1s; the chance there are 6 or more 1s on the table could easily be above 50%. Instead, I hold three 3s myself (98633389), so to meet a bid of 6 3s we only need three more 3s among the 40 unseen digits. The probability of that is high (around 78%). By keeping the quantity at 6 and raising the digit from 1 to 3, I make the smallest legal higher bid while basing it on a digit I’m strong in, minimizing my elimination risk and putting pressure on the next player to either accept a tough bid or raise further.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I can see two 6s in my own hand. Earlier in this round Player 3 already felt confident enough to bid 5 6s, so moving to 6 6s is only one more than a previously accepted quantity. With 40 unknown digits left, the expected number of 6s among them is about 4, giving an overall expectation of roughly 6 total 6s. That makes the bid plausible while still legally raising the current bid of 6 3s by keeping the quantity the same but choosing a higher digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. My hand contains two 6s, but the total number of 6s across all players is uncertain. Since there are 48 digits total and I only have two 6s, it's plausible the actual count is less than 6. Challenging this bid could eliminate the bidder if the total is indeed insufficient.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. In the last round, with only one extra player, the revealed total of 6s was 8. Even if the eliminated player held one of those 6s, there would still be about 7 left among the 40 digits now in play, giving a strong cushion above the four I’m about to claim. Since I must open the bidding and want a safe but solid starting point, 4 6s is a low-risk choice.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand (02147641), I have one 6. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in total. The current bid is 4 6s, which is a conservative opening bid. Statistically, each digit appears about 4 times (40/10). Since I have only one 6, it's possible there are three or more among the other 32 digits. The bid is not aggressive enough to challenge. To make a strictly higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and raise the digit. I have two 1s and one 4, so bidding 4 7s (I have one 7) is riskier, but bidding 4 4s is reasonable since I have one 4. However, increasing the quantity to 5 is also an option. Given the data, I'll bid 4 7s to keep the quantity but raise the digit, as 7s are less likely to be heavily concentrated early.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s, and I must bid higher. My hand contains one 9 and one 5, which doesn't strongly support 7s. Increasing the quantity to 5 is a safer increment. Since 5 7s is the next higher bid after 4 7s, I will bid 5 7s to keep the pressure on and not challenge prematurely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. The expected average count for any digit is 40/10 = 4. A bid of 5 is slightly above average but plausible. I have one 7 in my hand (16715832), meaning the bid requires four more 7s among the remaining 32 digits held by the other 4 players. This is statistically possible (average needed would be 3.2). Challenging feels risky as the bid isn't excessively high. I need to make a higher bid. Options include 5 8s, 5 9s, 6 0s, 6 1s, etc. My hand contains two 1s. Bidding 6 1s leverages this information. It requires four additional 1s from the remaining 32 digits, which is plausible (average is 3.2). This seems like a safer and more informed bid than challenging or bidding on digits I hold fewer of.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my own hand. To make a bid of 6 3s, I would only need at least three more 3s among the remaining 32 hidden digits. With each digit appearing with roughly 10% probability, the expected number of 3s in those 32 digits is a bit over 3, so the likelihood that there are at least three more is solid (well above 50%). Raising the digit from 1 to 3 keeps the quantity at 6 while legally out-bidding Player 0. This seems safer than challenging a bid that Player 0 probably made because they hold several 1s themselves.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I see only two 3s in my hand. For the current bid of 6 3s to be true, there must be at least four more 3s in the 32 unknown digits (0.1 × 32 ≈ 3.2 expected). The probability of there being four or more is under 50%, so challenging gives me better than even odds to eliminate Player 1. Any raise I could make (e.g., 6 6s) would have a similar or worse success probability and exposes me to being challenged later. Therefore, challenging now is the best move.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 02147641, which contains two 4s, two 1s, one 0, one 2, one 6, and one 7. The current bid is 4 3s. With 32 total digits and 8 per player, the expected count of any digit is about 3.2. I have zero 3s, so for 4 3s to be true, the other three players would need to collectively have all 4 or more 3s, which is possible but not especially likely. However, it is not so improbable as to justify an immediate challenge, and the bid is still low. I should make a safe, incremental bid based on my hand. I have two 4s, so bidding 4 4s is reasonable and strictly higher than the current bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s, meaning there are at least four 4s among all players' digits. I have only one 4 in my hand, which makes this bid plausible but not overly certain. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. I can bid 4 5s or higher. I have two 5s in my hand, which supports bidding 4 5s. This is a reasonable increase and keeps the bid believable.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. There are 32 total digits. The expected number of any digit is 32/10 = 3.2. I have one 5 in my hand (16715832). For the bid to be true, there must be at least 3 more 5s among the other 24 digits held by the other 3 players. The expected number of 5s in those 24 digits is 2.4. Needing 3 when 2.4 are expected is quite plausible, making a challenge risky. I should look for a higher bid. My hand contains two 1s. Bidding 5 1s requires 3 more 1s from the remaining 24 digits. Since I hold two 1s, this bid is well-supported by my hand and statistically reasonable (needing 3 when 2.4 are expected among the others). This seems stronger than bidding 4 of a higher digit or challenging.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 1s in my own eight-digit hand. Across 32 total digits, the expected number of 1s is only about 3.2. For the bid of 5 1s to be true, the other three players would need at least five 1s between them, which is well above expectation (roughly a 30% chance at best). Given that I contribute none, the bid is much more likely to be an overstatement than accurate. Challenging now gives me a strong chance (≈70%) to knock Player 0 out and reduce the field to three players.

A safer path is to raise the bid: I hold two 9s, so only one more 9 is needed among the 16 unknown digits. The probability of at least one 9 there is 1 – 0.9^16 ≈ 82 %, giving me good protection if challenged while legally surpassing the bid by increasing the digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 02147641, which contains no 9s. The current bid is 3 9s. Since I have 0, there must be at least 3 9s among the 16 digits held by the other two players. The probability of this is moderate but not extremely unlikely, so a challenge could be risky. To stay in the game and avoid a marginal challenge, I will make a minimal higher bid: 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: It is the first bid of the round, so any legal bid is acceptable. In my 8-digit hand I already have three 3s (98633389). That guarantees the total number of 3s across both hands is at least three, no matter what Player 4 holds. Opening with 3 3s is therefore completely safe for me while still being a respectable starting bid that uses my strongest digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have the hand 02147641, which contains the following digits: 0, 2, 1, 4, 7, 6, 4, 1. Counting the 3s in my hand: there are zero. The current bid is 3 3s, meaning there must be at least three 3s between both hands (16 digits total). Since I have zero 3s, Player 1 would need to have all three (or more) in their own hand. The probability of one player holding three or more of a given digit in 8 digits is low (the expected count is 0.8 for any digit per hand), making this bid quite risky. Therefore, it is optimal to challenge.
