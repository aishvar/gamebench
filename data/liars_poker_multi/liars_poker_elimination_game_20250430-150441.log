Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Starting the bidding with a moderate quantity like 4 6s seems reasonable, considering the total possible digits across all players and the need to establish a baseline bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand is 81080232, which contains two 6s (at positions 3 and 6, 0-indexed). To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I have two 6s, it's possible others have 6s as well, but I should be cautious. Bidding 5 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, bidding on a higher digit like 3 7s or higher is also an option, but given my hand doesn't have any 7s or higher digits in abundance, I'll stick with increasing the quantity of 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher than '5 6s' or challenge. Looking at my hand (21416015), I have zero 6s. Player 1 has bid that there are at least 5 sixes among all players. Since I have none, all 5 would need to be in the other 5 players' hands. That's certainly possible (1 six per player on average), but not guaranteed. However, since the bid is still relatively low (5 out of a possible 48 digits), it's more likely to be true than false. I should make a higher bid. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding on 1s gives me some confidence. I'll bid '6 1s' which is higher than '5 6s' by increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s, meaning there are at least six '1's among all players. I have one '1' in my hand. The previous bids indicate an increasing count of 6s and then a switch to 1s with a quantity of 6. Since the digit must increase if the quantity stays the same, the next valid bids must be either a higher quantity than 6 or the same quantity of 6 but a digit higher than 1. Considering the rarity of '1's and my hand, bidding 6 2s is a reasonable next step, as I have one '3' and one '4' but no '2's, so I am not overcommitting. Increasing the digit to 2 with the same quantity of 6 is a valid and safe move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 2s made by Player 4. I have two 7s in my hand, which could significantly contribute to a higher bid. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48 and there are 6 active players with 8 digits each, I should consider the potential for higher digits. Bidding 8 7s seems ambitious but possible given my hand and the total number of digits available. However, I must be cautious not to overbid. A more conservative approach would be to increase the quantity or digit slightly. I will bid 8 7s, as it is a strict increase in digit and a reasonable quantity given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 7s. The average expected count for any digit across 48 total digits is 4.8, which is significantly lower than 8. I hold one 7, meaning the remaining 5 players would need to collectively have 7 more 7s to meet the bid. This is statistically unlikely given the average distribution. Challenging this bid is the most strategic move.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (81080232), so I know there are at least 2 6s. With 3 other players having 8 digits each, it's plausible there are at least 5 6s in total. I can make a higher bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 5 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (21416015), I have 1 six. The current bid is 5 6s from Player 1. Since there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total digits), and I have 1 six, there would need to be at least 4 more sixes among the other players for the bid to be valid. This is certainly possible, but not guaranteed. In the previous round, Player 0 also bid on 6s (4 6s), which suggests they might have some 6s in their hand. Looking at my own hand, I notice I have 3 ones, which gives me confidence to bid on 1s. I could bid 6 1s, but that was already bid in the previous round, suggesting 1s might be common. I'll bid 6 6s, increasing the quantity by 1, which is a reasonable escalation given the game state.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have one 6 in my hand, which slightly supports the bid but does not strongly confirm it. Increasing the bid to 7 6s is a safe incremental increase and still plausible given the total of 40 digits. Bidding 7 6s puts pressure on the next player without risking an unlikely jump.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have 6s in my hand. The current highest bid is 7 6s made by Player 3. I can increase the quantity to 8 or keep the digit the same but increase the quantity to 7. Since I have 6s in my hand, I can safely bid 8 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The expected number of 6s in 40 total digits is 4 (10% of 40). With only two 6s in my hand, the bid of 8 6s requires at least six additional 6s across four opponents. Given the statistical unlikelihood of doubling the average count and the aggressive prior bidding pattern suggesting potential bluffing, challenging is the optimal move.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With 32 total digits remaining across 4 players, bidding 4 6s is a conservative starting bid that accounts for my holdings and historical bidding patterns in previous rounds. This quantity is plausible given the reduced player count compared to earlier 8 6s bids that failed.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s and 8 digits in my hand. The total count of 6s must be at least 2 (mine) plus whatever Player 0 has. Given that there are 32 total digits and a relatively high bid was made in the previous round on 6s, it's plausible that the count is higher. I can bid higher than 4 6s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s, I can reasonably assume there are at least 4 or 5 6s in total. I will increase the quantity to 5 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (21416015), I have one 6 in it. Player 1 has bid 5 6s total across all players. With 4 players having 8 digits each, there are 32 total digits. For there to be 5 6s, the other players would need to have 4 more 6s among them. This is possible but not guaranteed. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Since I have two 1s in my hand, I could reasonably bid 6 1s, which would be higher than 5 6s. This seems like a safer move than challenging, as 5 6s is entirely plausible. In fact, I made this exact bid (6 1s) in a previous round, suggesting I had confidence in it before.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have one '1' in my hand, so the total count could be close to 6 but not guaranteed. The last bid was 6 1s, so I must bid higher. I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since 6 is the current quantity, the next valid bids could be 6 2s or higher quantity bids starting from 7 0s. I have two '3's and one '4' in my hand, but no '2's. Bidding 6 2s might be risky without any '2's in my hand. Increasing the quantity to 7 0s is a safer and more believable bid, as '0's could be common and I have one '0' in my hand. Therefore, I will bid 7 0s to raise the quantity and digit reasonably.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. I have only one 0 in my hand. With 32 total digits remaining, there would need to be six more 0s distributed among the other three players' hands (24 digits). Statistically, this seems unlikely given the average distribution and previous successful challenges against inflated bids. Challenging this bid carries a reasonable risk-reward balance.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s and 1 eight in my hand (81080232). The total count of 6s across all players must be at least 4 to validate the current bid. Given the previous rounds' bidding patterns and outcomes, it seems players tend to bid aggressively but sometimes get challenged successfully. I can see that I have two 6s, so it's plausible that there are at least 4 6s in total among the 3 players. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have confidence in the count of 6s being at least 5 (my two 6s and potentially at least one from each of the other two players), I can bid 5 6s. Alternatively, bidding 4 7s or higher digit is also an option if I think the count of 6s is exactly 4. However, given my hand and the history, I believe bidding 5 6s is a reasonable and safe choice.

Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (21416015), I have zero 6s. Player 1 has bid 5 6s, which means they're claiming there are at least 5 sixes among all players. Since I have none, those 5 sixes would need to be distributed between Player 0 and Player 1 (8 digits each). Looking at the history, in the previous round when Player 4 bid 8 6s, it was revealed there were only 5 sixes total among 5 players (40 digits). Now we have only 3 players (24 digits), so it's unlikely the count of 6s has remained at 5. Also, Player 0 consistently opens with '4 6s' across rounds, suggesting they might have some 6s. However, Player 1 immediately raising to '5 6s' seems suspicious. I think the actual count is likely 4 or fewer, making '5 6s' an overestimate. I'll challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I'm starting the final round against Player 0. Looking at my hand (21416015), I have one 1, two 1s, one 4, one 6, one 0, one 1, and one 5. I need to make the first bid of this round. Since I have one 6, I could start with a low bid of '1 6s'. However, in previous rounds, Player 0 has consistently opened with '4 6s', which suggests they might have multiple 6s. I could start with a digit I have multiple of - I have two 1s in my hand. A conservative opening bid would be '2 1s', which I know is true from my hand alone. This gives me room to maneuver as the bidding progresses while starting with a digit I have strength in.

Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. There are only 2 players left (Player 0 and myself), with 8 digits each, for a total of 16 digits. The current bid is '2 6s' made by Player 0. Looking at my hand (21416015), I have zero 6s. Since Player 0 bid 2 6s, they must have at least 2 sixes in their hand (or they're bluffing). I could raise to '3 6s', but that would be risky since I don't have any 6s myself. I could also bid a different digit that I have more of - I have two 1s in my hand. I could bid '2 7s', '2 8s', or '2 9s', but I don't have any of those digits. Looking at previous rounds, Player 0 seems to favor bidding 6s, which might indicate they genuinely have several 6s. Given that I have no 6s in my hand, and the bid is already at 2 6s, I think challenging is the best move here.
