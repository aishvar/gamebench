Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With five other players holding 40 unknown digits, it's likely there’s at least one more 6 among them. A reasonable safe opening bid is 3 sixes, leveraging my two while setting a moderate baseline.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. With 5 other players, it's possible there are at least 3 6s in total. However, the current bid is already at 3 6s, so I need to make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity to 4 or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit. Since I have a 9 in my hand, bidding 3 9s is a safer option as it's less likely to be challenged and still meets the bid increase requirement.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 31587104, which contains no 9s. The current bid is 3 9s by Player 1. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits, a bid of 3 9s is plausible as it represents a small fraction of the total digits. I don't have strong evidence to challenge this bid, as it's a low quantity. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding 4 1s feels reasonable, increasing the quantity from 3 to 4 and switching to a digit I have some confidence in.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8.  A bid of 4 1s is slightly below the average, but with Player 2 having made the bid, it's plausible they have one or two 1s.  My hand has several 4s and 6s. Bidding 4 4s or 4 6s is a valid higher bid and aligns with my hand. Bidding 4 4s is a safer increase in digit than 4 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I hold two 6s in my hand. Statistically, among the 40 unseen digits (5 other players × 8 digits), roughly four more 6s are expected, so needing only two more to reach a total of four is quite plausible. By keeping the quantity the same (4) but increasing the digit from 4 to 6, I make a higher yet still conservative bid that is well-supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (77155554), I don't have any 6s. The current bid claims there are at least 4 sixes among all players. Player 4 increased the quantity from Player 0's original bid of '3 6s' to '4 6s', suggesting they might have some 6s. However, given that I have zero 6s in my hand, and we've seen relatively conservative bidding so far (mostly quantity 3-4), it seems unlikely there are 4 sixes total. If there were 4 sixes, they would need to be distributed among the other 5 players, which is possible but risky. Given my complete lack of 6s and the bidding pattern, challenging seems like the safer option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I am the first to act this round, so I must open with a bid. I hold two 2s. With 32 unknown digits in the other players’ hands, the expected additional count of any specific digit is about 3.2. The probability that there are at least two more 2s (giving a total of 4 or more) is well over 80%, making 4 2s a statistically safe opening. This quantity is reasonable for a first bid and still leaves room for future raises.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid of 4 2s is quite plausible, so a challenge is risky. Bidding 4 6s is valid (same quantity, higher digit) and likely to hold: with my two plus an expected ~3.2 more among the other 32 cards, the total ≥4 with probability ~84%.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s, which was just made by Player 0. Given that there are 40 total digits and 5 players, the average count per digit is 4. However, since the previous challenge showed 7 6s when there were 6 players, it's plausible that there are still a significant number of 6s in play. To stay competitive, I will increase the bid by raising the digit to 7s, keeping the quantity the same.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 31587104, which contains one 7. The current bid is 4 7s by Player 1. With 5 players and 40 total digits, it's possible but not highly likely that there are 4 sevens across all hands since I only have one. However, challenging carries a risk of elimination if I'm wrong. I can make a safer bid by increasing the digit to 8s while keeping the quantity at 4. I have one 8 in my hand, so bidding 4 8s feels reasonable as a conservative increase, testing the waters without overcommitting. I’ll avoid challenging for now and bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand has two 4s, two 6s, one 9, one 1, one 0. The current bid is 4 8s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. The current bid is exactly the average. I have no 8s in my hand. While 4 8s is possible, I find it slightly less likely than the average, especially since I don't have any. Bidding higher would require a significant jump in quantity or a higher digit, which I don't feel comfortable doing based on my hand. Challenging seems like a reasonable risk given the lack of 8s in my hand and the average distribution.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round with no current bid to beat, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand is 31587104, which gives me two 1s, one 3, one 5, one 7, one 8, one 0, and one 4. Since I have two 1s, bidding 3 1s seems reasonable as it is likely that at least one other player has a 1 in their hand, given there are 32 total digits across 4 players. This bid keeps the quantity low to minimize risk while leveraging a digit I have strength in.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. The current bid is 3 1s, so to raise I can keep the quantity at 3 and choose a higher digit. By bidding 3 2s I only need one additional 2 among the remaining 24 unseen digits, which is very likely. This is a safe, legal increase that avoids the risk of an early challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, so to reach a total of three 6s I need only one more among the 24 unknown digits. The chance of at least one more 6 is about 1 – 0.9^24 ≈ 92%, making “3 6s” a very safe bid. It also properly outbids the current “3 2s” by keeping the quantity at 3 and raising the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which seems plausible given the previous round's outcome where 4 6s were challenged and the actual count was 7. To stay competitive, I can bid 3 9s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, based on the one 9 in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:3 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 1. In my hand (31587104), I have no 9s, which means I contribute nothing to the count of 9s. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 3 9s means that on average, each player would need to have less than 1 nine in their hand, which is plausible. However, I can make a higher bid to keep the game moving. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding 4 1s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and I can support part of the count. This bid feels safer than challenging a low bid of 3 9s, which could easily be true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I hold two 2s. To satisfy a bid of 4 2s the other 24 hidden digits would need to contain at least two more 2s, which has roughly a 70% probability. Challenging 4 1s only gives me about a 44% chance to win since I have just one 1. Therefore, raising the bid to 4 2s is safer than challenging and keeps the quantity low.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. To make the bid 4 6s, I need at least two more 6s among the other 24 unknown cards. That has roughly a 71% chance (Binomial(24,0.1) P(X≥2)). This is a stronger play than challenging the improbable 4 2s (challenge success ~56%) and uses my strongest digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s, which seems plausible given the previous round's outcome where the actual count was 7. However, with only 32 digits remaining and 4 players, it's risky to bid higher. I have a 9 in my hand, so I can bid 4 9s, which is a higher digit but same quantity, to keep the game going without taking too much risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 1. In my hand, I have no 9s, which means I contribute nothing to the count of 9s. With 32 total digits across all players, a bid of 4 9s means that the other three players would need to have at least 4 9s among their 24 digits. This is possible but not highly likely, as it would require an average of more than 1.3 9s per player. However, since the bid is relatively low compared to the total digits, and I have no information about others' hands, challenging might be risky. Instead, I can make a safer bid by increasing the quantity or digit. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding on 1s could be reasonable. I’ll bid 5 1s, as it increases the quantity and leverages the strength in my own hand, making it a believable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have only one 1 in my eight digits. For the bid of 5 1s to be correct, at least four more 1s must be hidden in the other 24 digits. With each unknown digit having a 10% chance of being a 1, the expected number of additional 1s is about 2.4, and the probability of there being four or more is roughly 20%. That makes Player 2’s bid quite unlikely, so challenging gives me close to an 80% chance of success and a chance to eliminate a competitor.

Player 4 Reasoning: Because I am the first to act this round there is no current bid, so I can choose any valid opening. I hold two 2s in my hand. With 24 total digits in play, the expected average for any digit is about 2.4, and the probability that at least one more 2 exists among the other 16 hidden digits is over 80%.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I hold two 6s in my hand, so bidding 3 6s is the lowest same-quantity, higher-digit bid. Only one more 6 is needed among the 16 unknown cards, and the probability of at least one additional 6 is about 81%, making this a safe raise.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which means there needs to be at least two more 6s among the other two players' hands. Given that the previous round had a bid of 4 6s that was challenged and found to have 7 6s, it's plausible that there are still several 6s in play. However, with only 24 digits remaining and two other players, it's risky to bid higher. I have a 9 in my hand, so I can bid 3 9s, which is a higher digit but same quantity, making it a valid bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s. Earlier this round Player 0 confidently bid 3 6s, which strongly suggests they hold at least two 6s themselves. My two plus their likely two already make four, even before considering whatever 6s Player 1 might have. So the total count of 6s is very probably at least four.
