Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I should make a conservative opening bid based on my hand. I have two 0s, two 2s, and one each of 4, 5, 6, and 7. Since 2s are most frequent in my hand, bidding 2 2s is safe and reasonable as an opening move.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 2 6s is a valid higher bid than 2 2s and is guaranteed to be truthful since my hand contains at least two 6s. This avoids the risk of challenging when the current bid is likely valid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s. With 6 players, the average number of any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8. Two 6s is a very low bid and quite likely to be true. I can bid higher. I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s is a reasonable increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I hold two 8s, and with 40 other cards there are on average four more 8s, so the bid is safe. To minimally increase, I can raise the digit at the same quantity to 3 9s. I have one 9 and expect about four more among others, making 3 9s a reasonable raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand contains one 9, so I can only contribute at most one 9. Bidding 4 9s is impossible since I have only one 9. The next higher bid would be 4 0s, but I only have one 0. Considering the total digits, it's unlikely that there are 4 zeros among all players. Challenging the current bid seems the best move, as the probability that there are at least 4 zeros in total is very low given the remaining total of 48 digits and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Since no previous bid has been made in this round, I can start by making a conservative bid based on my hand. I have the digits 5, 7, 5, 3, 4, 2, 9, 8. Counting the number of 5s, I see two 5s. To be safe, I will bid 2 5s, which is a reasonable opening bid considering the total of 40 digits and my hand. This bid is higher than the starting point and sets a baseline for others.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, ensuring there are at least two 8s across all 40 digits. Raising to 2 8s is a minimal safe increase over 2 5s and is strictly higher by digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. In my hand (60220457), I have no 8s. There are 5 players, so 40 digits in play. The bid is not aggressive; it's quite likely that among 40 digits, there are at least 2 eights. Challenging is risky at this stage. Therefore, I should make a higher bid. I have two 2s and two 0s in my hand. Bidding 3 2s is a safe escalation, as I already hold two myself, making it plausible that at least one more exists among the remaining 32 digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s, which requires at least three 2s in total. Since I have two, it's risky to challenge if others have even one more. Bidding 3 6s (same quantity, higher digit) is a logical next move based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand (78806257). The current bid is 3 6s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. This suggests that 3 6s is a plausible bid. I have two 8s, and bidding 4 8s is a reasonable increase over 3 6s, as it's a higher quantity and a higher digit. It's also a plausible bid given my hand and the number of players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s, which is quite high, but given the total of 40 digits and the fact that each player has 8 digits, the maximum number of 8s across all players is 5 (if everyone had all 8s). Since the bid of 4 8s is close to this maximum, it's very unlikely that there are 4 or more 8s in total. Challenging now seems prudent because the bid is probably false, and the risk of losing a challenge is minimal. Bidding higher on the same digit (8) isn't possible because 4 8s is the highest bid for 8s, and the only option would be to challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: It is the start of a new round and I am the first to bid. I have two 8s in my hand. With 4 players and 32 total digits, a bid of 2 8s is very conservative and likely to be true. I will start with a low bid based on my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: I hold two 8s. The current bid is 2 8s. With 24 unknown digits and an expected 2.4 more 8s among them, it’s very likely there’s at least one additional 8. Raising the quantity to 3 while keeping the digit at 8 is a minimal valid increase and still quite plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (60220457), I have one 8. The current bid is 3 8s. With 32 digits in play and only needing to cover three 8s, the bid is very reasonable and likely to be true. Challenging now would be risky. To continue, I can either raise the quantity to 4 8s or keep the quantity and increase the digit to 9s. However, I have no 9s, making that less safe. Alternatively, I have three 2s in my hand, so bidding 3 2s keeps the quantity but switches to a digit I am strong in. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I must increase either the quantity or the digit. I will bid 3 9s, as it is the next valid bid (same quantity, next higher digit), and it may put pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand contains no 9s, and with 32 total digits remaining, the expected number of 9s across all hands is ~3.2. However, since I have none, the remaining 24 digits (other players) would statistically average ~2.4 nines. This makes the bid of 3 9s slightly aggressive. Given the prior failed challenge on a similar bid (3 9s had only 2 nines), and the lack of 9s in my hand, challenging seems strategically favorable.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Starting the bidding with 3 6s seems reasonable since I can contribute to the total and it's plausible there's at least one more 6 among the other two players' 16 combined digits. This bid follows the game's progression and leverages my hand's composition.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains one 6, two 7s, two 8s, one 0, one 2, and one 5. The current bid is 3 6s. With only 3 players and 24 total digits, the average count per digit is 2.4. While 3 6s is possible, it's slightly above average. I have one 6. It's plausible one of the other players has two 6s. However, I have two 8s and two 7s, which gives me stronger options for bidding higher. Bidding 4 7s or 4 8s seems more likely to be true based on my hand and the remaining digits.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The bid of 4 8s requires at least two more 8s in the remaining 16 cards, where the expected count is 1.6 and there’s only about a 48% chance of getting ≥2. This bid is unlikely, so I should challenge.
