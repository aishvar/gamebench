Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9, one 5, one 6, and one 8 in my hand, which are relatively high digits. Since there is no current bid, I should start with a moderate bid that reflects my hand and is believable. I will bid 2 6s because I have one 6, and expecting at least two 6s among all players is reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 6s, which aligns exactly with the current bid of 2 6s. Since I can't bid the same quantity with a higher digit, I need to increase the quantity or the digit. The highest possible total for any digit is 8 per player, and with 6 players, the maximum total for any digit is 48. Given I have only 2 sixes, and the total remaining digits are 48, it's unlikely that the total count of 6s across all players exceeds 2. Bidding higher on 6s (like 3 6s) would be risky, as I only have 2 sixes. Bidding on a higher digit (say, 6 7s) is plausible, but I have no 7s. Alternatively, I can challenge the current bid, as it's quite low and the total count of 6s is unlikely to be more than 2. Challenging seems the safest move.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand and the game just started with no bids yet. Starting with a conservative bid of 2 6s is reasonable as it is a low quantity and a digit I hold, making it plausible and a good opening bid to test others.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand. Bidding 3 3s is a valid higher bid than 2 6s and guarantees at least three 3s exist in total, making it a safe and truthful bid. This minimizes risk as any challenge would confirm the bid's validity.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 95439783, which contains two 9s, two 3s, one 5, one 4, one 7, and one 8. The current bid is 3 4s by Player 3. I have one 4 in my hand, so I know at least one 4 exists, but I have no information about the other players' hands. The total number of digits is 40 across 5 players. Bidding higher than 3 4s, I can either increase the quantity to 4 or more of a digit or bid 3 of a higher digit like 5s or above. Given that I have two 9s, bidding 4 9s might be a reasonable escalation, as I contribute two towards the count, and it's plausible that among the remaining 32 digits, there are at least two more 9s. Alternatively, I could challenge, but since 3 4s seems quite low and plausible (only requiring two more 4s from the other 32 digits), challenging feels risky. I'll go with a bid of 4 9s to push the game forward and leverage my strong count of 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. There are 40 total digits, so the expected average quantity for any digit is 4. Thus, 4 9s is a statistically plausible bid. I have zero 9s in my hand (50154355), meaning the other 32 digits held by the remaining 4 players must contain at least four 9s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 9s among those 32 digits is 3.2. While having zero 9s makes the bid slightly less likely from my perspective, 4 is close enough to the expectation that challenging is risky. I need to make a higher bid, which must be at least quantity 5 (e.g., 5 0s). Looking at my hand, I have four 5s. Bidding 5 5s only requires one more 5 among the other 32 digits. The expected number of 5s among those 32 digits is 3.2, making it highly probable that there is at least one more 5. Therefore, bidding 5 5s is a strong and relatively safe bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s, which means there are at least five 5s among all players' digits. I have only one 5 in my hand, so I cannot strongly support this bid. Given there are 40 digits total, having five 5s is plausible but somewhat high. Increasing the bid to 5 6s is possible since I have two 6s, but that might be risky. Alternatively, I could bid 6 0s or higher quantity with any digit, but that might be too aggressive without strong evidence. Challenging might be premature since the bid is reasonable. Therefore, I will raise the bid to 5 6s to stay in the game and apply pressure.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have no 6s in my hand, which suggests the total number of 6s in all hands might be low. Considering the average expected count of 4 for any digit across 40 digits, challenging 5 6s is a calculated risk. With no 6s in my 8 digits, the remaining 32 digits must account for all 5 sixes bid, which is above the average of 4. I'll challenge to test this.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have two 6s and two 8s in my hand. Given the current bid is low and the fact that I have a pair of 8s, I should bid a higher quantity or digit to increase my chances of winning.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 95439783, which contains two 8s. The current bid by Player 3 is 3 8s. Since I have two 8s myself, it's plausible that there is at least one more 8 among the other 24 digits across the remaining players. With a total of 32 digits in play, the likelihood of there being at least 3 8s seems reasonable. Therefore, challenging this bid carries some risk. Instead, I will make a higher bid. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 4 9s feels like a safe increase in both quantity and digit, leveraging my own strong count of 9s while pushing the bid higher to test the other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. There are 32 total digits among 4 players. The expected number of any digit is 3.2. I have zero 9s in my hand (50154355), meaning the other 24 digits must contain at least four 9s for the bid to be true. This is possible, but above the average expectation of 2.4 nines in those 24 digits, making a challenge a consideration. However, my hand contains four 5s. This is a very strong count. Bidding 5 5s requires only one more 5 among the remaining 24 digits held by the other three players. Statistically, it is highly probable (approx. 92%) that at least one 5 exists in those 24 digits. Therefore, leveraging my strong hand by bidding 5 5s is a safer and more assertive move than challenging 4 9s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, and Player 4 previously bid 4 9s, suggesting they may hold additional 9s. Bidding 5 9s (same quantity as the current bid but a higher digit) is a valid and strategic escalation. This leverages my existing 9s and the prior bid to push toward a plausible total count.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Since the current bid is already high, I should aim to increase the digit. Given my hand, bidding 6 9s seems reasonable.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s made by Player 3. In my hand, I have two 9s out of my 8 digits. With 4 active players and a total of 32 digits, the maximum possible number of 9s is 32, but it's unlikely that there are many more 9s beyond what I hold. Previous bids show Player 4 (myself) bid 4 9s and Player 2 bid 5 9s, which suggests some confidence in 9s, but jumping to 6 might be a stretch. However, since I have 2 9s, it's plausible that there could be 4 more across the other 24 digits (about 1 in 6 chance per digit if randomly distributed). Challenging could be risky as I might be underestimating. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid of 7 9s to push the limit and see if others challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s made by Player 4. There are 32 total digits. I have zero 9s in my hand (50154355). This means the other 3 players must collectively hold at least seven 9s among their 24 digits. While the bidding on 9s escalated quickly (Player 4 bid 4 9s, Player 2 bid 5 9s, Player 3 bid 6 9s, Player 4 bid 7 9s), suggesting potential strength or bluffing, requiring 7 out of 24 digits is a high concentration (average is 2.4). Challenging is a possibility. However, my hand contains four 5s. A bid higher than 7 9s would be 8 of any digit. Bidding 8 5s requires only four more 5s among the other 24 digits. Given my four 5s, this is a statistically plausible and strong bid based on my hand. It leverages my known information and puts pressure on the next player. Bidding 8 5s seems safer and more strategically sound than challenging the 7 9s bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid of 8 5s is highly improbable. Statistically, the expected number of 5s in all 32 digits is ~3.2 (32/10). Since I have zero 5s in my hand, all 5s must be distributed among the remaining 24 digits. Requiring 8 5s in total is significantly above the expected distribution and unlikely to be true, making a challenge optimal.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 95439783, which contains two 3s. The current bid is 5 3s by Player 3. With a total of 24 digits across all players, a bid of 5 3s means that there need to be at least 3 more 3s in the other players' hands combined. This is possible but not highly likely given the distribution. However, since I have two 3s, I’ll assume the bid might be close to accurate. Instead of challenging, I’ll make a higher bid. I have three 9s in my hand, so bidding 5 9s feels reasonable as it increases both the digit and maintains the quantity, leveraging my strong count of 9s.
