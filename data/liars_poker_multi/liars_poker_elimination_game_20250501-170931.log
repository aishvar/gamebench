Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am the opening bidder and I hold four 1s in my own hand. With 40 unknown digits among the other five players, the probability that there is at least one additional 1 is very high (about 98%). Starting with a moderate but solid bid that leverages my strong holding while leaving room to maneuver seems prudent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. The current bid is 5 1s, so increasing the quantity to 6 1s is a logical move to challenge the previous bid while leveraging my own 1s. This maintains the same digit but raises the quantity, adhering to the 'higher' rule.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s, and I have the digits 8, 2, 6, 6, 3, 4, 2, 0. Counting the 1s in my hand, I see zero. Since the total number of 1s in all hands must be at least 6 to meet the current bid, and I have no 1s, it's unlikely that the total is 6 or more. Challenging now could be a good move, as the bid seems overestimated given my hand and the total digits remaining.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid of 3 1s, increasing the quantity beyond my own count to set a higher baseline and pressure other players.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Since the total number of digits remaining is 40, it is plausible that there are at least 3 ones. I don't have enough information to confidently challenge. I will make a slightly higher bid. I will bid 4 2s, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have one '2' in my hand. The total digits are 40. Bidding 4 3s is a valid higher bid by increasing the digit with the same quantity. Since I have no 3s, but the bid is not too high, it is a reasonable bid to continue the game without risking a challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have 1 three in my hand. Since I have a three, I can make a valid bid, and I have no reason to challenge. I'll increase the quantity and digit to 4 5s because I have multiple 5s in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:0 - o3-2025-04-16) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold four 1s and zero 5s. Challenging 4 5s is risky since there is roughly a 40% chance that at least four 5s exist among the 32 unseen digits. Instead, I can legally raise the bid by increasing the quantity to 5 and choosing the digit Iâ€™m strongest in. With four 1s already, I only need one more 1 in the remaining 32 digits; the probability of that happening is about 96%. This makes a higher-quantity bid on 1s very safe for me.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. The current bid is 5 1s, which requires at least five 1s in total. Since I have two, and considering other players might have additional 1s, bidding 6 1s increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages the possibility that others may hold more 1s, making the bid reasonable.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. I could bid 7 1s, but that might be risky. I could also bid a higher quantity of a different number. I have two 6s, so bidding 7 1s is probably a safer bet than bidding 7 6s. However, I think bidding 7 1s is the best option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s. I have one '7', two '4's, one '2', and one '9' in my hand, but no '1's. Given there are 40 digits total, 7 occurrences of '1' is plausible but somewhat high. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 7 and increase the digit. Since 7 is already high, increasing quantity to 8 might be risky without any '1's in my hand. Bidding 7 2s is the next valid higher bid, and I have one '2' which supports this. This bid is a safer increment and challenges the previous bidder to justify a higher count of '2's.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 2s. I have two 2s in my hand. Since I have two 2s and the current bid is 7 2s, I should make a higher bid by increasing the quantity or digit. I have no other 2s in my hand, so I can't increase the quantity. However, I do have a 5 in my hand, which is higher than 2. I should bid on the digit 5, which is a safe option.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 7 2s made by Player 4. I can increase the digit to 5, which is higher than the current digit 2, and also increase the quantity to 5, which is the same as the current quantity 7. This seems like a reasonable move.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have a 5 in my hand. Given the total remaining digits is 32, I can safely bid on a high digit with a relatively low quantity. I'll increase the quantity from the current 'None' to 1 and bid on the digit 5.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Challenging 1 5s is almost certain to failâ€”across 32 digits, itâ€™s very likely that at least one 5 exists. Instead, I should raise the bid. Iâ€™m holding four 1s myself, so a bid of 4 1s is guaranteed to be true regardless of what the other players have. This bumps the quantity well above the current bid while keeping my risk essentially zero.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. The current bid is 4 1s, which requires at least four 1s in total. Since I hold two 1s and there are three other players, it's plausible others have additional 1s. Bidding 5 1s increases the quantity, maintaining the digit while raising the stakes. This is a logical progression given the game's history of higher bids.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. It's possible there are at least five 1s in total across all players. I could bid higher, but I'm not confident. I will bid a small increment to stay in the game, but on a different digit. I have two 6s, so I will bid 6 6s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s made by Player 3. I have two 6s in my hand. Given the current bid, I should increase the quantity or digit to make a valid bid. Considering my hand and the current bid, I'll bid 6 7s, as it's a reasonable increase in the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold zero 7s in my eightâ€“digit hand. That leaves 24 unknown digits among the other three players. With a 10% chance for any given digit to be a 7, the expected number of 7s in those 24 digits is about 2â€“3. The probability that there are at least six 7s total (the current bid) is only a few percent. Since Iâ€™m very likely to win a challenge and eliminate Player 5, it is wiser to challenge than to make a riskier higher bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have four 1s. With 16 unseen digits across the other two players, the probability that at least one more 1 is present is well above 80%. Opening with 5 1s makes good use of my strong hand while remaining quite safe against an immediate challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. I could bid 6 2s, or 5 of a higher number. Given that there are only 24 total digits, bidding a very high number of any digit is risky. I'll bid 6 2s.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:0 - o3-2025-04-16) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I can see only one 2 in my own eight digits. For Player 3â€™s bid of 6 2s to be correct, the other 16 hidden digits (held by Players 1 and 3) must contain at least five more 2s. Under a random distribution the expected number of 2s in those 16 digits is 1.6, and the chance of there being 5 or more is under 2%. Even allowing for the fact that both opponents may hold an above-average number of 2s (since they have been bidding on that digit), it is still far more likely than not that the total count is below six. Challenging therefore gives me a strong (>70%) chance to eliminate Player 3, whereas making a higher bid with only one 2 would put me at much greater risk. I should challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. Since the total digits remaining are 16, and Player 0's hand could have at most 8 digits, the actual count of 1s is likely to be 2 (my hand) + x (Player 0's hand). If x is 1 or 0, the total would be 3 or 2, which is less than 4. Challenging risks losing if Player 0 has 2 or more 1s, but given the uncertainty and my own 2 1s, the challenge is a reasonable gamble.
