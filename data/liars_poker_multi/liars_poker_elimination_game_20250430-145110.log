Player 0 Reasoning: Since I am the first to bid and I have two 2s and two 8s, starting with a modest bid of 2 2s is reasonable. It is a safe opening bid that reflects my hand and allows room for future bidding.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s by Player 0, which is a very low bid. I have no 2s in my hand (50979076), but with 6 players and 48 total digits, it's highly likely that at least 2 2s exist across all hands. Since the bid is low, I don't see a reason to challenge it. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 3 7s feels like a reasonable escalation, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains an 8, and the current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid since it maintains the same quantity (3) but increases the digit (7 to 8). This leverages my knowledge of my own hand while adhering to the rules.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 4 8s would be a reasonable bluff, as it's the simplest increase. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have two 4s. Bidding 3 9s is also a possibility, as it increases the digit but isn't necessarily a strong indication of my hand. Given the previous bids and my hand, increasing the quantity of 8s feels like the most natural and potentially successful move. It's a slight increase that could be believed.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand (17991472). For the bid to be true, the other 5 players (40 digits) must have at least four 8s. Statistically, the expected number of 8s among those 40 digits is 4 (40/10). Player 2 bid 3 8s and Player 3 raised to 4 8s, suggesting they might hold 8s, making the bid plausible. Challenging seems risky. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 5 of any digit or 4 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 4 9s requires only two more 9s among the remaining 40 digits. The expected number of 9s in those 40 digits is 4. Therefore, needing only two more makes 4 9s a statistically very safe and likely true bid. It's the minimal possible increase and leverages my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. To raise the bid, I must increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Bidding 5 1s is a valid next bid and reasonable since 1s are likely to appear in the combined hands. Increasing the digit to 1 while keeping the quantity at 5 is a safe and valid move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 50979076, which contains no 1s. The current bid is 5 1s by Player 0. With 48 total digits across 6 players, it's possible that there are 5 or more 1s in play, as each player has 8 digits. However, since I have none, I estimate the likelihood based on average distribution. The expected number of 1s per player is roughly 4.8 (48 digits / 10 possible digits), so 5 1s across all players is plausible but on the lower side. I could challenge, but it's risky as it's not an extreme bid. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. My strongest digits are 0, 7, and 9, each appearing twice in my hand. Bidding on 0s seems reasonable since the previous bid on 0s was 5 by Player 5. I’ll bid 5 2s to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, as it's a safer incremental step.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have zero 3s in my hand. Given the history, players have been bidding relatively high. Increasing the quantity to 6 while keeping the digit at 3 seems reasonable, as it's a valid higher bid. Alternatively, challenging seems viable since I have no 3s, but the game has progressed quite a bit and players might be bluffing effectively. I'll risk a bid to see if I can push the count higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. There are 48 total digits, so the expected number of any digit is 4.8. The bid is slightly higher than average. My hand (17991472) contains zero 3s, which means the other 5 players (40 digits) must have all six 3s. The expected number of 3s among those 40 digits is 4. While Player 2 bid 5 3s and Player 3 raised to 6 3s (suggesting they might hold 3s), requiring 6 from the remaining 40 digits is still above expectation. However, challenging feels risky given the preceding bids. I need to make a higher bid. Possible bids are 6 4s, 6 5s, ..., 6 9s, or 7+ of any digit. I have two 9s in my hand and previously bid 4 9s. Bidding 6 9s is consistent with my previous bid, is supported by my hand (2 out of the required 6), and is only slightly above the statistical average (4.8). This seems like a safer move than challenging or bidding on a digit I have fewer of.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s, made by Player 5. I have two 0s in my hand, which slightly supports the plausibility of this bid. However, 7 zeros out of 48 total digits is not an extraordinarily high count, so it might be reasonable to bid higher. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can either increase the quantity to 8 zeros or keep the quantity at 7 and increase the digit. Increasing the quantity to 8 zeros is a straightforward and strong move, as zeros are somewhat common and I hold two of them. Therefore, I will bid 8 0s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 0s made by Player 0. In my hand, I have two 0s out of my 8 digits. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average number of 0s per player would be around 4.8 if they were evenly distributed, but digits are random. A bid of 8 0s means roughly 17% of all digits are 0s, which is plausible but on the higher side. Given that I only have 2 0s, it's possible that the distribution is uneven and Player 0 is bluffing or overestimating. However, challenging carries a risk since 8 0s is still within a reasonable range. I’ll play it safe and make a higher bid. Since the bid is 8 0s, I can bid 8 1s or higher. I have no 1s in my hand, but bidding 8 1s keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit, which is a minimal escalation and safer than increasing the quantity to 9.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s, which is higher than the average expected count of 4.8 (48 digits / 10 possible digits). My hand contains no 1s, and the previous bids have been relatively conservative. Challenging this bid is reasonable as it may be a bluff, especially since the quantity (8) is close to the maximum possible (48) and the digit (1) is low, making it less likely to have 8 of them across all players.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected average count for any digit is 4. A bid of 3 is statistically likely to be true, making a challenge risky, especially since I have zero 0s myself. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 17991472. I have two 1s, two 7s, and two 9s. Bidding based on my hand is safer. I can bid '3 1s', '3 2s', '3 4s', '3 7s', or '3 9s'. Given I have two 1s, bidding '4 1s' is also a strong possibility, requiring only two more 1s among the remaining 32 digits held by 4 other players. This is statistically likely (expected number is 4 total, so needing 2 more from 32 is reasonable). Bidding 4 1s is a safe increase from 3 0s and is well-supported by my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s, which means the claim is that there are at least five zeros among all players' hands. I have two zeros in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid. The previous bids have been increasing in quantity and digit logically. To continue the bidding, I must raise the bid. The next valid higher bid after 5 0s is either a higher quantity of zeros or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since the current bid is already at 5 zeros, I can bid 6 0s to increase the quantity, which is a reasonable step given I have two zeros and the total digits are 40. Bidding 6 0s is a cautious but valid move that maintains pressure on the next player.

I need to make a higher bid. The next possible bids are 2 0s, 2 1s, ..., 2 9s. I have two 9s in my hand (17991472). Bidding 2 9s is a safe move because I hold two of the required digit myself, making the bid very likely to be true (requiring zero 9s from the other 24 hidden digits).

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s made by Player 3. There are 32 total digits. The expected average for any digit is 3.2. A bid of 5 is above average but plausible, especially since Player 5 bid 3 0s and Player 0 bid 4 0s earlier this round, suggesting some concentration of 0s. Challenging seems risky as I have no 0s, meaning the other 24 digits must contain at least five 0s, which the bidding history supports. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 5 1s through 5 9s, or 6+ of any digit. My hand is 17991472, containing two 1s, two 7s, and two 9s. Bidding 5 1s, 5 7s, or 5 9s is supported by my hand. I previously bid 2 9s this round after Player 3 opened with 1 9s. Continuing with 9s seems consistent and leverages my hand strength.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is None. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 2 9s is a reasonable starting bid, and it's based on a digit I actually possess. It's a conservative bid to start and gauge the other players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s made by Player 3. My hand is 17991472, which contains two 9s. Since I alone possess the quantity bid, the bid of 2 9s is guaranteed to be true. Therefore, challenging is not an option as I would lose. I must make a higher bid. The next possible bids are 3 0s, 3 1s, ..., 3 9s. Given that I have two 9s, bidding 3 9s is a strong possibility. There are 16 unknown digits remaining (held by Player 3 and Player 5). The probability of at least one more 9 among those 16 digits is high (approximately 1 - (0.9)^16 ≈ 81.5%). Bidding 3 9s leverages my hand's strength in that digit and is a statistically reasonable increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. It's possible there are at least three 9s among the 24 total digits, but it's also possible that Player 4 is bluffing. However, I don't have strong evidence to challenge. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity to 4, but I don't have any 0s to use. I will bid 4 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. Player 4 bid 3 9s, and I have two 9s. Bidding 4 9s would be a reasonable increase, but it's risky as it relies on Player 4 also having 9s. Bidding 5 0s is likely too high given my hand and the previous eliminations. Since I have no 0s, challenging the 4 0s bid seems like the best course of action. It's unlikely there are four 0s across the remaining hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is None. I have two 9s in my hand, and Player 4 previously bid 3 9s in the last round. Bidding 4 9s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity. It's a relatively safe bid given my hand and the limited number of digits remaining (16 total, 8 for each player).

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:4 - google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 3. I have two 9s in my hand (17991472). For the current bid to be true, Player 3 needs to have at least two 9s (4 total - 2 in my hand = 2 needed). With 16 total digits, this is plausible. Challenging seems risky because Player 3 only needs two 9s. The next possible bid is 5 0s, or I could raise the quantity on 9s. Since I have two 9s, bidding 5 9s is a strong possibility. This requires Player 3 to have three 9s (5 total - 2 in my hand = 3 needed). Given Player 3 started the bidding with 4 9s, raising to 5 9s puts the pressure back on them and leverages my own holding of two 9s. If Player 3 only has two 9s (making their 4 9s bid correct), they might challenge my 5 9s bid, and I would win. If they have three or more, they'll have to bid higher.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Given that there are only 16 total digits remaining between the two of us, and I only have one 9, it is highly unlikely that there are five 9s in total. Therefore, challenging is the best course of action.
