Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand and expect about four more 2s among the other 40 cards (5 players). Bidding 6 2s is supported by my hand and is about an 80% likely total count, making it a strong opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. I have the digits 90803117, which means I have one 2. With 5 other players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits I don't know. The total count of 2s could be higher than 6, but it's not extremely likely. However, bidding higher than 6 2s is required, so I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. I can bid 6 3s or 7 2s. Since I don't have information about the other players' hands, I'll choose to bid 7 2s as it is a relatively safe increase in quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8. A bid of 7 2s is slightly above average, but not outrageously high, especially early in the game. I have two 3s in my hand, which is a strong indicator for me to bid on 3s. Bidding 7 3s is a valid higher bid and aligns with my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. The highest bid in the previous round was 7 2s, but that player was eliminated. Since there are 40 digits remaining and 5 players, it's reasonable to start with a bid that is higher than the last valid bid but not extremely high. I'll bid 8 2s, increasing the quantity based on the previous round's highest bid and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 94769054, which contains no 2s. The current bid by Player 3 is 8 2s out of a total of 40 digits across 5 players. Given that I have 8 digits and none are 2s, the remaining 32 digits from the other 4 players would need to have at least 8 2s for the bid to hold, which averages to 2 2s per player. While this is statistically possible (since each player has 8 digits, and the expected count per digit per player is 0.8), it feels slightly aggressive as a bid early in the round. However, in the previous round, bids on 2s went up to 7, suggesting there might be a fair number of 2s in play. Since I have no information contradicting this and the bid isn't outrageously high, I’ll avoid challenging and instead make a higher bid. I’ll bid 9 2s to push the quantity up slightly, testing the waters without committing to a much higher number or switching digits, as I have no strong basis for another digit yet.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 2s. I hold two 2s in my hand (05526424). This means the other 32 digits held by the other 4 players must contain at least seven 2s for the bid to be true. The average number of 2s expected across 40 digits is 4. While 9 is significantly higher than average, the previous two bids were 8 2s (Player 3) and 9 2s (Player 4). This escalation suggests Players 3 and 4 might hold a significant number of 2s. If they hold, for example, 3 2s each, combined with my two 2s, that's 8 2s already accounted for among 3 players. Needing only one more 2 from the remaining 16 digits (Players 0 and 1) makes the bid of 9 2s seem plausible. Challenging is therefore risky. Bidding higher on a different digit (like 9 4s or 9 5s, where I also hold two) ignores the bidding momentum on 2s. Bidding 10 2s continues the pressure on the digit already in play. It requires 8 more 2s from the other 32 digits. While this is a high requirement (more than double the average of 3.2 for those 32 digits), it's possible given the previous bids. It forces Player 0 into a difficult decision. Given the context, continuing the bid on 2s seems the most strategically sound, albeit aggressive, move.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. With the other 24 digits, the expected number of 2s is about 2.4 and there’s roughly a 78% chance of at least two more. Opening with 5 2s is a strong but plausible bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have the hand 90803117, which contains one 2. With 32 total digits and 4 players, it's plausible that there are at least 5 twos. However, increasing the quantity or digit is necessary to make a valid bid. I can see that my hand has a distribution that might not strongly support a very high count of 2s, but I can bid higher on a different digit. I will increase the digit to make a higher bid. Bidding 5 3s is a valid move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 2s and one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 5 3s. Since I have no 3s, challenging seems risky. Bidding 6 2s is a reasonable move, increasing the quantity while using a digit I have in my hand. This bid is higher than the current bid of 5 3s because the quantity is higher.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:2 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains no 2s, which means I contribute nothing to the current bid of 6 2s by Player 3. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 6 2s suggests that roughly 19% of the digits are 2s, which is plausible but on the higher side for a single digit. Looking at the bidding history, there has been a pattern of aggressive bidding on 2s in previous rounds, with bids going as high as 10 2s, but those were challenged successfully when the actual count was lower (e.g., 8). However, with fewer players now, the likelihood of 6 2s might still be reasonable. Since I have no 2s, I’m inclined to be skeptical, but I also note that the bid isn’t excessively high compared to total digits. I could challenge, but the risk is significant if the count is indeed 6 or more. Instead, I’ll make a safer bid by increasing the quantity slightly to 7 2s, staying on the same digit, as it’s still within a believable range and avoids an immediate challenge risk while I gauge the other players’ reactions.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have the hand 90803117, which contains one 2 and two 1s, one 3, one 8, and one 9, and one 7, and one 0. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since there are 24 total digits and 3 players, a bid of 4 2s implies that the total count of 2s is at least 4. I can see that I have one 2. To make a higher bid, I can either bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Bidding 5 2s or 4 3s would be valid. Given that I have one 3 in my hand, bidding 4 3s seems reasonable as it increases the digit. However, I should also consider the likelihood of the current bid being true. With 24 total digits, a count of 4 for a specific digit is plausible. Thus, making a slightly higher bid is reasonable.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s made by Player 3. I have the hand 90803117, which contains one 2 (from the digit '2'). With 16 total digits remaining and my hand having one 2, I can infer that there is at least one more 2 in Player 3's hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. My hand has a total of 2 '1's, 1 '0', 1 '8', 1 '3', 1 '9', and 1 '7'. I can see that I have a relatively high count of '1's. I can either bid higher on 2s or switch to a higher digit. Bidding 4 2s seems plausible as it increases the quantity, but I should also consider the distribution. Alternatively, bidding 3 3s is also a valid move as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit. Given my hand has one '3', it's reasonable to believe there could be at least 3 '3's in total. Thus, bidding 3 3s is a strategic move.
