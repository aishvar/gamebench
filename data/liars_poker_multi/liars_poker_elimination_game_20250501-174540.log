Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since it's the first bid, I can bid anything as long as it's a valid bid. I have one 0, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 7, one 8, and one 9 in my hand. Bidding 1 0s seems like a safe and reasonable starting bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (86242771), I don't have any 0s. The current bid is very low at just '1 0s', which means Player 0 is starting conservatively. With 6 players having 8 digits each (48 total digits), it's extremely likely that there's at least one 0 somewhere among all players. Even without any 0s in my hand, I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. I notice I have two 7s in my hand, which gives me some confidence. I could bid on 7s, but I'll start with a modest increase to avoid being too aggressive early in the game. I'll bid '2 1s' since I have one 1 in my hand, and it's reasonable to expect at least one more 1 among the other 40 digits held by other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have two 7s and two 9s in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 1s, I should consider a bid that is more likely to be true or at least not easily challenged. Bidding 2 2s is a valid move as it increases the digit. However, considering my hand and the fact that I have no information about other players' hands, I should start with a conservative bid. Thus, bidding 2 2s seems reasonable.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 2 3s is a valid higher bid than the current 2 2s (same quantity, higher digit). Since I have two of this digit, the total count across all players is guaranteed to be at least 2, making this a safe bid that cannot be invalidated if challenged later.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 2 3s. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable increase, as it raises both the quantity and the digit.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, so increasing the quantity to 4 6s is a logical next step, as it's strictly higher and leverages the digit I know exists in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 5 6s would be a reasonable bluff, as it's a small increase in quantity and I have a 6. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have one 0, two 2s, one 3, one 5, one 7, one 8, and one 9. Bidding 2 7s is a possible option, but 5 6s seems more plausible given the previous bids focusing on 6s. Since I have a 6, I will bid 5 6s.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:0 - claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. In my hand, I have 86242771, which contains no 6s. The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 0. Given that Player 5 previously bid 4 6s, they likely have at least one 6. Player 0 then increased this to 5 6s, suggesting they might have at least one 6 as well. With 6 players having 8 digits each (48 total), it's plausible that there are 5 or more 6s in total. However, since I have zero 6s in my hand, and two players have already indicated they might have 6s, I think 5 6s is a reasonable estimate. I should either bid higher or challenge. To bid higher, I could bid 5 7s (same quantity, higher digit) or 6 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, which gives me some confidence to bid 5 7s. This seems safer than challenging or making a higher quantity bid without evidence.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have two 7s in my hand (00946797). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have two 7s, it's likely that the total count of 7s is at least 5 or more considering there are 5 other players. However, bidding more than 7 7s might be too high because that would imply every other player has at least one 7. I can bid 5 8s, increasing the digit. This seems reasonable as it is a higher bid and doesn't overly inflate the count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have no 8s in my hand, which reduces the expected total 8s in all hands. With 48 total digits, the expected number of 8s is ~4.8, but since I have none, the remaining 40 digits likely contain ~4.0 8s. A bid of 5 is above this adjusted expectation, making it statistically unlikely. Challenging is favorable.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. With 40 total digits remaining across five players, the statistical expectation for any digit (including 9s) is around 4. Bidding 3 9s is conservative but reasonable, as it only requires one additional 9 in other players' hands to meet the bid. Starting with a high digit like 9 also limits opponents' options to raise further.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Given that there are 40 digits remaining and 5 players, it's possible that there could be 3 9s, but unlikely that there are more. Challenging seems risky, but bidding higher is also uncertain. I have two 5s in my hand, so I'll bid 4 5s, increasing the digit and slightly increasing the quantity.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, but the current bid is 4 5s. Bidding 4 6s is a valid higher bid since it maintains the same quantity (4) but increases the digit (6 > 5). I have a 6 in my hand, making this a reasonable claim. Challenging risks losing if the actual count of 5s is â‰¥4, which is plausible given my two 5s and potential others' hands.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Player 5 bid 4 6s, and I previously bid 5 6s, but that was challenged and I lost. Now, the current bid is again 4 6s. Bidding 5 6s again is risky as it's already been challenged once. I have a 9 in my hand, so I can bid 4 9s, which is a valid higher bid than 4 6s. Alternatively, I can challenge, but 4 6s seems plausible given 5 players each having 8 digits. I'll go with the safer bid of 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (86242771), I don't have any 9s. Player 0 has bid 4 9s, which means they believe there are at least 4 nines among all 40 digits. With 5 players having 8 digits each, that's not an unreasonable claim. Even without any 9s in my hand, the other 4 players could easily have 4 or more 9s between them. I should make a higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, which gives me some confidence. I could bid 5 0s, 5 1s, 5 2s, etc., or I could bid 4 with a higher digit than 9, which isn't possible since 9 is the highest digit. So I'll have to increase the quantity to 5. Since I have two 7s in my hand, I'll bid 5 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid of 5 7s requires at least five 7s across all five players' hands. I have one 7 in my hand. Assuming other players' digits are distributed randomly, the expected number of 7s in the remaining 32 digits is approximately 3.2, leading to a total of ~4.2 including mine. This suggests the bid is likely false. Additionally, a previous challenge on a similar bid (5 8s) succeeded, indicating bids of 5 may often be over the actual count.

Player 3 Reasoning: Starting the round with a bid based on my two 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s leverages my high digits and forces subsequent bidders to increase the quantity, as 9 is the highest digit. With 24 total digits across three players, having at least three 9s is plausible (I have two, and one more elsewhere would validate the bid). Starting with a high digit and moderate quantity applies pressure on opponents.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, but the total count across all players could be as low as 1 (if others have none). Since the bid requires at least 3, challenging is a reasonable risk. The previous challenges eliminated players, suggesting others might be bluffing. If the actual count is less than 3, I win; otherwise, I lose. Given the uncertainty, challenging is strategic.
