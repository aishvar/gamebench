Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since no bids have been made yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 2 9s is a reasonable starting point.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. My hand contains two 1s, and increasing the quantity to 3 while selecting a digit from my hand (1) ensures a valid higher bid. This maintains a logical progression while leveraging my known card distribution.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I don't have any 1s in my hand. I could bid 3 of a higher number, or increase the quantity. I'll play it safe and bid 4 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have one 2 in my hand, so I cannot bid 4 2s or higher on the same digit. Bidding a higher digit with the same quantity (e.g., 4 3s) is unlikely since I have only one 3, and others might have more. The highest plausible bid I can make is 4 2s, but it's not valid to repeat or lower the bid. Since I cannot make a higher bid on 2s and I lack enough 2s to raise the quantity, my best move is to challenge, assuming the previous bid is unlikely to be accurate.

Player 3 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made in this round, I can start the bidding. I have a 6 and an 8 in my hand, and I want to make a reasonable opening bid that is unlikely to be challenged immediately. Bidding 2 8s seems safe, as I have one 8, and it's unlikely that the total count of 8s across all players is less than 2. This sets a low but valid bid to continue the game.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable increase, as it increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same. It's a relatively safe bid given my hand, and doesn't reveal too much information about my other digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that there are 40 digits remaining and 5 players, it's plausible that there could be 3 or 4 8s in total. However, bidding higher on 8s is risky. Instead, I should consider bidding on a digit I have more of. I have two 7s, so bidding 4 7s is a reasonable move, increasing both the quantity and the digit from the last bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s, which means there are at least 3 more 7s among the other 4 players (32 digits). Given that 7s are not extremely common and the previous bid was 3 8s, it's plausible that the total count of 7s is close to 4. However, with only one 7 in my hand, I'm skeptical that there are three more among the other players. Challenging seems like the safer option.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since the current bid is None and I'm the first to bid in this round, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 2 9s is reasonable given my hand and doesn't overcommit.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 1s. The current bid is 2 9s, which can be challenged, but I have a stronger basis to bid higher. Bidding 3 1s increases the quantity, making it a valid higher bid based on my hand's composition.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:2 - gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. Given my hand (6,8,4,1,3,5,4,0), I have one '1'. The total number of '1's across all players is likely around 4, since Player 1 bid 3 1s and I have only one '1'. Challenging the bid seems risky because the count could realistically be 3 or more, especially with other players' unseen hands. Bidding higher on 1s would require at least 4 '1's, which I don't have. The next logical bid would be 4 1s, but I lack enough '1's to confidently bid that. Alternatively, I could challenge, but the risk of losing is significant if the total is indeed 3 or more. Given the information, the safest move is to challenge, as the count of '1's is unlikely to reach 4.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid of 2 1s is a truthful and logical move based on my hand. This sets a baseline for others to challenge or bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Bidding 3 1s is a reasonable increase, as it's a higher quantity of the same digit. Alternatively, I could bid on another digit I have, but 1s seem to be appearing frequently given the previous rounds. Increasing the quantity of 1s is the safest option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one '1' in my hand. The current bid is 3 '1's, made by Player 4. With only 24 digits remaining and three players, it's possible that there are at least three '1's in total, but it's a close call. Given that Player 1 bid 2 '1's before Player 4 increased it to 3, and considering the previous round where the actual count was 5 '1's, it's plausible that the current bid is valid. However, the risk is high, and I don't have strong evidence to challenge. I'll make a conservative bid to keep the game going.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one '2'. The current bid is 3 2s, which requires at least three 2s across all players. Since I have one 2 and there are two other players, it's possible the total is exactly 3. However, bidding 4 2s increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages the possibility that other players may hold additional 2s, making the bid reasonable without challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have zero 2s in my hand. Given the history of challenges succeeding when bids seem high, and knowing I have no 2s, challenging seems like the best option. The previous challenges have shown players are willing to challenge when they suspect a bluff, and I have strong reason to believe this bid is a bluff.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None'. I have two 8s and one 4 in my hand. Bidding 2 9s is a safe and reasonable opening bid, as it's higher than the previous rounds' bids and doesn't reveal too much information about my hand. It's also a digit that hasn't been heavily bid on recently.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand (61899379). The current bid is 2 9s. Since I already have more than the bid quantity in my own hand, it's likely that the total count is higher. I should increase the bid to 3 9s to reflect my confidence based on my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand (61899379). The current bid is 4 9s by Player 4. Given that there are only 16 digits in total, and I already have two 9s, it's possible that Player 4 also has two 9s, making the total 4. However, the probability of exactly 4 is uncertain, and bidding higher would require a total of 5 or more 9s, which seems risky. Therefore, challenging the bid is a safer option.
