Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid, and there is no current bid to beat. I have three 7s and two 5s in my hand. With 6 players each having 8 digits, there are 48 total digits. On average, there should be around 4-5 of each digit (48 / 10 = 4.8). Bidding 3 7s is a safe starting bid based on my hand and the average distribution.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected average count for any digit is 4.8. A bid of 3 is relatively low and plausible, making a challenge risky this early. My hand is 92693189. I have zero 7s, but I have three 9s. Bidding based on the strength of my hand is a standard strategy. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit), is still a low quantity, and is strongly supported by the three 9s I personally hold. This seems like a safe and informative bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which means there must be at least three 9s among all 48 digits. Since I already have two, it's quite plausible that at least one more exists among the remaining 40 digits (held by 5 other players). Therefore, challenging now is risky. I should make a higher bid. I also have two 0s, so I can safely bid 3 0s, but since the digit must be higher or the quantity must increase, I can instead bid 4 0s, increasing the quantity and selecting a digit I have a good count of in my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have four 4s in my hand. Raising to 4 4s is a minimal valid increase over 4 0s (same quantity but higher digit) and guaranteed true based on my cards.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s, meaning at least four 4s exist among all players. I have one 4 in my hand, which supports the plausibility of this bid. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 but increase the digit. Increasing the digit to 5 while keeping the quantity at 4 is a reasonable step, as 4 5s is a higher bid. Given the total of 48 digits, this bid is plausible and keeps the game moving.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. For the bid 4 7s to be true, only two more 7s are needed among the 40 unseen digits. With each digit having roughly a 10% chance, the expected number of 7s in those 40 digits is about 4, so the probability that at least two appear is well over 90%. This makes 4 7s a safe, strictly higher bid than the current 4 5s (same quantity, higher digit).

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8. The current bid of 4 7s is exactly the average. Since I hold three 7s, it's very likely there are at least four 7s in total. It's also possible there are five 7s, which would be a safe bid. Challenging 4 7s is risky given my hand. Bidding 5 7s is a reasonable increase based on my hand and the probability.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. There are 48 total digits (6 players * 8 digits). The expected number of any digit is 4.8. I have zero 7s in my hand (92693189). This slightly lowers the probability of five 7s existing, but Player 0 and Player 5 have both bid on 7s (3 7s, 4 7s, now 5 7s), suggesting they may hold some. Challenging seems risky as only 5 are needed total, and the expected number among the other 40 digits is 4. A higher bid is required. My hand contains three 9s. Bidding based on my strong suit is logical. Possible higher bids are 5 8s, 5 9s, or quantity 6 bids. Bidding 5 9s is safe (I have 3, need 2 more from 40, expected 4). Bidding 6 9s is also statistically plausible (I have 3, need 3 more from 40, expected 4). Given my strong hand in 9s and my previous bid of 3 9s, escalating to 6 9s is a strong move that leverages my hand information and puts pressure on subsequent players.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. In my hand (18760039), I have two 9s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits total. On average, each digit appears about 4.8 times, so 6 of any digit is a slightly aggressive but plausible bid. Since I have two 9s, there need to be at least 4 more 9s among the other 40 digits. This is possible, but not certain. Challenging now would be risky, as it's not extremely unlikely. Instead, I should make a higher bid. The minimal valid higher bid is 7 0s, since I have two 0s. While I don't have a huge number of 0s, this bid is not much riskier than the current one and keeps me in the game.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have four 4s in my hand and no zeros. The current bid of 7 zeros is unlikely given I hold none. Switching to 4s leverages my strong holding: with four 4s and an expected four more among the other 40 digits, bidding 7 4s is plausible. The next valid bid is same quantity but higher digit, so I will bid 7 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 4s, which means there are at least seven 4s among all players' digits. I have one '4' in my hand. Given that there are 48 digits total, having seven 4s is plausible but somewhat high. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity above 7 or keep the quantity at 7 and increase the digit above 4. The next valid bid after 7 4s could be 7 5s or 8 0s. I have one '5' in my hand, which supports bidding 7 5s. Increasing the quantity to 8 is riskier without more of that digit in my hand. Therefore, bidding 7 5s is a reasonable and safer move.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have zero 5s in my eight-digit hand. That means every one of the claimed seven 5s would have to come from the other 40 unseen digits, where the expected count of any single digit is only about four. Even if Player 4 holds several 5s, the chance that the table reaches seven is still well below 50%. Challenging is the best move.

Player 5 Reasoning: I start the round, so I need to place the initial bid. I hold one 9. With 40 total digits in play, the average count of any given digit is about 4, and the probability that there are at least two more 9s among the other 32 hidden digits is close to 87%. A bid of 3 9s is therefore very safe for me while also forcing the next bidder to increase the quantity, since 9 is already the highest digit.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. A bid of 3 9s is below average and plausible, but given I have no 9s, it's less likely to be true. However, challenging a bid of 3 9s when the average is 4 is risky. I have three 7s in my hand. Bidding 4 7s is a safe and reasonable increase over 3 9s, using a digit I know I have a significant count of.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. The expected number of any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. I have zero 7s in my hand (92693189). For the bid to be true, there must be at least 4 7s among the other 32 digits. The expected number of 7s in those 32 digits is 3.2. While 4 7s is slightly above the expectation for the remaining hands, it equals the overall average, making a challenge risky. My hand contains three 9s. A bid of 4 9s would be very safe (only needing one more 9 from 32 digits), but only increases the digit. A bid of 5 9s requires only two more 9s from the other 32 digits. Given the expected number of 9s in those digits is 3.2, and Player 5 previously bid 3 9s (suggesting they might hold some), bidding 5 9s is statistically well-supported and leverages my strong hand while increasing the quantity significantly.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 18760039, which contains two 9s. The current bid is 5 9s, meaning at least five 9s among all 40 digits. With five players, there are 40 digits in play. I hold two 9s myself. Statistically, each digit appears about 4 times (40/10), so 5 9s is slightly above average, but not unreasonable. Since I have two of them, it's plausible that three more 9s exist among the other 32 digits. It's risky to challenge, so it's better to make a higher bid. The next legal bid is either 6 0s or 5 of a higher digit (which is not possible since 9 is the highest). I have two 0s in my hand, so I will bid 6 0s, leveraging my strong holding in zeros.

Player 5 Reasoning: I only have one 4, so challenging the opening bid of 5 4s would be close to a coin-flip—Player 3 likely has several 4s since they started the round with that bid. Rather than risk elimination on such slim odds, I’ll overbid by keeping the quantity the same and raising the digit. I hold two 7s, and Player 0 has shown a preference for 7s in earlier rounds, implying more 7s may be in play. Needing just three additional 7s among the remaining 24 unseen digits is quite plausible and should make an immediate challenge less attractive. I’ll therefore bid 5 7s.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. The current bid is 5 7s. With 4 players and 32 total digits, the average count per digit is 3.2.  Having three 7s myself makes the bid of 5 7s plausible, but it's still a bit high based on probability (3 + average of 3 players' hands). However, challenging 5 7s with three 7s in my hand is risky if there are two or more 7s among the other three players.  Bidding 6 7s is a slight increase and aligns with my strong hand in 7s.  Bidding a higher quantity of a different digit is less appealing given my hand composition. Bidding 6 7s is a safer bet than challenging or bidding a different digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have zero 7s in my hand (92693189). This means the remaining 24 digits held by the other 3 players must contain at least six 7s (6/24 = 25%). While Player 0 and Player 5 have bid 7s previously, suggesting they might hold some, requiring 25% of the remaining digits to be 7s seems unlikely. However, challenging is risky as they might indeed hold many 7s. A safer option is to make a higher bid based on my hand. I hold three 9s. Bidding 6 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires only three additional 9s among the other 24 digits (3/24 = 12.5%), which is statistically much more plausible than 6 7s. This leverages my strong hand in 9s and puts pressure on the next player without taking an extreme risk.

Unless Player 3 happens to hold an unusually large number of 4s—a rare scenario—the bid is likely false.
