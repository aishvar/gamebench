Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With 48 total digits and an expected ~4.8 sixes overall, bidding 5 sixes is a reasonable opening bid that leverages my extra two to just exceed the average.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits remaining, the expected number of 6s is 4.8, making 5 6s a plausible bid. Challenging carries risk. My hand contains three 4s (a strong holding). Bidding on a digit where I have multiple is a good strategy. A bid of 6 4s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity than 5 6s) and is well-supported by my hand; I have 3 fours, meaning only 3 more are needed from the remaining 40 digits across 5 players, which is likely (expected count is 4). This seems like the most reasonable and supported bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. With 40 remaining digits across 5 players, expecting 5 more 4s (total 6) is statistically unlikely (expected ~4). Challenging this bid offers a reasonable chance of success if the count is less than 6.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round, so I must make a bid. My hand is 42314046, which contains three 4s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 4. My hand is significantly stronger than average for the digit 4. The previous round also revealed a high count of 4s (8 out of 48 digits). Bidding 5 4s is a strong starting bid that leverages my hand strength and is credible, as the expected total count of 4s is around 6.2 (my 3 plus 3.2 expected from the remaining 32 digits).

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have the digits 60925809, which includes one 4 (from the digit 9, there are no 4s, my count is 0). Given that I have 0 fours, the total count of 4s across all 5 players must be at least 5 for the bid to be valid. With 40 total digits and 5 players, it's possible that the other players have a significant number of 4s. However, I can bid higher than 5 4s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I can bid 6 4s or 5 5s. Since I have two 5s and two 6s and no 4s or higher digits in abundance, I should consider a bid that is reasonable based on my hand and the information available. Bidding 5 5s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and I have some 5s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid of 5 5s likely exceeds the actual count. With only one 5 in my hand and an expected total of ~4.2 5s across all players (based on uniform distribution), the bid is probably invalid. Challenging is a calculated risk with favorable odds.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Since the bid is quite low and 7 is a mid-range digit, it is reasonable to increase the bid. The next valid higher bid could be either 4 8s or 5 0s. I will bid 4 8s, as it is the smallest increment and still plausible.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand. There are 24 unknown digits and even at a 10% chance per digit the expected number of 8s among them is only 2.4, with under a 25% chance of reaching 4. A bid of 4 8s is unlikely, so I will challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand and expect about 1.6 more among the other 16 cards, making at least three 6s likely. Opening with 3 6s is a reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. My hand contains one 6. Challenging 3 6s would mean I believe the other two players combined have zero or one 6, which seems risky given 16 unknown digits. My hand is strong in 4s, containing three of them. Bidding 4 4s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity than 3 6s) and is well-supported by my hand, requiring only one additional 4 from the other two players. This is a much safer and more strategic move than challenging or bidding on a digit I have few of.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand (1,4,3,7,3,7,5,7), which strongly supports a bid of at least 4 7s. Bidding 4 7s is a valid higher bid than 4 4s (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages my strong holdings in 7s. Challenging 4 4s carries risk since Player 1's bid could be supported by their own 4s, while my hand provides one confirmed 4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. To meet the bid of 4 7s, there must be 3 more 7s among the 16 unknown digits. The probability of that is only about 20%, so the current bid is very likely a bluff. I should challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. Bidding 4 7s seems reasonable since the total count could reach 4 if Player 1 has at least one 7. This follows the pattern of aggressive bidding seen in previous examples, leveraging the likelihood that Player 1 holds at least one additional 7 to support the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 4. There are 16 total digits remaining (8 in my hand, 8 in Player 4's). My hand contains zero 7s. For the bid of 4 7s to be true, Player 4 must have at least four 7s in their 8 digits. The probability of a player having 4 or more of a specific digit in 8 random digits is very low (Binomial(8, 0.1) P(X>=4) is approximately 0.5%). Given this extremely low probability, challenging the bid is the statistically favored move. Although Player 4 successfully bid 4 7s in the previous round, the current situation (fewer total digits, my known lack of 7s) makes the bid highly improbable.
