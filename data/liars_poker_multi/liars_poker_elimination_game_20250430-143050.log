Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With 48 total digits and uniform distribution, we expect about 4.8 sixes overall. Bidding three 6s is a safe opener, leveraging what I hold while staying conservative.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (04725138), so I know at least one 6 exists among my digits. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since I have information about my own hand, I'll analyze it: my digits are 0, 4, 7, 2, 5, 1, 3, 8. I see one 6 and no higher digits are present in significant amounts to confidently bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Thus, I'll increase the quantity. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it is a higher quantity than the current bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand. The average expected count for 6s across all players is ~4.8, making the current bid of 4 6s plausible. Instead of challenging, I raise to 4 7s based on having two 7s in my hand, which makes 4 7s likely above average.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. To raise the bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Bidding 4 8s is the next valid bid and seems reasonable since I have one 8 in my hand and the total digits are 48, making 4 8s plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 5 8s would be a reasonable increase in quantity, and is likely achievable given the total number of digits remaining. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit, but 8s seems most promising given my hand. Increasing the digit would require me to believe other players also have that digit, which is less certain.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4.8. The bid of 5 8s is slightly above average, but not excessively so, especially considering the previous bids have been increasing steadily.  I have two 0s, one 2, two 3s, one 4, one 6, and one 8. I can make a higher bid. Bidding 6 0s or 6 3s are possibilities based on my hand, increasing the quantity. Bidding 5 9s is also an option, increasing the digit. Bidding 6 0s seems reasonable as I have two 0s and it's a safe increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Challenging 6 zeros is risky since expected zeros ~5.7 and I hold one. I hold two 1s and expect ~2.8 more in others (total ~4.8), so claiming 6 ones (needing 4 others) is quite plausible (~70% chance) and is the smallest valid raise over 6 zeros.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Given that there are 48 total digits and 6 players, a bid of 6 1s implies an average of 1 '1' per player. Since I have one 1, it's plausible others have at least one as well. However, increasing the quantity to 7 seems reasonable if I believe others might have 1s. I will bid 7 1s as it's a conservative increase.

Player 2 Reasoning: The average expected count for any digit in 48 total digits is approximately 4.8. With only one 1 in my hand, statistical probability suggests the total number of 1s across all hands is unlikely to reach 7. Challenging the current bid of 7 1s aligns with this probabilistic reasoning.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. Bidding 4 2s is reasonable as it's plausible other players have at least one more 2, considering the average expected count across 40 total digits. This bid starts the round with a moderate but defensible claim.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s, which means at least four 2s exist among all players' hands. I have two 2s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of this bid. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity same and increase the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 0s is an option, but I have no zeros in my hand, making it riskier. Increasing the digit while keeping the quantity at 4 is safer. I have one 4 in my hand, so bidding 4 3s (digit 3 is higher than 2) is possible, but I have no 3s. I have one 5, which is higher than 2, so bidding 4 5s is a reasonable next step, as it is higher than 4 2s and supported somewhat by my hand, making it a safer bid than challenging now.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Player 3 bid 4 5s. I have zero 5s in my hand. Given the history of challenges and eliminations, and the relatively low total digit count (40), a bid of 4 5s feels high. While I don't have information about other players' hands, it's reasonable to challenge this bid, as it's unlikely there are 4 or more 5s among the remaining 40 digits. A higher bid would require me to bluff significantly, and challenging seems more strategic given my hand and the current game state.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: It's the start of a new round with 32 total digits remaining and 4 players. The previous bids were relatively conservative after the challenges. I have two 6s, two 8s, one 0, and two 4s. Considering the current state, bidding 1 8s is a safe starting point. It's a low bid, but it establishes a baseline and doesn't reveal too much about my hand. It's higher than the initial bid of 'None'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 08402363. I have one 8 and two 0s. The current bid is 1 8s. Since I have an 8, I know the bid is valid. However, bidding 2 8s would only increase the quantity by one. With two 0s, bidding on 0s seems like a stronger move. A bid of 2 0s is a valid increase over 1 8s (same quantity, higher digit). Given I have two 0s, bidding 2 0s is conservative and likely safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have only one 0 but two 1s. Challenging 2 0s is risky since the other 24 unknown digits likely include at least one more zero. Instead, I can safely raise to 2 1s (same quantity, higher digit) and I hold two 1s, so I would win any challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand, but the current bid of 2 1s requires at least one more 1 among the other three players. With 24 digits across the remaining three players, the probability of no additional 1s is low (~8%). Challenging risks elimination. Instead, bidding 2 2s leverages my three 2s (ensuring the total meets the bid) and follows the bid hierarchy (same quantity, higher digit).

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have no 2s in my hand, making it plausible that the bid is a bluff. However, given the previous rounds and the remaining digits (32), it's not extremely unlikely. I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s would be a reasonable increase and leverage my hand. Alternatively, I could bid 3 0s, but I only have one 0. Bidding 3 1s is also possible, as I have one 1. Since 3 8s is the strongest bid I can make based on my hand, I will go with that.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 08402363. I have one 8. The current bid is 3 8s. With 32 total digits, the expected number of 8s is around 3.2 (32 / 10). Player 4, who made the bid, might have multiple 8s. However, bidding 3 8s is close to the expected value. I have two 0s, one 2, one 3, one 4, and one 6. I can make a bid higher than 3 8s. Bidding 4 0s seems reasonable as I have two 0s, and it's a valid higher bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 1s and with 24 unknown digits there should be about 2–3 more 1s, making a total of roughly 4–5. Bidding 4 1s is a minimal raise over 4 0s and remains plausible given my hand and expected distribution.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. My hand contains one '1', leaving 24 digits across three opponents. The average expected count for any digit in 32 total digits is 3.2, making 4 1s slightly above average. Given Player 0's bid of 4 1s and limited signaling in recent bids, it is plausible the actual count is below 4. Challenging this bid is a calculated risk based on statistical likelihood and my own hand composition.

A bid of 3 6s is slightly above average but not unreasonable. I could bid 4 0s since I have two 0s, but bidding on 6s seems safer as I know there is at least one more 6 out there (Player 0 bid 2 6s previously, and Player 4 bid 3 6s).

A bid of 3 0s is slightly above average. Given I have two 0s, it's possible Player 4 has at least one 0. However, I can make a higher bid. I have two 3s. Bidding 3 3s would be a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Bidding 4 0s is also a valid higher bid (higher quantity, same digit) and I have two 0s, so it's plausible there are at least two more between Player 4 and me. Bidding 4 0s seems like a reasonable next step based on my hand and the current bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Player 5 has already bid 2 and 4 0s, and I previously bid 3 0s. Given the limited number of digits remaining (16 total, 8 for each player), and the history of successful bids around this quantity, bidding 5 0s seems risky. However, I can bid 4 1s, as I have two 1s. This increases the digit while matching the quantity of the previous bid. Alternatively, I could challenge, but Player 5 seems confident and has made successful bids on 0s previously. Therefore, I will bid 4 1s.

With only 16 total digits, 4 1s is a significant bid, representing 25% of the remaining digits. While possible, it feels slightly high given I have none. Bidding higher on a digit I have, like 4 3s or 4 0s, is not a valid higher bid. Bidding 5 of any digit feels too risky. Challenging feels like the most prudent move given my lack of 1s and the relative strength of the bid.
