Player 0 Reasoning: As the starting player, there is no current bid, so I must make the opening bid. My hand contains three 1s, two 5s, two 0s, and one 3. It's reasonable to start with a conservative opening bid based on my hand. I'll bid 3 1s, since I hold three 1s myself, making it a safe and credible opening bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 1, increasing the quantity seems risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding a higher digit with a low quantity could be a strategy. I have a 9 in my hand, and bidding 1 9s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s made by Player 0. I have one 1 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my goal is to make a reasonable bid, I will increase the quantity and bid on a digit that seems plausible given my hand and the total digits remaining.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected number of 1s is around 48/10 = 4.8. The current bid is close to the expected value. However, I have two 2s, two 7s, and two 8s. I can make a bid based on one of these digits. Bidding 5 2s is a valid higher bid based on my two 2s. Bidding 5 7s or 5 8s are also options. 5 2s seems reasonable as it's a direct increase in quantity over the current bid of 4 1s, and I have two of them.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. There are 48 total digits, so the expected average for any digit is 4.8. The bid of 5 is slightly above average. I have zero 2s in my hand (49610303), which slightly lowers the probability of the bid being true, but doesn't make it impossible (5 2s needed from the other 40 digits is plausible). Challenging seems risky this early. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 0s and two 3s. Bidding based on my own digits is safer. A bid of 5 3s is a valid increase (same quantity, higher digit). With two 3s myself, needing only three more 3s from the remaining 40 digits (where the expected number is 4) makes this a statistically reasonable and relatively safe bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have the digits 3, 8, 9, 5, 2, 5, 3, 9 in my hand, which includes two 3s. Given that only 48 total digits are in play, and the previous bid is 5 3s, it is unlikely that there are at least 6 3s across all players' hands. Challenging the bid seems safe and justified based on the low count of 3s I hold and the total digits remaining.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I am Player 3 and I start the bidding this round. The current bid is 'None', so I must make a bid. I have 8 digits: 49610303. This includes two 0s and two 3s. With 5 active players and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. The expected number of any specific digit is 40 / 10 = 4. Since I have two 0s, the expected total number of 0s across all hands is 2 (my hand) + (32 other digits / 10) = 2 + 3.2 = 5.2. Similarly, the expected number of 3s is 5.2. An opening bid should be relatively safe but establish a baseline. Bidding '4 0s' is a solid choice: it's based on one of my strongest digits (0s), it's below the statistically expected total count (5.2), and bidding on the lowest digit (0) leaves maximum room for future bids.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 4 0s, which seems plausible given the previous round's high counts. Since I have one 0, and the bid is not excessively high, I will make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 1s, which I also have one of in my hand. This keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 11312550, so I have three 1s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits total. The current bid is 4 1s. Statistically, each digit should appear about 4 times (40/10). Since I alone have three 1s, it's highly likely there are at least 4 1s among all hands, making the bid plausible. To make a strictly higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. I don't have many of any other digit, but I do have two 0s and two 5s, so raising to 4 2s or 4 5s would be risky. The safest next bid is 4 2s, since I also have one 2, and it's a minimal increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s made by Player 0. I have 8 secret digits: 9, 6, 5, 4, 0, 3, 2, 6. I see that I have two 6s and one 2. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40 and there are 40 total digits remaining, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. I will bid 5 2s as it is a higher quantity than the current bid and I have one 2 in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains two 2s. The current bid is 5 2s. With 40 total digits and 5 players, the average occurrence of any digit is 4 (40 / 10 digits). A bid of 5 2s is slightly above average but not unreasonable, especially considering Player 1 might have several 2s. I have two 2s, so if Player 1 has three or more, the bid is met. Increasing the bid to 6 2s seems plausible given my hand, and it's a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. The expected number of any digit is 4. I have zero 2s in my hand (49610303). This means the other 4 players (32 digits) must hold at least six 2s. While 6 is above the average of 4, the bidding history shows three consecutive players bidding on 2s (Player 0: 4 2s, Player 1: 5 2s, Player 2: 6 2s), suggesting a potential concentration of 2s among them. Challenging seems risky due to this pattern. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 6 3s or higher, or 7 0s or higher. My hand contains two 0s and two 3s. Bidding 6 3s requires four 3s among the other 32 digits (expected value is 3.2), which is plausible. I have two 3s to support this bid. Bidding 7 0s would require five 0s among the other 32 digits, which is less likely than needing four 3s. Bidding 6 3s is a minimal increase from 6 2s and is well-supported by my hand. Additionally, I successfully defended a bid of 5 3s in the previous round (actual count was 6), which might make others hesitant to challenge my 3s bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 6 3s, which is already quite high. With 5 players remaining and each having 8 digits, the total digits are 40. The previous challenge on 5 3s revealed there were actually 6 3s, but now the bid is 6 3s again. Given that, and considering the risk, I think it's better to challenge this bid rather than make a higher bid that might be too risky.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 1, one 5, one 8, one 0, one 4, one 7, and two 8s in my hand. Since the current bid is None and I'm the first to bid in this round, I should make a conservative bid based on my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 11312550, which contains no 8s. The current bid is only 2 8s, and since there are 24 unknown digits among the other 3 players, it's quite plausible that there are at least 2 eights among all hands. Challenging now is risky. The safest move is to make a minimal higher bid. I have three 1s in my hand, so bidding 2 9s (the next legal bid) would be arbitrary, but bidding 3 1s leverages my hand's strength and is a safe incremental raise.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s made by Player 0. I have one 1 in my hand. Given that there are 4 active players and each has 8 secret digits, there are a total of 32 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. Since I have one 1, and assuming the other players might have some 1s as well, bidding 4 1s seems reasonable and higher than the current bid. However, I should also consider the likelihood of there being at least 4 1s in total. Alternatively, I could challenge if I think 3 1s is unlikely, but given my 1 and the total possible digits, bidding seems safer.

A bid of 4 1s is slightly above average but not unreasonable, especially since Player 0 and Player 1 both bid on 1s. I have two 2s, two 7s, and two 8s. Bidding on one of these digits seems like a good strategy as I have above-average counts of them.  Bidding 5 2s is a valid higher bid and I have two 2s to support it.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 11312550, which contains three 1s. The current bid is 4 1s, meaning there must be at least one more 1 in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. With 8 digits per player and only two players left, it's plausible Player 1 has at least one 1, but not guaranteed. However, since I have three 1s myself, it's risky for Player 1 to bid 4 1s unless they have at least one or two 1s. Given the history, Player 1 may be bluffing, but the odds are not overwhelmingly against the bid. Instead of challenging, I can safely raise to 4 2s, since I have two 2s in my hand, making it possible that there are two more in Player 1's hand. This keeps the pressure on and gives me more information.
