Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With 40 unknown digits among the other players, the expected number of 8s is 4, so a total of about 6. Bidding 5 8s leverages my two and is safely below the expected count, making for a solid opening bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand (digits: 19627016). With 48 digits in play and 6 players, the average count for any digit is about 4.8. The current bid is 5 8s, which is just above the expected average. Since I hold two 8s myself, it's likely there are at least 3 more among the other 40 digits, making the bid plausible. I will raise to 5 9s, which is the smallest legal higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 5 9s, which means there would need to be at least four more 9s among the other five players. This seems unlikely given the distribution and the fact that 9s are not the most common digit. Challenging is the safer option here.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round, I need to make an opening bid. My hand is 19627016, which contains two 1s, two 6s, one 9, one 2, one 7, and one 0. Opening with a conservative bid based on a digit I have multiple times is strategic. I have two 1s and two 6s, so I will bid 3 1s to start, which is a reasonable and safe opening considering there are 40 digits in play.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:4 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 82399763. I have zero 0s. The current bid is 4 0s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4 (40 / 10 digits). A bid of 4 0s is plausible, as it's the average. However, I have no 0s, making it less likely that there are enough 0s among the other 4 players to reach 4.  Given the low probability of 4 0s when I have none, and the fact that the previous challenge resulted in the bidder winning (suggesting players might be bidding aggressively), challenging seems like a reasonable play here to potentially eliminate a player.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains 0s, 4s, 0s, 7s, 8s, 3s. Given the current total digits remaining is 32, I should make a reasonable bid to increase the quantity and digit. Bidding 4 0s seems plausible, as I have two 0s and the current bid is None.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 0s and one 1 in my hand. The probability there are at least two more 0s among the other 24 cards is about 70%, so challenging 4 0s is too risky. To minimally increase the bid, I can switch to 4 1s: I have one 1 and need three more among the unknown cards (≈44% chance), which is as plausible as bidding 5 0s but a smaller jump. Thus, I will bid 4 1s.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 1s in my hand. With only 24 unseen digits among the other 3 players, the chance they hold at least four 1s is about 21.5%, so the bid of 4 1s is unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 9s and with 24 total digits (16 unknown), the chance of at least one more 9 among them is about 82%. Opening with “3 9s” leverages my strong holding and, being the highest digit at quantity 3, forces opponents to jump straight to quantity 4 if they don’t challenge.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:3 - gpt-4.1-2025-04-14) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 19627016. I have two 1s, one 9, one 6, one 2, one 7, one 0, and one 6. The current bid is 3 9s. I only have one 9. For there to be at least 3 nines, the other two players together would need to have at least 2 nines in their 16 digits. While possible, it's not a particularly strong bid and could be challenged, but it's not extreme enough to guarantee a win by challenging. Instead, I can make a higher bid using a digit I have more of. I have two 1s, so I can bid 3 1s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, lower digit is not valid, but higher quantity is). However, to be strictly higher, I must increase the quantity or, for the same quantity, choose a higher digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, I must increase the quantity. So, I can bid 4 0s, since I have one 0 and it's a reasonable mid-range bid. However, I only have one 0, so that's risky. Alternatively, I can bid 4 1s, since I have two 1s. This gives me a better chance if challenged.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 19627016. Counting the 0s, I have one 0. With 16 digits total and only two players, the probability that there are at least 4 zeros is not negligible, especially given Player 3's history of making successful 0 bids and the previous outcomes where 5 0s and 7 0s were found. However, I only have one 0, so for the bid to be true, Player 3 would need to have at least 3 zeros in their hand, which is possible but not guaranteed. Given the history, Player 3 may be bluffing but has also been correct before. Since 4 is not an extremely high number and the risk of challenging is significant, I will make a higher bid to keep pressure on Player 3. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding 4 1s is reasonable and keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 19627016. I have two 0s. The current bid is 5 0s, meaning there must be at least 5 zeros among all 16 digits. Since I have only 2, Player 3 would need to have at least 3 zeros for the bid to be valid. While it's possible, it's not highly probable. However, bidding 5 1s is possible since I have two 1s, but that also requires Player 3 to have three 1s. Alternatively, I could raise the quantity to 6 of any digit, but with only 2 of any digit in my hand, that's risky. Given the previous history, Player 3 has successfully bid 5 0s before, suggesting they could have a zero-heavy hand, but it's still unlikely they have 3 or more again. The probability of them having 3 or more zeros is low, so challenging is the best option.
