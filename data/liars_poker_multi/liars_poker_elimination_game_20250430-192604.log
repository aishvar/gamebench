Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s is a conservative estimate, as I already have two and expect at least one more 7 in the remaining 40 digits across other players. This is a safe starting bid that balances my holdings with reasonable expectations for total distribution.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have the digits 2, 6, 0, 5, 2, 8, 4, 5. Counting the 7s in my hand: none. The current bid is 3 7s, which is unlikely given my hand and the total of 48 digits. Since I have no 7s, the actual count is at most 0, making the current bid impossible to fulfill. Challenging now would be logical, as the bid is clearly false.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. As the first player to bid, starting with 3 7s is reasonable because I already have two, and it's likely at least one more exists in the remaining 32 digits. This is a conservative opening bid that balances my hand's composition with the total possible digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. My hand contains two 8s, and bidding 3 8s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my knowledge of my own digits without assuming others' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I only have one 8, bidding 4 0s or 4 1s might be risky without more information. However, bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid and I don't have any 9s, but it's a small increment and plausible. Given the current bid is low, raising to 3 9s is a cautious and valid move to keep the game going.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand, I have only one 9. With 5 active players having 8 digits each (40 total), and the current bid being '3 9s', I need to consider: 1) I only see one 9 in my hand, 2) The previous bidder seems confident enough to bid 9s, 3) There's still room for 2 more 9s among other players' hands to make the bid valid. Given this is a reasonable possibility and I don't have strong evidence to challenge, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, but bidding '4 5s' would be risky. A safer play is to increase the quantity minimally to '4 0s', especially since I have one 0 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I hold two 0s, so zeros ≥4 is very likely (~84%), making a challenge unwise. To minimally increase the bid, I switch to digit 1: I have one 1, and the other 32 cards should contain ~3.2 more ones on average, giving a ~63% chance that there are at least four 1s. This is a safer raise than jumping to 5 zeros.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 4 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit) and is highly likely to be true given the expected distribution of digits. Challenging 4 1s carries risk since the expected number of 1s is close to 4. A safe bid is preferable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains two 8s. Bidding 4 8s is a valid move as it maintains the same quantity (4) but increases the digit, which is higher than the current bid of 4 7s. This leverages my existing digits without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand has one 8. Given there are 40 digits total and 5 active players, 4 8s is a reasonable bid. To raise, I must bid higher than 4 8s. The next higher bid could be 4 9s or 5 0s. I have one 9 and one 0 in my hand. Bidding 4 9s is the smallest increment. Since I only have one 9, and the bid is for 4, it is a moderate risk but plausible. Bidding 5 0s is a bigger leap and riskier. Therefore, I will bid 4 9s to keep the game going with a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid of 4 9s means there need to be at least 3 more 9s among the other four players (40 total digits). While possible, this seems unlikely given: 1) Players tend to bid based on what they have, 2) The bidding sequence shows increasing digits but same quantities, suggesting players might be bluffing, 3) In the previous round, we learned there were 5 7s total, and having 4 of a single digit is less common. Given my single 9, I don't feel confident there are enough 9s to support this bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s. Bidding 4 8s increases the quantity and leverages a digit I already hold, making the bid more plausible. With four active players, it's reasonable to assume at least two more 8s exist in others' hands. Challenging the current bid of 3 0s is risky since my single 0 plus potential others could meet the threshold.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains two 8s. The current bid is 4 8s, which requires at least four 8s in total. Since I have two, and there are three other players, it's possible others have two more. Bidding 5 8s increases the quantity, making it a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 8s while pushing the total higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Given there are 32 digits total and only one 8 visible in my hand, having at least five 8s overall is plausible but somewhat high. To continue, I must bid higher than 5 8s, either by increasing quantity or digit. Increasing quantity to 6 0s might be risky since I have only one 0, but increasing the digit to 5 9s is not possible because 9 is higher than 8 but the quantity is the same and must be higher or digit higher with the same quantity. So, the next valid bid is 6 0s or 5 9s. I have one 0, so bidding 6 0s is a stretch but possible. Bidding 5 9s is a valid higher bid as same quantity but higher digit. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding 5 9s seems safer than 6 0s. Therefore, I will bid 5 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I only have one 9 in my hand, so to meet a bid of 5 9s we need at least four 9s among the 24 unknown cards. The probability of that is only about 37%, so there’s a roughly 62% chance the bid is a lie. Raising to 6 of any digit would be even more unlikely. It’s better to challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 2 7s increases the digit value while maintaining the same quantity. This is a valid higher bid and leverages my known digits to support the claim. Challenging the current bid would risk elimination if the 2 0s are valid, which is plausible given the total digits.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand and need at least one more 8 among the 16 unknown cards to satisfy 2 8s. The probability of at least one 8 in 16 cards is about 81.5%, so a challenge is likely to lose. I’ll make the minimal raise by increasing the digit to 9 while keeping quantity at 2 to stay conservative.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s. Bidding 3 8s increases the quantity from 2 to 3, which is a valid higher bid. Since I have two 8s, and the other two players have 16 digits, it's plausible there's at least one more 8. This bid is more likely to hold than challenging the current 2 9s bid, which has a reasonable chance of being true given my single 9 and the remaining digits.
