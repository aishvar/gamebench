Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 90341852, which contains a variety of digits. I count the digits in my hand: 0 appears once, 1 appears once, 2 appears once, 3 appears once, 4 appears once, 5 appears once, 8 appears once, 9 appears once. I have a total of 8 digits. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I see. Since I have one 5, and there are 5 other players, it's possible that there are more 5s. Bidding 8 5s seems like a reasonable starting point as it reflects a digit I have and is a moderate quantity considering the total number of digits is 48.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, the average number of 6s is around 48 / 10 = 4.8. A bid of 8 6s is significantly higher than the average. While possible, it's a high bid early in the game. I have two 5s and two 9s, which are higher than the current bid's digit if I were to bid the same quantity. However, increasing the quantity to 9 seems risky given the current bid is already high. Challenging 8 6s is a reasonable move as it's above the expected count, and Player 1 might be bluffing.

Player 2 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round. I have two 5s, one 6, one 7, one 2, one 8, and two 9s in my hand. A common strategy for the first bid is to bid based on your strongest digit or a digit you have multiple of. I have two 5s and two 9s. Bidding 2 5s or 2 9s would be a safe starting bid. Bidding 2 5s seems reasonable given I have two of them and it's a common starting point.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s. Bidding 3 2s increases the quantity while using a digit I have, making the bid more likely to be true. Challenging the low bid of 2 5s is risky since the expected number of 5s in 40 digits is higher.

Player 4 Reasoning: I can see one 2 in my hand, so the current bid of 3 2s is very likely to be true across 40 total digits; challenging would probably eliminate me. To stay in the game I need to raise the bid. A minimal but legal raise is to keep the quantity at 3 and pick a higher digit. I have one 6 in my own hand, and with 40 digits in play the average count of any digit is about 4, so 3 6s is a safe, credible bid that doesn’t over-commit.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which is a lower digit than 8. Bidding 3 8s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, leveraging my confidence in having two 8s and assuming at least one more exists among the remaining 32 digits (from 4 other players). This is a logical higher bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll make a conservative bid by increasing the digit. Bidding 3 9s is a valid move as it is higher than 3 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s. The current bid is 3 9s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. While I have two 9s, the bid of 3 9s is not excessively high. However, given the previous bids and the fact that Player 0 made this bid, I have to consider the possibility that they have at least one 9. Bidding 4 9s would be a significant jump, but bidding 4 of a lower digit is also an option. Bidding 4 0s is the lowest possible higher bid in terms of digit. Given the uncertainty and the fact that I have two 9s, challenging is risky if Player 0 has one or more 9s. Bidding 4 0s is a safer progression.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, but three 2s. Bidding 4 2s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is more likely to be true given the expected distribution of digits. With three 2s in my hand and 32 digits remaining across four players, it's probable there is at least one more 2, making the total count ≥4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I hold one 6. When I earlier bid 3 6s no one challenged, implying the table already finds the idea of several 6s plausible. With 40 digits in play the average count of any digit is about 4, so needing only three more 6s among the 32 unknown digits gives roughly a 60 % chance the bid is true. Challenging the current bid of 4 2s would only succeed about 37 % of the time, which is too risky. The safest move is to raise the digit while keeping the same quantity, so I’ll bid 4 6s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. I previously bid 3 8s in this round, so increasing to 4 8s aligns with my holdings and maintains pressure on the table. This bid is strictly higher than the current 4 6s bid (same quantity, higher digit).

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Considering there are 4 other players and a total of 40 digits, a bid of 4 8s is plausible but on the lower side given the total count of digits. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since my hand contains a variety of digits, I can analyze the possibility of a higher bid. Bidding 5 0s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity and is a different digit. However, I should first assess if there's a more likely digit to be abundant. Given my hand (90341852), I see a mix of digits. Noting that there's already a bid on 8s, and I have one 8, I can consider bidding on a higher digit or increasing the quantity for a digit that seems plausible. Bidding 4 9s is an option as it is a higher digit than 8 and I have one 9 in my hand. It's a safer increase as it doesn't jump too high in quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 40/10 = 4. The current bid is exactly the expected value. Given I hold two 9s, it's plausible that there are at least two more 9s among the other four players. However, the bid is already at the expected value, and the previous player bid 4 9s. Bidding higher requires either a much higher quantity or a higher digit. Bidding 5 of any digit seems risky. Bidding 4 of a higher digit is possible, but I don't have a strong hand in any higher digits (my highest is a 9, which is the current bid). Given the bid is at the expected value and I only hold two of the bid digit, challenging seems like a reasonable option, especially considering the previous player might be bluffing or just trying to push the bid higher.

Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with 4 active players and 32 total digits. Since there's no current bid, I need to make the first bid. My hand is 90341852, which contains two 5s and one 9. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and a conservative estimate. I see that I have a relatively high digit (9) and a decent count of 5s. Bidding 6 5s is a moderate start, considering the total count of digits and the fact that I'm starting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand (07282492). The current bid of 6 5s requires at least six 5s across all four players' 32 digits. With an expected average of ~3.2 total 5s (10% probability per digit), 6 seems unlikely. Challenging is optimal since the burden of proof falls on the bidder (Player 0) to justify this high count relative to typical distribution.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand, and the first bid needs to be any valid quantity. Bidding 4 2s is reasonable as it adds one to my current count, assuming at least one more 2 exists in the other players' hands. Starting with a lower digit increases the likelihood of a successful bid, as 2s are more probable to be distributed among the remaining players compared to higher or less common digits.

Player 4 Reasoning: I see only one 2 in my hand, so I can’t rely on my own cards to disprove the bid. Since Player 3 opened the round they are likely sitting on multiple 2s, making a direct challenge too risky. Rather than raise the quantity (which would invite an easy challenge), I’ll keep the quantity at four but move the digit up to something I hold (a 6). This is the smallest legal raise, stays plausible, and pushes the decision to Player 5 instead of taking a 50-plus % risk on a challenge now.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have no 6s in my hand, and with 24 total digits across all players, the expected count of any specific digit (like 6s) is ~2.4. Since the bid requires at least 4 6s, which exceeds the statistical average, challenging seems favorable. Player 4's bid likely relies on bluffing or minimal 6s in their hand, making the actual count likely below 4.
