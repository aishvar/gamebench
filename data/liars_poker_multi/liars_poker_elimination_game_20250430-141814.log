Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning I can make any initial bid. I should start with a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand contains one 8. Starting with '1 8s' seems reasonable as it's based on my own hand and allows the game to proceed.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid of 1 8s seems low, especially considering the total digits remaining. I should increase the quantity to at least 2 8s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4.8 (48 / 10 digits). A bid of 2 9s is slightly below average, and I hold one of the 9s. Bidding 3 2s is a safe option, as I have two 2s and it's a valid higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. In my hand (42659846), I have one 2. With 48 digits in play and only a bid of 3, it's plausible there are at least three 2s across all hands. Challenging here is risky. To make a strictly higher bid, I can either bid 3 3s (same quantity, higher digit) or 4 of any digit. In my hand, I have two 4s, two 6s, two 8s, one 2, one 5, and one 9. Bidding 3 4s (same quantity, higher digit) leverages my hand strength, as I hold two 4s. This keeps the bid reasonable and increases the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand (from 90439941). The current bid is 3 4s, which means there needs to be at least one more 4 among the other players' hands to make the bid valid. Given that the bid is relatively low and I already have two 4s, it's likely that the bid is valid. To stay in the game, I should make a higher bid. Increasing the digit to 5s seems reasonable, as I have one 5 in my hand and the bid history hasn't shown many high digits yet.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 5. I have a 5 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 5, increasing the quantity to 4 or more might be risky without knowing others' hands. However, I can safely increase the digit. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit and I have a 7 in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s and Player 0 made it. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable, but I can do better. I also have one 8 and one 9, but no other digits in high quantities. However, I don't have enough information to challenge the bid. Bidding 4 7s seems the best option.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains one 9, one 6, one 5, one 3, two 2s, one 1, and one 0. The current bid is 4 8s. With 48 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4.8.  While 4 8s is plausible, the bid history shows a steady increase. I have two 2s. Bidding 5 2s increases the quantity significantly but is plausible if other players have 2s. Bidding 4 9s is a smaller increase in quantity but a higher digit, and I have one 9.  Given the current bid and my hand, bidding 5 2s seems like a reasonable step up based on my hand strength in 2s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. In my hand (42659846), I have one 2 and two 4s. With 6 players and 48 digits total, the average for any digit is about 4.8. Since I only have one 2, and 5 is slightly above average, but not unreasonable, it's risky to challenge now. I can safely make a higher bid based on my hand. I have two 4s, so I will bid 5 4s to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand (from 90439941). The current bid is 5 4s, which is quite high but not impossible given that there are 48 digits in total. However, with only two 4s in my hand, and considering the previous bids, it's unlikely that there are at least five 4s across all players. Therefore, I should challenge the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round, I want to make a safe opening bid based on my hand. My hand is 42659846, which contains two 4s, two 6s, two 8s, one 2, and one 9. Since there are 5 players and 40 digits in play, it's reasonable to assume that at least three of any digit are likely present. I will start with a modest bid based on one of the digits I have two of, to keep my options open and not reveal too much about my hand. I will bid 3 4s.

Since the bid is 3 4s, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 4 3s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and utilizes the digits I have.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 4.  A bid of 4 5s is right at the expected value. Bidding 5 2s is a strong possibility since I have two 2s. Alternatively, bidding 5 3s is also possible as I have one 3, and it's a higher digit than 2.  Given the previous bids, raising the quantity to 5 seems reasonable. Bidding on 2s is safer due to my hand, but 3s is a higher digit. I'll go with 5 2s as it's supported by my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand (digits: 4, 4), which is a strong showing for that digit. The current bid is 5 2s, which I cannot challenge yet since it's my turn to bid higher or challenge. I do not have any 2s, making me skeptical of the current bid, but with 40 digits in play and 5 players, it's plausible there are 5 or more 2s. To stay in the game and given my strong holding in 4s, I will bid 5 4s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages my hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s made by Player 4. I have a 3 and a 4 in my hand. Given that there are 5 players and each player has 8 digits, there are 40 digits in total. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. The current bid of 5 4s needs to be surpassed. I can see that bidding higher than 5 is risky without knowing the distribution of digits. However, I can try to bid a higher digit with the same or higher quantity. Since my hand contains a 3 and I know there are 40 total digits, bidding 6 3s seems reasonable as it is higher in quantity than the current bid of 5 4s and my hand supports having at least 6 3s if we consider all players' hands.

A bid of 6 5s is slightly above average, but not unreasonable given the previous bids. However, I have two 2s in my hand, and I can make a higher bid based on those. Bidding 6 6s is a valid higher bid and uses a digit I have at least one of, making it a safer bid than increasing the quantity significantly.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 42659846, which contains two 6s. The current bid is 6 6s. With 40 digits in play and only two 6s in my hand, there would need to be four more 6s among the remaining 32 digits (across four players). The expected number of 6s in 32 random digits is about 3.2, making 6 total 6s plausible but not guaranteed. However, since 6 is still a reasonable bid, and I can safely increase the bid by moving to 6 7s (since I have one 7), I will make a higher bid to avoid a risky challenge.

I can see that bidding a higher quantity with a lower digit or the same quantity with a higher digit is possible.

Given that the previous bids were 1 0s, 2 2s, and now 3 4s, I should consider the likelihood of there being at least 3 fours. Since I don't have any 4s in my hand and only 2 threes, I need to assess if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. The total number of digits across all players is 32. If I bid, I must go higher than 3 4s. Bidding 4 3s seems reasonable as I have 2 threes and it increases the quantity.

With only one 2 in my hand, there would need to be at least two more 2s among the other 16 digits held by the other two players. This is plausible, as the expected count for any digit across 24 digits is about 2.4. Therefore, challenging now is risky. The safest move is to make a higher bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 96532210. The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 and two 2s. With 24 digits total, the expected number of any digit is around 2.4. A bid of 4 3s seems plausible, especially since one player was eliminated for challenging a bid that was correct. I have two 2s, and the bid of 3 2s was made earlier in this round. Bidding 4 4s is higher than 4 3s and I don't have any 4s, making it a bit speculative. Bidding 5 2s is a possibility based on my hand and the previous bid of 3 2s, but it's a significant jump. Given the previous challenge failures, I'm hesitant to challenge unless the bid is clearly unreasonable. Bidding 5 2s seems like a reasonable next step based on my hand and the history.

Since each player has 8 digits, on average, each digit appears about 2.4 times per player, but 2s are not especially common in my hand. While not impossible, 5 2s is a somewhat risky bid. However, it's early in the round and not an extreme bid. I'll make a conservative higher bid based on my hand: I have two 4s, so I'll bid 5 4s, which is a valid next bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s made by Player 4. My hand contains 81130537, which means I have 2 threes and 1 four. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and there are only 24 digits in total, bidding 6 3s seems reasonable as it is higher than the current bid and based on my hand. I will increase the quantity and stick with a digit I have.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. The total number of digits is 24. The expected number of 3s is around 2.4 (24 * 0.1). Six 3s is a high bid relative to the expected count and the number of digits remaining. Given the previous challenges and the relatively high current bid, challenging '6 3s' seems like a reasonable move, especially since I only hold one 3.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 42659846. The current bid is 2 2s. I have zero 2s in my hand, but with 16 total digits, it's not an outrageous bid—it's possible Player 3 has two or more 2s. However, this is a very low opening bid and challenging now is risky. I should make a higher bid. I have three 4s in my hand (digits: 4, 4, 4), so bidding 3 4s is a strong move, as it's likely to be true and puts pressure on Player 3.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. With 16 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 1.6. A bid of 3 4s is slightly higher than expected. However, I have two 2s in my hand and the previous bid was 2 2s. I can increase the bid based on my strong hand in 2s, or slightly increase the bid on 4s. Bidding 3 5s is a safe increase in digit, or 4 2s is an increase in quantity based on my hand. Given the history of challenges and the relatively low current bid, increasing the bid seems safer than challenging. Bidding 3 5s is a small, reasonable increment.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 42659846. Counting the digits, I have two 4s, two 6s, two 8s, one 2, and one 5. The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5, so for there to be at least three 5s, Player 3 would need to have at least two 5s in their hand, which is possible but not guaranteed. However, it is not an outlandishly high bid. Instead of challenging, I can make a higher bid that leverages the digits I have in abundance. I have two 4s, two 6s, and two 8s. Since I already bid 3 4s, the next valid bid could be 3 6s (same quantity, higher digit), which is a safe incremental raise based on my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. With 16 total digits, bidding 3 6s means Player 4 thinks there are at least two 6s in their hand. While possible, it's not overwhelmingly likely. However, challenging 3 6s is risky as Player 4 could have two or more 6s. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s, one 0, one 1, one 3, one 5, one 6, and one 9. Bidding 4 of any digit is a significant jump. Bidding 3 7s or higher is an option, but I don't have many high digits. Bidding 4 2s is an option based on my hand, but it's a large jump from 3 6s. Given the bid is only 3 6s, and I have one, it's plausible Player 4 has two, so challenging is risky. Bidding 4 2s is a reasonable next bid based on my hand strength in 2s.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 42659846, containing the digits: 4, 2, 6, 5, 9, 8, 4, 6. I have one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 4 2s, meaning there must be at least four 2s among all 16 digits. Since I only have one, Player 3 would need to have at least three 2s for the bid to be valid, which is unlikely given the distribution of digits. The probability of Player 3 having three or more 2s in their eight digits is low. Therefore, I should challenge.
