Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable starting point, as there are 5 other players who could each contribute at least one 8. This bid is conservative and leverages my existing digits while allowing room for others' hands.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have three 8s in my hand, which makes this bid likely true. However, I also have three 7s. Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable next bid as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have an 8 in my hand, and the current bid is 4 7s. Bidding 4 8s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing digit and follows the rules for increasing the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. The expected number of 8s across 48 digits is 4.8. Even though I have zero 8s in my hand, the probability of the other 5 players having at least four 8s among their 40 digits is still over 50%. Challenging this bid is too risky as it is close to the average expectation. I must make a higher bid. My hand contains two 2s, which is the digit I have most of. Bidding 5 2s is a valid higher bid (quantity 5 is greater than quantity 4) and is well-supported by the two 2s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand and no 2s. To make 5 total 3s, only three more are needed among the other 40 cards, which is likely (~78% chance). Bidding 5 3s is a valid, conservative increase over 5 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The bid is at '5 3s', meaning Player 4 claims there are at least 5 threes among all players' hands. Looking at my own hand (09593074), I have one 3. With 6 players having 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For there to be 5 threes total, there would need to be 4 more threes among the other players' hands, which is quite possible. Given that I have one 3 myself, the bid seems reasonable. I need to either make a higher bid or challenge. Since I don't have strong evidence to challenge, I'll make a higher bid. I notice I have two 9s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 9s. I could bid '5 9s', which keeps the same quantity but increases the digit value, making it a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:5 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have no 9s in my hand, and the expected number of 9s in 40 remaining digits (from 5 players) is 4. Bidding higher (e.g., 6 0s) risks an unsupported claim, while challenging leverages the low probability of 5+ 9s. Challenging is strategically sound if the bid is likely false.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I'm starting this round as the first bidder. Looking at my hand (09593074), I have one 9, one 5, one 3, one 0, one 7, and one 4. Based on the previous round, I know there are at least some 9s among other players since my bid of 5 9s was challenged and the actual count was 6 (with my one 9 included). A conservative starting bid would be reasonable. Since I have one 9 in my hand, I could start with a bid of 3 9s, assuming there are at least 2 more 9s among the other players, which seems reasonable given the previous round's information. Alternatively, I could bid on 3s or 5s since I have those in my hand as well. I'll go with 3 9s as a strategic opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 7s and three 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s. Given that there are 40 digits remaining and considering the previous bids, it's reasonable to assume that there are more 7s or 8s in the other players' hands. Bidding 4 7s or 4 8s seems reasonable, but since I have three 8s, bidding 4 8s is a safer choice.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand contains two 4s, and bidding 5 4s increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages the higher quantity rule while targeting a digit I have evidence of in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:1 - openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. The expected average count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. A bid of 5 is slightly above this average. The probability of having 5 or more 4s in 40 digits (with p=0.1 for each digit) is approximately 40.7%. This means there is a 1 - 0.407 = 59.3% chance that the actual count of 4s is less than 5. Since challenging wins if the actual count is less than the bid, challenging 5 4s has a 59.3% probability of success, making it a statistically favorable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round, so I must make a bid strictly higher than 'None'. My hand contains two 2s. With 32 total digits across 4 players, the average frequency of any digit is 3.2. Having two 2s in my hand is above average for my hand (0.8 expected per digit). Based on probability, I can expect around 2-3 more 2s from the other 24 digits (3 players * 8 digits / 10 digits = 2.4 expected per digit across other hands). Bidding 4 2s is a reasonable starting bid based on my hand and the expected total count.

Player 4 Reasoning: I hold zero 2s, so all 4 claimed 2s must be among the other 24 cards. The expected number of 2s there is 2.4 and the chance of 4 or more is only about 21%, so challenging is likely to win.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand and, by extrapolation, expect about six 9s across all 24 cards. Opening with 3 9s is a conservative bid and, being the highest digit, forces any same-quantity overbid to jump to four cards, which is riskier for my opponents.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge Player 4's bid of '3 9s'. Looking at my hand (09593074), I have one 9. This means there need to be at least two more 9s between Player 1 and Player 4 for the bid to be valid. With 24 total digits in play and 8 digits per player, this is certainly possible. Since I have one 9 myself, the bid seems reasonable. I'll make a higher bid. I could bid '4 0s' since I have one 0 in my hand, but that's risky. Instead, I'll bid '3 0s' which keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit (from 9 to 0, where 0 is considered higher than 9 in this game). This is a safe move that maintains pressure while being likely valid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. I can make a bid higher than 4 0s by increasing the digit. Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable move, as it is likely that between all three players, there are at least 4 sevens. Challenging 4 0s seems risky, as it is plausible that there are at least four 0s among the three players' hands.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have only one 7 in my hand. Among the other 16 cards, the expected number of 7s is about 1.6, so total 7s is likely around 2–3. The chance of having at least 4 7s is under 25%, making the current bid unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge Player 1's bid of 5 7s. Looking at my hand (09593074), I have only 1 seven. Since there are 16 total digits between us (8 each), Player 1 would need to have at least 4 sevens in their hand for their bid to be valid. While possible, this is somewhat unlikely. The probability of Player 1 having 4 or more sevens in 8 random digits is fairly low. However, Player 1 has shown good judgment in previous rounds (they correctly bid 4 7s earlier when there were actually 5). Given that I only have one option to challenge or bid higher, and I'm not extremely confident in challenging, I'll make a higher bid. I'll bid 6 0s since I have one zero in my hand, which makes this a reasonable increase.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have two 7s and two 8s in my hand. Since there are 16 digits remaining, it's likely that there are at least 6 0s in total. Challenging seems risky.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. In my hand (09593074), I have zero 7s. The current bid is 7 7s made by Player 1. Since there are 16 total digits in play (8 from me and 8 from Player 1), and I have zero 7s, that would mean Player 1 would need to have 7 or more 7s in their hand for this bid to be valid. The probability of having 7 or more of the same digit in an 8-digit hand is extremely low. Additionally, looking at the bidding pattern, Player 1 started with 5 7s, then after my 6 0s bid, they increased to 7 7s, which suggests they might be bluffing. Given that I have zero 7s and the statistical improbability of Player 1 having 7 7s in their 8-digit hand, challenging is the best move.
