Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', which means I can make any initial bid. I have two 5s in my hand. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each, there are a total of 48 digits. Making a conservative bid seems reasonable. I will bid 2 5s as it's based on my hand and not too high to be suspicious.

Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (07318212), I don't have any 5s. Player 0 has bid 2 5s, which is a relatively low bid considering there are 6 players with 8 digits each (48 total digits). Even without any 5s in my hand, it's quite possible that at least 2 5s exist among the other 40 digits held by other players. I should make a higher bid. I have two 1s and two 2s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on either of these digits. I'll bid 3 1s, increasing the quantity by 1 from the current bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains three 8s, which supports a bid of 3 8s. This is a higher bid than 3 1s by increasing the digit value while maintaining the same quantity. Since I have three 8s, it is plausible that the total across all players meets or exceeds this bid, making it a safe and strategic move.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which means there are at least two more 8s among the other five players. Given that there are 40 other digits (5 players * 8 digits each), it's plausible but not certain. I could bid higher, like 3 9s or 4 of a lower digit, but without more information, challenging seems reasonable to avoid overbidding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 4 8s is reasonable, as it accounts for my own digits and assumes at least one additional 8 exists among the remaining 4 players (28 digits). This bid is conservative yet assertive enough to prompt opponents to either challenge or raise, leveraging my strong holdings in 8s.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:1 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 06504516, which contains no 8s. The current bid is 4 8s by Player 2. With 5 active players and a total of 40 digits, the bid of 4 8s is possible but on the lower side of likelihood since it requires at least 4 8s across all hands. In the previous round, the count of 8s was 7 when there were 6 players (48 digits), which suggests a relatively high frequency of 8s. Given that only one player was eliminated, it's plausible that at least 4 8s still remain among the 40 digits. I don't want to challenge yet as the bid seems reasonable based on past data. Instead, I'll make a higher bid to keep the game moving and test the waters. I'll bid 5 0s since I have two 0s in my hand, making it a somewhat grounded bid while increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand (6, 9, 7, 1, 6, 9, 5, 4). The current bid is 5 0s, which means there must be at least five 0s among the 40 digits. Since I hold none, the other four players would need to collectively have at least five 0s, averaging more than one per hand. Statistically, this is plausible but not guaranteed. However, since the bid is not extremely high and there is a reasonable chance that the other hands contain enough 0s, it is safer to raise the bid rather than challenge. I will make the minimum legal higher bid, which is 5 1s. I have one 1 in my hand, making this a safer bid.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s made by Player 5. I have one 1 in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 40 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Since I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than 5 1s, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 6 0s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and utilizes a digit that could potentially be common.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the likelihood of there being 6 or more 0s in all players' hands. In my hand, I have one 0 (07318212). The current bid of '6 0s' means Player 0 believes there are at least 6 zeros across all 5 players. Since I have 1 zero, that means there would need to be at least 5 more zeros among the other 4 players' 32 digits. This is plausible but not certain. Looking at the bidding pattern, Player 4 previously bid '5 0s', suggesting they might have some zeros in their hand. Player 0 increased this to '6 0s', which could mean they have at least one zero as well. Given that I have only 1 zero, and the total required would be 6, I think this bid is risky but possible. I'll make a higher bid focusing on 1s, since I have two 1s in my hand, and Player 5 previously bid on 1s, suggesting there might be several in play.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains no 1s, and the current bid is 6 1s. With 40 total digits and only 5 active players, it's unlikely there are six 1s when I have none. Challenging is the best option to test the validity of the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make a reasonable opening bid based on my hand. I have three 8s in my hand. Bidding 4 8s is logical because it requires only one additional 8 from the other three players, which is plausible. This bid is grounded in my own digits and sets a moderate starting point for the round.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 06504516, which contains two 0s, two 5s, one 6, one 4, and one 1, but no 8s. The current bid by Player 2 is 4 8s. Given that there are 32 total digits across 4 players, and I have no 8s in my hand, the bid of 4 8s means that the other 3 players must collectively have at least 4 8s among their 24 digits. This is possible (e.g., each could have one or two 8s), and considering the previous round where the count of 8s was 7 when there were more players, it's not unreasonable to think there could still be at least 4 8s now. Challenging might be risky since the bid isn't excessively high. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. I have two 0s, so bidding 5 0s seems plausible as it increases the quantity from 4 to 5 and switches to a different digit. This keeps the game moving and avoids an immediate challenge risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand (69716954). The bid is 5 0s, meaning there must be at least five 0s among the 32 digits. With none in my hand, that leaves 24 digits among the other 3 players needing to contain at least 5 zeros. The expected number of 0s per 8-digit hand is less than 1 (since each digit 0-9 is equally likely, expected count per player is 0.8 zeros per hand, so about 2.4 zeros among the other hands). This makes the bid very risky. I should challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s made by Player 5. I have one 6 in my hand. Given that there are only 24 total digits remaining and 3 active players (which means 24 digits in total), bidding higher seems risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding 3 6s would be a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity. But first, I should consider if challenging could be more beneficial, given that 2 6s might be a stretch considering the total digits left. Since I have one 6, and assuming the others might have a few, challenging seems like a plausible option but I need to make a valid higher bid if I choose not to challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand (79802088). The current bid is 3 6s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages my actual holdings. Since I have three 8s, the bid is truthful and forces opponents to either challenge or raise further. Challenging the current bid carries risk as the expected number of 6s (2.4) is close to the bid (3), making it uncertain.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 69716954, which contains one 6 and one 9, one 7, one 1, one 6, one 9, one 5, and one 4. Specifically, I have two 6s, two 9s, one 7, one 1, one 5, and one 4. The current bid is 3 8s. In the previous round, a bid of 3 8s was actually safe, with 7 total 8s among 24 digits, indicating 8s may be relatively common in this set. However, I have zero 8s in my hand, which means all 8s must be in the other two hands, and it's possible but not certain that there are at least 3. Since it's plausible, but I have no 8s, I'll make a higher bid based on my own hand. I have two 6s, so I can safely bid 4 6s, which is a higher quantity and a digit I have strong knowledge of.

Since my hand has three 6s and there are only 24 digits in total, bidding a higher quantity seems risky without knowing the exact distribution of digits among other players. However, I can see that bidding 4 8s would be a valid higher bid as it increases the digit value. Given that my hand contains an 8 and there are 24 total digits left, I should consider if challenging is more beneficial or if I can make a reasonable bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which requires at least one more 8 in the remaining 16 digits of Players 0 and 5. Given that 16 digits remain and digits are randomly distributed, it's highly likely there's at least one additional 8. However, bidding 5 8s increases the required count to five total 8s (I have three, needing two more). While this is riskier, challenging the current bid would be even riskier since the 4 8s bid is likely true. Bidding 5 8s maintains pressure and leverages my strong hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 69716954, which contains one 8. The current bid is 5 8s. With 24 digits in play (8 per player, 3 players), the average count for any digit is about 2.4. For there to be at least 5 8s, the other two players would need to have at least 4 8s between them. In the previous round, Player 2 successfully bid high on 8s (even 7 out of 32), suggesting they may have a strong hand in 8s, but that was with more digits. It's possible Player 2 is bluffing or overreaching, as 5 8s is high for 24 digits. Since I only have one 8 and the probability of the other two players having 4 or more 8s is quite low, I'm going to challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 2. I have the hand 84954528, which contains two 8s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. The current bid of 4 8s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be a bluff. My hand has two 8s, so I can consider bidding higher on 8s or another digit. However, bidding higher on 8s (e.g., 5 8s) seems risky without knowing Player 2's hand. I can also consider bidding on another digit that I have, like 5s or 6s, but I need to ensure it's a valid higher bid.
