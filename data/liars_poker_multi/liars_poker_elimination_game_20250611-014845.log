Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. With five other players each holding eight digits, it is highly probable that there is at least one more 4 among them, making a total of at least four 4s. This makes '4 4s' a reasonable and safe opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. With 5 other players, it's possible there are at least 3 more 4s among them, making the current bid of 4 4s plausible. To stay competitive, I'll increase the bid slightly by raising the digit to 5, which I also have one of in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s. Bidding 4 9s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid. Since I have two 9s, it's plausible that others have two more, making the total 4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 6,3,6,0,1,3,7,3, giving me three 3s. The current bid is 4 9s; challenging is risky. Bidding 5 3s means I only need two more 3s among the 40 unknown digits, which has over an 85% chance. This safely raises the quantity and uses the digit I hold most.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '5 3s' and decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge. Looking at my hand (48497895), I have zero 3s. The previous player bid that there are at least 5 threes among all 48 digits. This means the other 5 players would need to have at least 5 threes between them, which is an average of 1 three per player. This seems quite possible and not worth challenging. For my bid, I have one 4, one 8, one 9, one 7, and two 5s in my hand. Since I have two 5s, I could bid '5 5s' which maintains the same quantity but increases the digit. This is a valid higher bid based on what I know from my hand.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:4 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 71470364. I have zero 5s. The current bid is 5 5s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average number of any digit is 4.8 (48 / 10 digits). A bid of 5 5s is slightly above average for a single digit. Since I have none, it's less likely there are 5 or more 5s among the other 5 players. While not impossible, challenging seems like a reasonable move given my hand and the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round. My hand is 71470364. I have two 7s, two 4s, one 1, one 0, one 3, and one 6. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.  Bidding 3 7s seems a reasonable starting bid, slightly above average and supported by having two 7s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 and one 8 in my hand. The current bid of 3 7s by Player 5 is likely valid, as I have one 7 and expect at least two more from the other players based on the expected distribution of digits. Challenging could be risky. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid since 8 > 7, and it leverages my hand containing an 8, making it a plausible move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which seems plausible given my hand and the fact that there are four other players who might have additional 8s. However, bidding higher would require either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have strong evidence to suggest a higher quantity is likely, and increasing the digit would be risky without knowing other players' hands, I choose to challenge the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. As the first bidder with no current bid, bidding 3 4s is a safe and conservative choice because the total count must be at least three, reducing the risk of a successful challenge. This sets a low starting point for the bidding round.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:3 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s. Bidding 4 9s increases the quantity and leverages my known 9s, making it a plausible bid. With 24 remaining digits across other players, the expected number of 9s is 2.4, so adding my 2 gives a total of ~4.4, supporting the bid of 4 9s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I hold no 9s. Out of the 24 unknown digits, the expected number of 9s is only 2.4 and the chance of seeing at least 4 among them is under 22%. A bid of 4 9s is highly unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand. Only one more 3 among the other 16 digits is needed to meet a bid of 4 3s, which has about an 82% chance. This gives me a strong, defensible opening.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:4 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. With 24 total digits, a bid of 4 3s is not unreasonable (average is 2.4 per digit). However, I have two 7s and two 4s. Bidding 5 4s or 5 7s would be a stronger bid based on my hand, and higher than the current bid. Given my hand composition, bidding 5 4s seems like a reasonable step up.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. With 24 total digits, the expected number of 4s is 2.4, but since I hold three, the expected from other players is reduced. Based on a uniform distribution assumption, the probability of Player 3 and Player 5 having fewer than two 4s combined (resulting in total <5) is approximately 51.5%, making a challenge slightly favorable. Bidding higher is risky due to my limited high-digit cards (e.g., no 5s or 6s, only one 7 or 8) and the aggressive bidding history from Player 5.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round with 16 total digits remaining. My hand is 71470364. I have two 7s and two 4s. A safe starting bid is generally around the average expected count for a digit (16 total digits / 10 digits = 1.6 per digit). Bidding based on my strongest digits is a good strategy. I have two 7s, so bidding 2 7s is a safe starting point. Alternatively, I have two 4s, so 2 4s is also an option. Since there is no current bid, I can choose any valid bid. Bidding 2 7s is a reasonable and safe starting bid based on my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s and I only have one 7, so challenging now has under 50% success. Instead I can safely raise to 3 3s because I hold three 3s, guaranteeing the bid holds and it’s a valid increase in quantity from 2 to 3.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 71470364. I have one 3. Player 3 bid 3 3s. With 16 total digits, the average count for any digit is 1.6. A bid of 3 3s is above average, but not extremely improbable, especially if Player 3 has multiple 3s. I have two 7s and two 4s, which are good candidates for a higher bid. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid and is supported by my hand. Bidding 3 4s is also valid but less strong than 3 7s. Bidding 4 of any digit is also valid. Given my hand, 3 7s or 4 4s are reasonable options. 3 7s is a simple step up in digit from 3 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The bid of 3 7s requires the opponent to hold at least two 7s among their 8 digits. Even with random distribution, the chance of two or more 7s is under 20%, so this bid is unlikely to be true. I should challenge.
