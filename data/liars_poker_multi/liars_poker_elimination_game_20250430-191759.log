Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make an initial bid. My hand contains two 4s, which is a solid starting point. Bidding 2 4s is a truthful and reasonable first move, as it reflects the actual count in my hand and sets a baseline for subsequent bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since my hand doesn't have any 4s or higher digits in significant amounts, I'll increase the digit. Bidding 2 5s is a reasonable next step as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. The current bid is only 2 5s, so I can safely raise the quantity to 3 using my 9s. Bidding 3 9s is strictly higher in quantity than 2 5s and guaranteed true based on my cards.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand. While challenging is an option, the bid of 3 9s is below the average expected count (4.8 9s among 48 digits), making it a plausible bid. I need to bid higher than 3 9s. I have three 5s in my hand. Bidding 4 5s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and is well-supported by my hand, as I only need one more 5 to exist among the other 5 players (40 digits total), which is very likely. This seems like a safe and strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand (20239281). The current bid is 4 5s, which means there are at least 4 fives across all players. With 5 other players, it's possible but risky to challenge. I have a 9 in my hand, and the previous bid was 3 9s. Bidding 4 9s increases the quantity while keeping a high digit, which seems reasonable given the history.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand and no 9s. To outbid 4 9s I must bid quantity 5. Bidding 5 7s leverages my two known 7s, so I only need three more among the 40 unknown digits. The probability of at least three 7s in 40 draws (p=0.1) is about 0.78, which is higher than for any other digit. Therefore I bid 5 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. My hand contains two 7s, and with 6 players, it's plausible that others have additional 7s. Bidding 6 7s increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages the possibility that the total count of 7s could be higher than 5, while also maintaining a logical progression in the bidding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. My hand is 63461357, which contains two 7s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have two 7s, it's likely that the total count of 7s is at least 6 or more considering there are 5 other players. However, bidding 7 7s might be a bit too high without knowing others' hands. I can bid 6 8s, which is a higher digit with the same quantity, making it a reasonable and higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand and across 48 digits we expect only about 4–5 eights on average. A claim of 6 8s is unlikely (only around 20% probability), so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. With 40 digits total, we expect about 4 nines overall, and I already see 3. Bidding 4 9s is well-supported and as the highest digit it forces opponents to jump to quantity 5 if they want to overbid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. My hand contains three 5s and zero 9s. Bidding 5 5s is a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity (from 4 to 5). This bid is strongly supported by the three 5s in my hand, requiring only two more 5s from the remaining 32 digits among other players, which is a plausible scenario. Challenging 4 9s is risky as 4 is the expected count for any digit with 40 total digits, making the bid reasonably likely to be true. Bidding 5 5s leverages my hand strength and makes a reasonable increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand (20239281). The current bid is 5 5s, which means there would need to be at least four more 5s among the other four players' hands (total of 32 digits). Given that the previous round showed a low count of digits (e.g., only 2 8s when 6 were bid), it's unlikely there are five 5s in total. Challenging seems like the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round. My hand contains three 5s, which is a strong count for a single digit type. With 4 players and 32 total digits, the average count for any digit is 3.2. Bidding 4 5s is a credible opening bid that leverages my hand strength and is a plausible total count among the remaining players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I hold two 7s and the expected number of 7s among the other 24 digits is about 2.4, so bidding a total of 4 7s has a high chance of being correct (~70%). It’s the smallest raise above 4 5s and leverages my strong holding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 7s. The current bid is 4 7s. Assuming other players have at least two more 7s, the total could reach 4. Bidding 5 7s increases the quantity, maintaining the same digit, which is a logical progression. This strategy leverages the possibility of additional 7s in others' hands while adhering to the bid rules.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 7s in my hand. There are 24 unknown digits; the expected number of 7s is 2.4 and the probability of there being at least 5 is under 10%. The current bid of 5 7s is very unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand, so at least three 9s are guaranteed. Bidding 3 9s is the highest digit at quantity 3, forcing the next player to either raise to 4 of any digit or challenge and lose.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 2. My hand contains three 5s and zero 9s. Bidding 4 5s is a valid higher bid and is highly likely to be true, as it only requires one additional 5 among the 16 digits held by the other two players. This is a strong and safe move based on my hand, passing the turn to the next player.

Player 3 Reasoning: It is the start of a new round with 2 players and 16 total digits. I am Player 3 and it is my turn to make the first bid, as the current bid is 'None'. My hand is 40516552, which contains three 5s. With 16 total digits, the expected count of any digit is 1.6. Having three 5s is a strong hand for that digit. Bidding 4 5s means I need at least one 5 from Player 2's 8 digits, which is a reasonable expectation (probability of >= 1 five in 8 digits is 1 - (0.9)^8 ≈ 57%). This bid leverages my hand strength effectively and sets a good starting point.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand, so for Player 3’s bid of 4 5s to hold there must be at least three 5s in their 8 cards. Under a binomial(8,0.1) model that probability is only about 3.8%, making the bid extremely unlikely. I should challenge.
