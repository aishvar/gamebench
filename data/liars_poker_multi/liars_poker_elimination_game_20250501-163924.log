Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid. My hand contains two 5s and two 8s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, bidding 4 of a digit I hold multiple of is a reasonable and slightly confident starting bid. I will bid 4 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 73921022, which contains no 5s. The current bid is 4 5s by Player 0. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an average of about 4.8 of each digit is expected across all hands. A bid of 4 5s is slightly below average and plausible, but since I have none, I’m slightly skeptical. However, challenging now feels risky as it’s early in the round, and the bid isn’t excessively high. I’ll make a higher bid instead. My strongest digits are 2s with three in my hand. Bidding 5 2s increases the quantity and seems reasonable given my contribution of 3 towards that count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. Bidding higher than 5 2s is necessary. I have two 8s, so bidding 6 8s is a possible option. However, considering the total number of digits (48) and the previous bids, 5 2s already seems relatively high. Bidding 6 8s might be too aggressive. I can try to increase the quantity of the previous digit, 5, to 6, which would be 6 5s. I have one 5 in my hand, so that is a reasonable option. Alternatively, I can bid on a digit I have more of, like 8. I'll bid 6 8s, as it's a valid higher bid and I have two 8s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand, which makes bidding 6 9s a reasonable choice. This bid follows the rule of same quantity but higher digit compared to the current bid of 6 8s. Given that there are 48 digits total and I already hold three 9s, it's plausible that the remaining players collectively have at least three more 9s to meet the bid of 6.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I don't have any 9s in my hand. Bidding 7 0s is a safe option, as it's only slightly higher and doesn't rely on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. My hand is 58642408, which contains one 0. So, I have 1 zero. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 48 total digits and 7 0s are already bid, it's possible that the total count of 0s could be around 7 or slightly higher. However, given that I have one 0, it's reasonable to believe there could be around 7 or more 0s in total. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. A higher bid could be 8 0s or 7 1s. Given the information, bidding 7 1s seems reasonable as it increases the digit. Let's analyze: if I bid 8 0s, it might be too high because it implies more than 7 0s. On the other hand, bidding 7 1s is a safer bet as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit. My hand has two 1s and one 4, two 2s, one 5, one 6, and one 8. So, I can see that there are multiple digits represented. Bidding 7 1s seems like a good strategy.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s. With 48 total digits and an expected value of 4.8 for any specific digit, 7 is higher than average. My hand only contains one 1. For the bid to be true, the remaining 5 players (40 digits) would need to hold at least 6 more 1s. The probability of this occurring is less than the probability of them having 5 or fewer 1s, making the bid likely false. Challenging appears to be the statistically favorable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the start of the round, and I am the first bidder. My hand contains two 5s and two 8s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. Bidding '4 5s' is a standard, non-bluffing starting bid that matches the average expectation and is supported by having two 5s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 73921022, which contains two 2s, one 0, one 1, one 3, one 7, and one 9, but no 5s. The current bid is 4 5s by Player 0. With 40 total digits across 5 players, a bid of 4 5s is plausible as it represents only 10% of the total digits, and I have none myself, so they could be distributed among others. Challenging now feels risky without stronger evidence of a bluff. Instead, I will make a higher bid. Since I have two 2s, bidding on 2s feels safe. I can bid 5 2s, which is higher than 4 5s by increasing the quantity. This is a reasonable escalation based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. The previous round saw a challenge succeed when a bid of 7 1s was made with only 3 present. While 5 2s is lower than 7 1s, it's still a significant claim with 40 total digits remaining. Given my hand and the prior challenge success, challenging seems like the best option. It's unlikely that 5 players each have at least one 2, and some may have more.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet in the current round and I am starting the bidding, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand is 73921022, which gives me two 2s. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 4 2s seems reasonable as it accounts for my two 2s and assumes at least two more among the other players, which is plausible. This bid sets a moderate starting point without overcommitting.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. Bidding 4 9s is reasonable because it's a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit than 2s) and my three 9s make it likely that the total count meets or exceeds 4. This leverages my strong position in 9s while forcing opponents to respond.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, which is a safe but potentially weak bid. However, since the game has progressed to 4 players, the total number of digits is only 32. Bidding 4 9s implies that the other three players have at least zero 9s. It's plausible, but I think there's a decent chance the bid is too high. I will challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand, which is a significant portion of the total 24 digits in play. Bidding 4 9s leverages my strong holding and assumes at least one additional 9 exists among the other two players (16 digits total). This bid is conservative yet aggressive enough to pressure opponents, as the total count of 4 is likely achievable given my hand's composition.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. My hand (15856980) contains two 5s and two 8s. With 24 total digits among 3 players, the average expected count for any digit is 2.4. Bidding 5 5s requires 3 additional 5s from the other 16 digits (average expectation from 16 digits is 1.6), which is plausible. This bid is valid as it's higher than 4 9s (higher quantity). It's well-supported by my hand and is a reasonable progression, especially considering I bid 4 5s in previous rounds. Challenging 4 9s is risky as Player 3 likely has multiple 9s to support their bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 73921022, so I have two 2s, one 7, one 3, one 9, one 1, and two 0s. The current bid is 5 5s by Player 0. I have no 5s in my hand, which means for the bid to be true, the other two players must have at least 5 5s between them (out of their 16 total digits). This seems somewhat unlikely, but not impossible. However, since the total digits are 24, and considering past bidding patterns where bids around 4 or 5 have been challenged with mixed results, I think it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I’ll bid 5 9s, as I have one 9, and it’s plausible that there could be more 9s among the other players, given Player 3 previously bid 4 9s. This bid increases the digit while maintaining the quantity, making it a valid higher bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 9s and three 6s in my hand. The current bid of 5 9s requires at least two more 9s across two players, which is possible but uncertain. Bidding 6 6s leverages my three 6s and follows the strict increase rule, as 6 of any digit is the next valid bid after 5 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s, made by Player 3. There are 3 players remaining, each with 8 digits, for a total of 24 digits. My hand contains one 6. For the bid of 6 6s to be true, there must be at least 5 more 6s among the remaining 16 digits held by Player 1 and Player 3. This requires a concentration of 6s (5 out of 16, or 31.25%) that is significantly higher than the random expectation (10%). While Player 3 might have multiple 6s, this quantity feels aggressive. Bidding higher, either by quantity (7+) or a higher digit at quantity 6 (6 7s, 6 8s, 6 9s), also requires a high concentration of digits from the remaining players, and my hand doesn't strongly support such a high bid (max 2 of any digit). Challenging the current bid of 6 6s appears to be the most strategic move, as the probability of the actual count being less than 6 seems higher than it being 6 or more.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 73921022, so I have two 2s, and no 5s. The current bid by Player 0 is 3 5s, which means they are claiming there are at least three 5s across our combined 16 digits. Since I have no 5s, for the bid to be true, Player 0 must have at least three 5s in their 8 digits, which is possible but not guaranteed. However, challenging now is risky because the likelihood of three 5s in 16 digits is reasonable (about 30% chance if digits are random). Instead, I can make a safer bid. I have two 2s, so bidding 4 2s is plausible if Player 0 has at least two 2s. But to be more conservative and increase the digit, I’ll bid 3 6s, which is a higher bid than 3 5s. This keeps the quantity the same but raises the digit, and it's a reasonable guess since I don’t have any 6s, but Player 0 could have some.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s by Player 1. There are 16 total digits across two players. The expected number of any specific digit is 1.6 (16 / 10). A bid of 3 6s is significantly above this expectation. The probability of having 3 or more 6s among 16 random digits is approximately 21%. This means there is about a 79% chance that the actual count of 6s is less than 3. Challenging this bid offers a high probability of winning and eliminating Player 1.
