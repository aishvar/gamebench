Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the start of the round, and I am the first bidder. My hand contains two 8s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected count of any specific digit is around 4.8. Based on my two 8s, the expected total count of 8s across all players is 2 (mine) + (5 players * 8 digits/player * 1/10 probability) = 2 + 4 = 6. Bidding 6 8s is a reasonable starting bid that aligns with the expected total count given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to assess the likelihood of there being 6 or more 8s among all players. First, I'll check my own hand: 85245131. I have zero 8s in my hand. The current bid is 6 8s made by Player 0. With 6 players total and 8 digits per player, there are 48 total digits. For the bid to be valid, Player 0 and the other 4 players would need to have at least 6 8s among them. While this is possible, it seems somewhat unlikely that Player 0 would open with such a specific bid unless they had several 8s themselves. However, it's not extreme enough to warrant an immediate challenge. I should make a higher bid. I could bid 7 8s, but that's risky since I have no 8s. I could bid 6 9s (same quantity, higher digit), but I have no 9s either. A safer option would be to bid on a digit I actually have in my hand. I have two 1s, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, and one 8. I'll bid 7 1s, increasing the quantity but choosing a digit I have multiple of in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s. The expected number of any digit across all 48 cards is 4.8. I have zero 1s in my hand (42432323). This means the remaining 40 digits held by the other 5 players must contain at least seven 1s. The expected number of 1s in those 40 digits is 4. While 7 is higher than average, it's not impossibly high, making a challenge risky. I have three 2s and three 3s. Bidding 7 2s requires only four 2s among the other 40 digits, which matches the statistical average (40/10 = 4). This is a plausible bid based on my hand and safer than challenging the 7 1s bid or making a higher quantity bid at this stage.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 56825230. I have two 2s. The current bid is 7 2s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4.8. A bid of 7 2s is slightly above average, but not outrageously high, especially since I hold two 2s.  However, Player 1 bid 7 1s just before Player 2 bid 7 2s. Bidding 7 2s immediately after a bid of 7 1s seems slightly suspicious, as it's a very small increment in digit.  Given I have two 2s, I could potentially bid higher on 2s, but increasing to 8 2s might be too risky with 6 players. I also have two 5s, a 6, an 8, a 3, and a 0.  Looking at the previous bids (6 8s, 7 1s), a bid of 8 on any digit seems plausible. Bidding 8 0s is a safe increase in quantity. Alternatively, bidding 8 3s is also an option as I have a 3. Bidding 8 0s is a safer play as 0s are generally less bid upon early.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, so the bid of 8 zeros requires at least six more 0s among the other 40 cards. The probability of that is only about 21%, making the bid unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand and expect about 3.2 more among the 32 unknown digits, for a total around 5.2. A bid of 4 6s is conservative and credible as an opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:3 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s by Player 4. The minimum possible total 6s is 2 (my hand), and the bid claims at least 4. Since there are 5 players, it's plausible others have 2 more 6s, but without evidence, this is uncertain. Challenging the bid of 4 6s is risky but potentially rewarding: if actual count is less than 4 (which is possible given my hand), I win and eliminate Player 4. Bidding higher would require assuming others have more 6s, which is equally uncertain. Challenging is the most direct way to test the validity of the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I hold two 6s and expect about 2.4 more from the other 24 unknown digits, giving an expected total of ~4.4. Bidding 4 6s has roughly a 70% chance of success while putting forward a strong opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand contains zero 6s. With 32 total digits remaining, the average count for any digit is 3.2. A bid of 4 is slightly above average but not impossible. However, Player 4 just won a challenge on 4 6s in the previous round. While Player 5's hand is now removed, Player 4 may still hold a significant number of 6s, making a challenge risky. My hand contains two 8s. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is supported by my hand; I need only two more 8s from the remaining 24 digits, which is a reasonable expectation (average 2.4 per digit). Making a supported bid seems safer than challenging based on the previous round's history.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 0. Looking at my hand (85245131), I have one 8. With 32 total digits in play and 4 active players, the average distribution would be 3.2 of each digit. Since I have one 8, there would need to be 3 more 8s among the other three players for the bid to be valid. This is quite possible. I could challenge, but it's risky given the reasonable nature of the bid. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have two 1s in my hand, which increases my confidence in bidding on 1s. I could bid 5 1s, which is higher than 4 8s by increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 4 9s, which is higher by increasing the digit. Since I have no 9s in my hand, I'll go with 5 1s based on what I know I have.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have zero 1s in my hand (42432323). This means the other 3 players (24 digits) must have at least five 1s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 1s in those 24 digits is 2.4 (24 * 1/10). While 5 is higher than expected, it's not an impossible bid early in the round. Challenging is an option. However, I have a strong hand for bidding higher. I hold three 2s and three 3s. Bidding 5 2s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). With three 2s already in my hand, I only need two more 2s among the other 24 digits. The expected number of 2s in those digits is 2.4, making this a statistically safe and plausible bid. Bidding 5 2s leverages my hand strength and passes the pressure to the next player without taking the immediate risk of a challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have no 2s in my hand and there are 24 unknown digits among the other players. Even if digits are uniformly distributed (mean ≈2.4 twos), the chance of seeing five or more 2s in the other hands is under 10%. The bid of “5 2s” is highly unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With 24 total digits the expected count of any digit is about 2.4, so there’s a high chance of at least one more 6 among the other 16 cards. Opening with 3 6s is a low yet reasonable bid that I’m likely to win if challenged.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. My hand contains zero 6s, making a challenge risky as the other players might have them. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is plausible, requiring only one additional 8 from the remaining 16 digits held by other players. This seems like a safe and strategic move based on my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The current bid is 3 8s from Player 0. Looking at my hand (85245131), I have one 8. If Player 0 has at least one 8 (which seems likely given their bid), and if Player 4 has at least one 8, then the total would be at least 3 8s, making the current bid reasonable. I could bid 3 9s, but there's no 9 in my hand, making it risky. I could bid 4 0s, but I don't have any 0s either. Looking at my hand, I have three 1s, which is a strong position. I could bid 4 1s, which would be higher than the current bid and supported by my hand. This seems like a reasonable move given what I know.
