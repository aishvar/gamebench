Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. With 48 total digits, each digit appears on average 4.8 times, so it’s very likely the other players hold at least two more 2s (about a 92% chance). Bidding 4 2s is a safe and reasonable opening bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand and no 2s. The current bid of 4 2s is roughly at the expected count, so challenging is risky. Bidding 4 3s is the minimal raise and with an expected ~4.8 total 3s, needing two more among the other 40 cards has ~92% chance of success.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have the digits 6, 4, 8, 4, 0, 2, 5, 2 in my hand. Counting the 3s: I have no 3s, so the actual count of 3s is likely low. To beat 4 3s, I would need to bid at least 5 3s, which I cannot do because I have zero 3s. Challenging seems appropriate since the bid is unlikely to be truthful.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I hold three 1s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits and an average of 3.2 ones, it's very likely there is at least one more. Starting with a bid of 4 1s leverages my strong holding while remaining safe.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s made by Player 1. I have two 1s in my hand. Considering there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are 40 digits in total. With my two 1s, I need at least two more 1s in the other players' hands to make the current bid of 4 1s valid. Given that the bid is only 4 1s, it seems plausible. However, I can increase the quantity while choosing a digit that I have in my hand. Bidding 5 2s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and uses a digit I have.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have two 2s in my hand, which is not enough to make a higher bid with the same digit. However, I have one 6 and one 9, which could potentially be used to make a higher bid with a different digit. Considering the total digits remaining (40) and the current bid, I should aim to increase the digit to 9, as it is the highest possible digit. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable move, increasing the digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have 9, 3, and 8 in my hand. The current bid is 5 2s. I can make a bid with a higher quantity by bidding 6 2s or a higher digit by bidding at least 3 9s. However, I have no 9s in my hand, so I'll bid a higher quantity with the digit 2.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. I have one '2' in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid but does not strongly confirm it. To make a valid higher bid, I must either increase the quantity to 7 or keep the quantity at 6 and increase the digit to at least 3. I have one '1', one '4', one '5', one '7', and one '9' in my hand. Bidding 6 3s is a reasonable next step since it's the lowest valid increase and digit 3 is not in my hand, but it is plausible given the total digits. Bidding 7 1s is also possible but riskier since '1' is less than '2' in digit order. Therefore, I will bid 6 3s to keep the bid reasonable and pressure the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have only one 3 in my hand. There are 32 unknown digits, and the expected number of 3s there is about 3.2, making the chance of seeing at least 5 more (for a total of 6) only around 20%. It’s unlikely the bid of 6 3s is true, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. With four players and 32 total digits, the expected count of any digit is about 3.2, so bidding 3 2s is reasonable: I only need one more among the other 24 cards, which is highly likely.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand and the current bid is 3 2s. By bidding 3 3s, I only need one more 3 among the 24 unknown cards. The probability of at least one additional 3 exceeds 90%, making this a safe minimal raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s made by Player 1. My hand contains two 7s and one 2, and other digits appear once or not at all. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 32 total digits remaining, I should consider the feasibility of the current bid and my own hand. Since my goal is to either make a valid higher bid or challenge, I notice that bidding higher than 3 3s requires either a higher quantity or a higher digit. I have two 7s, so bidding 3 7s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and my hand supports it.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have a 7 in my hand, so I can bid 4 7s, increasing the quantity. This is a reasonable bid as it's not extremely high, and I have one digit to base it on.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. Among the 24 unknown digits, the chance of seeing three or more additional 7s (to make at least four total) is only about 43.5%, so the bid of 4 7s is unlikely and challenging has a better than 56% success rate.

Player 1 Reasoning: I hold three 1s in my hand. To beat the current bid of 2 9s I must raise the quantity to at least 3. Bidding 3 1s is a valid raise and guaranteed to be true since I have all three.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s made by Player 1. I have 8 secret digits: 01727215. I see that I have three 1s in my hand. Given that there are only 3 active players and 24 total digits remaining, the bid of 3 1s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. Since my hand contains three 1s and I know there are 24 digits in total, I should consider if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand, so bidding 4 1s is plausible. It strictly beats the current bid of 3 9s by increasing the quantity, and with 16 unseen cards the chance of at least one more 1 is high (~82%).

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is '4 1s' made by Player 1. I have one 1 in my hand. Given that there are 24 total digits remaining across 3 players, the maximum possible count for any digit is 24. However, considering the bids and my hand, I have two 2s and two 7s. The bid of '4 1s' seems plausible but I can try to make a higher bid. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 2s, bidding '4 2s' seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to '4 1s'.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s, which is a relatively low digit. I have a 9 in my hand, and since the digit is low, I can safely increase the digit to 9, which I have in my hand. I also have a 9 in my hand, so I can increase the quantity to 2, which is higher than the current bid quantity. I will make a bid of 2 9s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s made by Player 1. I, Player 3, have two 1s and two 2s in my hand. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, I should consider the possibility of challenging or bidding conservatively. However, since my goal is to either make a valid higher bid or challenge, I notice that bidding a higher quantity or digit is feasible. I have 2 '1's, so the total could be at least 4 if Player 1 has 2 '1's as well. Bidding 4 1s seems reasonable as it accounts for my digits and puts pressure on Player 1.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand. To meet Player 3’s bid of 4 1s he must have at least one 1 in his eight cards, which has probability 1–0.9^8 ≈ 57%.
