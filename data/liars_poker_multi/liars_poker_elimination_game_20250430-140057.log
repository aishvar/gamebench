Player 0 Reasoning: It is the first bid of the round, and there is no current bid. I need to make a valid starting bid. My hand contains two 5s and two 6s. Bidding '3 5s' is a conservative and reasonable starting bid based on having two 5s in my hand and expecting at least one more 5 among the other 5 players (40 digits total).

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand, which is higher than the current bid's digit (5). However, the current bid is 3 5s. Since I don't have any 5s, but I have a higher digit (7, 9), I can either bid a higher quantity with a lower digit or the same quantity with a higher digit. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it maintains the quantity but increases the digit, which is a valid move.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. The current bid of 3 6s is below the average expected count of 4.8 for any digit, making it risky to challenge. Bidding 4 4s leverages my own holdings and follows the average expectation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (48525361), I have one 4. Player 2 has bid '4 4s', suggesting there are at least 4 fours among all players. With 6 players having 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. The probability of having 4s is reasonable - on average, we'd expect about 4.8 fours total (48 digits Ã— 1/10 chance of being a 4). Since I already have one 4 in my hand, there need to be at least 3 more 4s among the other 40 digits from other players. This seems quite plausible. I could bid 5 4s, but that's riskier. I could also bid 4 5s (same quantity, higher digit) since I have two 5s in my hand, which increases my confidence. I'll go with 4 5s as it's a safer bid based on my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. Increasing the digit to 7 at the same quantity is a valid move. Given the bid of 4 6s might be reasonable, bidding 4 7s is a cautious but valid escalation based on my hand and the bid history.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average expected count for any digit is 4.8. A bid of 4 7s is plausible. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Challenging 4 7s means I believe there are 3 or fewer 7s in total. Since I have one 7, this means I believe the other 5 players have 2 or fewer 7s. The expected number of 7s among the other 40 digits is 4, so challenging is risky. Looking at my hand (73565860), I have two 5s and two 6s. Bidding 5 of any digit is a valid higher bid. Bidding 5 5s or 5 6s is well supported by my hand, as I contribute 2 towards the bid. Bidding 5 5s seems like a strong, plausible bid given my hand and the game state, requiring 3 more 5s from the other 5 players (expected 4).

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 5 5s, which means there must be at least four more 5s among the other five players' hands (since I have one). Given that the bid history shows increasing bids on 5s, it's possible that other players also have 5s. However, bidding 6 5s would be risky as it requires five more 5s from other players. Instead, I can increase the digit to 6s, but I only have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 5 6s would be a safer increase, as it's possible there are more 6s in other players' hands based on previous bids.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid of 5 6s is slightly above the average expected count of 4.8 for any digit. Bidding 5 7s leverages my own 7 and follows the bid hierarchy (same quantity, higher digit). Since the average supports 5 as a plausible count for 7s, this bid balances risk and strategic progression.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (48525361), I have one 7. The current bid is 5 7s across all players' hands. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. For the bid to be valid, there need to be at least 5 sevens total. I have 1, so there would need to be at least 4 more among the other 5 players. That's certainly possible. I could either make a higher bid or challenge. Given that I have two 5s in my hand, I might bid 6 5s, but that seems risky as it's a high quantity. I could bid 5 8s, which is safer as I have one 8 in my hand. I could also bid 6 0s, 6 1s, 6 2s, 6 3s, 6 4s, or 6 6s, but I don't have many of those digits in my hand. I'll go with 5 8s as it's a safer bid given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s, which is quite high considering the total digits are 48. I have no 8s in my hand, which makes the bid less likely. However, I do have one 7 in my hand and the previous bid by Player 5 was 4 7s. To raise the bid, I must increase the quantity or the digit. The next higher bid after 6 8s would be 7 0s since 7 is greater than 6, and digit resets from 9 to 0. Bidding 7 0s is a significant jump and risky but possible. Given the high bid and my hand, challenging might be safer, but I will bid 7 0s to push the game forward and test others' confidence.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits. The expected number of any single digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8. A bid of 7 is significantly above this average. My hand contains only one 0. For the bid of 7 0s to be true, there must be at least 6 more 0s among the other 5 players (40 digits). While possible, this is a high concentration (6 out of 40 vs. expected 4 out of 40). Bidding higher would require bidding 7 of a digit higher than 0 or 8+ of any digit. My hand (73565860) has at most two of any digit (two 5s, two 6s), making a bid of 7 or 8 of any digit risky. Given the high quantity bid (7) relative to the average and my hand's composition, challenging the current bid of 7 0s appears to be the most strategic move, as it is statistically less likely to be true than a lower bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this new round, and the current bid is 'None'. I have two 5s and two 6s in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s, which seems plausible given that there are 4 other players who could have 5s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. With 5 players remaining and 40 total digits, the expected count for any digit is 4. Since I have no 6s in my hand, challenging would risk facing a valid bid (as 3 is below the average). Bidding 4 4s leverages my two 4s, making it plausible to reach 4 total 4s across all hands. This bid increases the quantity, forcing opponents to either raise further or challenge a bid that aligns with statistical expectations.

With 5 players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. I need to decide if I should challenge or make a higher bid. Since I have one 4 in my hand, there would need to be at least 3 more 4s among the other 4 players, which is quite possible (less than 1 per player on average). I also have two 5s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid '4 5s' - this is higher than '4 4s' because it's the same quantity but a higher digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand (48525361). With 3 players having 8 digits each, there are 24 total digits in play. Player 0 has bid 3 5s, claiming there are at least 3 fives total. Since I already have 2 fives, this bid is very likely to be true - Player 0 only needs to have 1 five in their hand, or Player 4 needs to have at least 1 five. Looking at previous rounds, Player 0 has consistently bid on 5s and won challenges about 5s, suggesting they likely have some 5s in their hand. I should make a higher bid. I could bid 3 6s (same quantity, higher digit) or 4 5s (higher quantity, same digit). Since I have one 6 in my hand, bidding 3 6s is safer, but bidding 4 5s puts pressure on the other players and might be more strategic given my two 5s.

Player 4 Reasoning: Considering my hand (42890668), I have 2 sixes, which is more than the current bid of 3 6s. I can increase the quantity to 4 to make a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand contains two 5s and two 6s. With 24 total digits, the average count for any digit is 2.4. A bid of 4 6s, given I hold two, means the other two players need a combined total of at least two 6s from their 16 digits, which is quite plausible. Challenging seems risky as the bid isn't excessively high. Bidding higher is necessary. Based on my hand, bidding 5 on either 5s or 6s is the most reasonable quantity increase. I have two 5s, so bidding 5 5s requires the other two players to have three or more 5s combined from 16 digits. I also have two 6s, so bidding 5 6s requires them to have three or more 6s combined. Bidding 5 5s uses my hand strength and is a valid, plausible bid that increases the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (48525361), I have 2 fives. The current bid is 5 5s made by Player 0. For this to be true, there would need to be 3 more fives between Player 0 and Player 4's hands. This is possible but getting risky. Player 0 has successfully defended 5 5s twice in previous rounds, which suggests they likely have some 5s in their hand. However, the game state has changed - we now have only 3 players with 8 digits each, so there are fewer total digits. I could bid 5 6s (same quantity, higher digit) or 6 5s (higher quantity), but I only have one 6 in my hand, making 5 6s risky. I could also challenge, but given Player 0's history of successful 5 5s bids, this seems risky too. I'll bid 6 4s since I have two 4s in my hand, which gives me more confidence in this bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid of 6 4s by Player 3 seems reasonable, but I can improve it by increasing the digit to 6. With only 24 total digits remaining, bidding 6 6s is a reasonable and higher bid, as it's the same quantity as the current bid but with a higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s, made by Player 4. There are 24 total digits across 3 players. I hold two 6s. For the bid to be true, the other two players must hold at least 4 more 6s among their combined 16 digits. The probability of finding 4 or more specific digits in 16 random digits is low (approximately 7% based on a binomial distribution B(16, 0.1)). While the bidding history suggests Player 3 and Player 4 might hold some 6s, a bid of 6 6s is still significantly higher than the expected total count (2.4). Bidding higher than 6 6s would require claiming an even larger number of digits, and based on my hand (only one 7, one 8, zero 9s, and two 5s/6s), any higher bid (like 6 7s or 7 5s) would require an even more improbable concentration of digits from the other players' hands (needing 5+ of that digit from 16). Challenging the current bid appears to be the less risky move given the high quantity claimed relative to the total digits and the low probability of the remaining 6s being present.

Player 0 Reasoning: It is the start of a new round with 2 players and 16 total digits. I am the first bidder, so the current bid is 'None'. My hand is 73565860, which contains two 5s and two 6s. Based on my hand and the history of previous rounds where I started with '3 5s', bidding '3 5s' is a consistent and reasonable opening move. This implies I believe there are at least three 5s in total between the two players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (48525361), I have two 5s. Player 0 has bid 3 5s, meaning they believe there are at least 3 fives total between our hands. Since I already have 2 fives, their bid is very reasonable and likely true. Based on previous rounds, Player 0 seems to favor bidding on 5s, which might indicate they have some in their hand. I could safely bid 3 6s (I have one 6 in my hand) or increase the quantity to 4 5s (risky since that would mean Player 0 needs to have at least 2 fives). I could also bid on a digit I have more of, like 3 3s (I have one 3) or 3 2s (I have one 2). Since I have one 6 in my hand, bidding 3 6s seems like the safest option that advances the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 3. My hand is 73565860, which contains two 5s and two 6s. Challenging 3 6s is risky as Player 3 likely has at least one 6. I need to make a higher bid. Bidding 4 5s is a valid higher bid. It requires a total of four 5s. Since I have two 5s, Player 3 would need to have at least two 5s in their 8 digits. While statistically unlikely (probability of >= 2 5s in 8 digits is ~19%), it is a plausible bid leveraging my hand strength in 5s and is a standard way to increase the quantity.

Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (48525361), I have two 5s. Player 0 has bid 4 5s, claiming there are at least 4 fives total between our hands. Since I have 2 fives, for their bid to be true, they would need to have at least 2 fives in their hand. This is certainly possible. I could challenge, but there's a significant risk their bid is accurate. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have one 6 in my hand, so I could bid 4 6s (same quantity, higher digit). I also have two 8s, which gives me confidence to bid 5 8s (higher quantity, higher digit). The 5 8s bid seems stronger based on my hand composition.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s by Player 3. There are 16 total digits between the two players. I hold one 8 in my hand. For Player 3's bid to be true, they would need to hold at least four 8s in their 8-digit hand (1 + 4 = 5). The probability of a player having 4 or more of a specific digit in 8 random digits is quite low. Given the low likelihood of Player 3 holding that many 8s, challenging the bid is the most favorable action.
