Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have my 8 digits: 50071446. Looking at my hand, I see: two 4s, two 0s, one 5, one 1, one 6, one 7. Since I'm opening the bidding, I should start conservatively but with confidence based on what I know. Given I have two 4s in my hand, it's reasonable to estimate there might be around 8-10 4s total across all players. A safe opening bid would be '5 4s' since I already know of two 4s and it's a moderate digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have two 4s in my hand, but the total count across all players could be higher. Bidding 5 5s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages the possibility that other players may have 5s, and it avoids directly challenging the current bid without sufficient evidence.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 5 5s. Bidding 5 6s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, making it a valid higher bid. Since I hold one 6, it's plausible other players have enough 6s to meet this bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: As the first bidder in the round, I need to set an initial bid based on my hand. My hand contains two 4s and two 1s. Bidding 5 4s is reasonable because I have two, and it's plausible others have additional 4s. This bid is conservative yet allows room for escalation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains two 6s (digits: 6,6). With 40 digits in play, a bid of 5 4s is not particularly high. I can safely increase the digit to 5s while keeping the quantity at 5, which is the minimal valid raise. This keeps my options open and doesn't overcommit.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:3 - o3-2025-04-16) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Across 5 players there are 40 digits. I can see one 5 in my own hand. That leaves 32 unknown digits. With a uniform 10-digit distribution, the expected number of 5s in those 32 digits is 3.2. The probability that there are at least 4 more 5s (so the total reaches the bid of five) is a bit under 40%. That means there is roughly a 60% chance the actual count is below five. Those odds are good enough to risk a challenge rather than raising to an even riskier bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I’m the first to act this round. I hold two 3s. With 32 digits in play, the expected number of any given digit is a bit over three, so asserting three 3s is highly probable (I need just one more 3 among the remaining 24 unknown digits). It’s a safe opening bid that shouldn’t be immediately challenged and leaves room for future raises.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 3. With 4 active players and 8 digits each (32 total), the bid of 3 3s is quite reasonable. Given my hand also contains two 4s, I can safely bid '3 4s' which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This is a conservative move that builds on my known cards while maintaining credibility.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s, which requires at least three 4s in total. Since I already have two, it's plausible there's at least one more 4 among the other players. However, bidding 3 5s (same quantity, higher digit) is a valid and strategic move to increase the stakes without overcommitting. Challenging would risk losing if the bid is accurate.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:0 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains two 4s. The current bid is 3 5s. Bidding 4 4s increases the quantity (4 > 3) and leverages my two 4s. The expected total 4s across all players is 4.4 (2 in my hand + 2.4 in others), making this bid plausible. Challenging the 3 5s bid is riskier, as the expected total 5s is ~3.4 (1 in my hand + 2.4 in others), which is just above the bid. Bidding 4 4s is a safer, higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:3 - o3-2025-04-16) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have zero 4s in my eight-digit hand. That means all four 4s would have to come from the 24 unknown digits. With a 10% expected frequency per digit, the chance of seeing at least four 4s in 24 digits is only about 22%. That means roughly a 78% chance the bid is wrong. Those odds strongly favor challenging rather than making a shaky higher bid based on digits I don’t hold.

Player 2 Reasoning: As the starting bidder, I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 3 4s is a conservative and plausible opening bid, considering the total digits in play (24). This allows for one additional 4 in opponents' hands and sets a low threshold to defend.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. The current bid of 3 4s by Player 2 is quite conservative given that I alone have two 4s. Based on the game history, Player 2 has shown good accuracy in their bids, and they've started with a relatively low bid this round. Since I know there must be at least 2 fours (from my hand), bidding 4 4s is a safe play that forces other players to either go higher or challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains three 7s. The current bid is 4 4s. Bidding 4 7s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my known cards to propose a plausible claim.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s, which requires at least four 7s across all players. Given that I have none, the remaining two players must account for all four. With 16 digits between them, this is possible but statistically unlikely (expected ~2.4 7s total). Challenging this bid offers a reasonable chance to expose a potential bluff, especially since Player 1's bid may not be supported by their hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains three 7s, which is a strong foundation for a bid. Since the current bid is None, starting with 3 7s leverages my known cards and sets a reasonable baseline. This bid is both quantitatively and digit-wise justified by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand of 50071446. With only 2 players remaining and 16 total digits, the opponent must have two 7s for their bid of '3 7s' to be true. While possible, this seems unlikely given they would be revealing a lot of information about their hand. Additionally, their previous successful bid of '4 7s' in the last round (when there were 24 total digits) suggests they might be bluffing now. Based on this, challenging seems like the best option.
