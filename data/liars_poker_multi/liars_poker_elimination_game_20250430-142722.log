Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 1s. Since there's no current bid, starting with a bid that reflects my hand's composition makes sense. Bidding 2 1s is a logical first move based on my cards.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. Bidding 3 1s would be risky as it relies entirely on other players having 1s. I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s is a reasonable option, increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 2 2s, but 3 8s feels slightly stronger given my hand. Therefore, I will bid 3 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.  A bid of 3 8s is slightly below average, but not unreasonable given the limited history.  However, I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 4 3s is a stronger bid than 3 8s and is supported by my hand, increasing the quantity based on my holdings. It's a safer bid than increasing the 8s count.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s, and I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 4 4s would be a valid increase in digit with the same quantity, but I have no 4s in my hand. Instead, I can bid 4 6s, increasing the digit and having one 6 in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 6, making the current bid of 4 6s plausible (needing ~3 more 6s among 40 unknown cards, ~78% chance). Itâ€™s not worth challenging. The next valid raise is 4 7s, 4 8s, or 4 9s. I hold one 9, so bidding 4 9s only requires 3 more 9s (~78% chance), making it a minimal, credible raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 9s. Given that there are 48 total digits and five other players, it's plausible there is at least one more 9 in the remaining hands. Bidding 5 9s increases the quantity while maintaining the digit, which is a reasonable escalation based on my holdings and statistical likelihood.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, and with 48 total digits across all players, the probability of there being at least 5 9s is low. Since I can't confirm the presence of additional 9s in other players' hands, challenging the bid is a reasonable risk to take.

Player 5 Reasoning: As the first to bid, I need to start with a reasonable bid. My hand contains three 9s, so bidding 4 9s is plausible. This accounts for my three 9s plus at least one more from other players. Starting with a moderate bid based on my own digits reduces risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Given the previous round's outcome where a bid of 5 9s was successful (though challenged and won), 4 9s seems plausible. However, with only 5 players and 40 total digits, the probability of 4 or more 9s is not extremely high. I will attempt to increase the bid slightly, hoping to bluff. I have two 8s, so bidding 5 8s is a reasonable, yet risky, move. It's higher than the current bid and could potentially succeed if other players also lack 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains one 8. The current bid is 5 8s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, the average number of any digit is 40 / 10 = 4.  A bid of 5 8s is slightly above average, but not outrageously so, especially since Player 1 might have multiple 8s.  I need to bid higher than 5 8s. I have two 3s and one 9. Bidding 6 of any digit seems too high given the current bid and my hand. Bidding 5 of a higher digit is the most conservative valid move. I have a 9, so bidding 5 9s is a possibility, although Player 5 just bid 4 9s. Bidding 5 9s is a valid increase and seems more plausible than bidding 6 of any digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. To bid higher, I must bid either a higher quantity or the same quantity but a higher digit. The next valid bids after 5 9s would be 6 0s or higher, since digit 9 is the highest digit. I have only one 9 in my hand and one 3, 2 1s, and some other digits, but no 0s. However, bidding 6 0s might be risky but plausible given the total of 40 digits. Bidding 6 0s is the smallest increment and the safest higher bid. Challenging 5 9s is risky because the previous round showed 6 9s existed, so 5 9s is plausible. Therefore, I will bid 6 0s.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two zeros in my hand. To meet the bid of six zeros, the other 32 cards need at least four zeros, but the expected number of zeros among them is 3.2 with a standard deviation of about 1.7, making four or more unlikely (<50%). Therefore I should challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: It's the start of the round with no bids yet. I have two 1s and one 3 and one 0 in my hand among other digits. Starting with a moderate bid is strategic to set the pace. I will begin with a bid of 2 1s, which is safe and based on my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains three 9s. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid than 2 1s. Even if other players have no 9s, the total count (3) meets the bid. This leverages my strong digit count while minimizing risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Given that there are only 32 digits remaining across 4 players (8 digits each), and a 9s bid was previously successful at 5, a bid of 3 seems reasonable to attempt to increase. I will bid 4 0s, as I have two 0s and it represents a higher quantity than the previous bid. This is a calculated risk, as 4 0s is plausible.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. My hand contains one 9, one 2, one 4, two 3s, one 6, one 1, and one 8. I have two 3s. A bid of 5 3s is a valid higher bid than 4 0s (higher quantity) and is plausible given I have two 3s and there are 32 total digits. Challenging 4 0s is also an option, but with 32 digits, four 0s is not an extremely high bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s, and I need to make a higher bid. My hand has one '3'. Considering that 5 of the digit '3' might be plausible given 32 total digits, but to raise, I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since 5 4s would be a higher bid and I have one '4' in my hand, bidding 5 4s is reasonable and keeps the bid believable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. For the bid to be true, the remaining three players must have at least four 4s among their 24 digits. Given that 4s are not extremely rare, but the bid is relatively low (5 total), it's plausible but not guaranteed. However, since I only have one 4, the burden of proof is on the bidder (Player 3) to justify the claim. Challenging is a reasonable risk here, as the probability of exactly 5 4s being distributed across all players is uncertain, and the bid may be a bluff.

Player 5 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make a reasonable opening bid. My hand contains three 9s, which gives me a strong foundation to bid on 9s. Bidding 4 9s is plausible since I have three, and there are two other players who might each have at least one 9. This bid is conservative yet leverages my hand's strength.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Given that only 24 total digits remain across three players (8 each), and we've already had a round where 5 9s was challenged and won, 4 9s seems plausible, but not overwhelmingly so. However, I have two 8s, and bidding 5 8s would be a reasonable increase, given my hand. Alternatively, I could bid 4 of another digit I have, but that doesn't seem strategically advantageous. Since I have no 9s, I'm inclined to challenge, but I'll consider the risk. The previous challenges were successful when the bid was very high. Since 4 9s isn't an absurdly high bid, I'll challenge it.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. Starting the bid with 4 9s is reasonable because it's a slight increase from my own count and leverages the high frequency of 9s in previous successful bids.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. With 16 total digits, the average count of any digit is 1.6. A bid of 4 9s is higher than average. However, I know there is at least one 9. Player 5 made this bid, and they won a challenge on 4 9s previously when there were 24 digits. They might have a few 9s. Bidding 5 9s is a slight increase and plausible if Player 5 has a couple of 9s. Bidding on another digit, like 5 3s (I have two 3s), would be a higher quantity bid which is a bigger jump.
