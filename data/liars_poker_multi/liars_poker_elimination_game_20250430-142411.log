Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I should make a safe opening bid based on my hand. I have one 1, one 3, one 5, one 6, two 7s, and two 8s. Since I have two 7s and two 8s, starting with '2 7s' or '2 8s' is reasonable, but many players open with '2 1s' or '2 0s' as those are common digits across all hands. However, since I hold two 7s and two 8s, opening with '2 7s' gives me a strong position.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, but with 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total), having just 2 sevens across all players is quite possible. Since I have two 8s in my hand, I can confidently bid '2 8s', which is valid as it keeps the same quantity but increases the digit. This is a safe play as I can verify 2 eights exist from my hand alone.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 3 0s and I have one 0 in my hand, I should consider the likelihood of there being at least three 0s in total across all players. Since each player has 8 digits, it's possible but not highly probable that there are three or more 0s. However, my hand contains a 0, which slightly increases the likelihood. Considering the next possible bids, increasing the quantity to 4 of any digit seems risky without more information. Instead, I can try to increase the digit value while keeping the quantity the same as the current bid, aiming for a digit that I have at least one of in my hand. My hand contains digits like 9, 8, 7, 5, and 4, in addition to the 0, 3, and other digits. Bidding on a digit I have, like 4, seems reasonable because if I have one, it's possible others might have more, especially since we're early in the game and haven't seen many bids. Thus, bidding 3 1s or higher, considering I have a 9 and other high digits, might not be the best strategy without knowing more about the distribution. However, since my hand has a variety of digits and given the current bid is low, a safer increase would be to the next logical digit that I can somewhat vouch for, which would be moving to a higher digit than 0 but not necessarily to the highest digits I hold. Given this, moving to '3 1s' seems like a reasonable next step as it's a small increase and 1s are relatively common in many number sequences.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have three 4s in my hand. Bidding 4 4s is a valid higher bid that increases the quantity and is well-supported by my hand, as I only need one more 4 among the other 5 players. Challenging 3 1s is too risky as it's a relatively low bid below the statistical average (4.8 expected per digit), and I have no 1s to support a challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I hold three 3s. With 40 unknown digits among the other five players, the expected number of 3s in those digits is about 4 (40 Ã— 0.1). The chance that there are at least two additional 3s to reach a total of five is therefore very high (over 90%). To top the current bid of 4 4s I can increase the quantity, so bidding 5 3s is both legal and well-supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: There are 48 digits in play and the current bid is 5 3s. In my hand, I have one 3. Statistically, across 48 digits, the expected count for any digit is about 4.8. A bid of 5 is reasonable and not outrageous, so challenging now would be risky. To make a legal higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. I have two 7s and two 8s, so bidding 5 7s leverages my hand strength and is a safe, legal move.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 7s in my hand. The current bid claims there are 5 sevens among all players. With 6 players having 8 digits each, this is possible but seems high given that I see none. Looking at the bid history, Player 0 started with '2 7s' and has now raised to '5 7s', which is a significant jump. This suggests they might be bluffing. Given I have no 7s and the aggressive bidding pattern, challenging is the safer option than making a higher bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder this round, I should make an opening bid that is credible and leverages my hand. My hand contains two 8s and two 7s, which are my strongest digits. With 40 digits in play, bidding 2 of a digit I hold twice is reasonable and not too aggressive. I'll bid 2 8s, as it's likely there are more 8s among the other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Considering the current bid is 3 0s and I have one 0 in my hand, I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Given that there are 40 total digits remaining and the bid history shows a mix of bids, challenging seems risky without more information. However, making a bid that is strictly higher than 3 0s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 9s in my hand, which is a high digit, and considering the total number of digits remaining, bidding on a higher digit seems more reasonable than challenging the current bid directly.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand is 43327464, which contains three 4s. With 40 total digits in play, the average expected count for any digit is 4. Bidding 4 4s is a valid increase over 3 9s. Since I hold three 4s, I only need one more 4 among the remaining 32 digits held by other players for the bid to be true. The probability of at least one 4 existing among 32 random digits is very high (approx 96.6%). Challenging the bid of 3 9s, while possible, carries a higher risk based on probability alone (approx 77.7% chance of 3 or more 9s in 40 digits). Making a strong, safe bid based on my hand is the best strategic move at this point.

Player 5 Reasoning: I hold three 3s and zero 4s. Challenging 4 4s only gives me about a 55-60% chance to win, which feels too risky. By bidding 5 3s I raise the quantity (making the bid legal) while leaning on my strong hand: I already have 3 of the 5 required. The other 32 unknown digits are expected to contain about 3 more 3s (mean 3.2), so the probability that at least two of them are 3s is well over 80%. This makes 5 3s a much safer position than challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 18573678, which contains one 3. The current bid is 5 3s, meaning there must be at least five 3s among the 40 digits in play. I only have one, so there must be at least four among the remaining 32 digits. The expected count of any digit in 32 random digits is about 3.2, so four or more is possible but not certain. However, the bid is not so outrageous as to make a challenge a clear favorite. To avoid risking elimination on a marginal challenge, I will make a safe, legal higher bid. I have two 8s in my hand, so I will bid 5 8s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 0 in my hand. I could bid 6 0s, increasing the quantity. Given that the total number of digits is 40, 5 8s is not an unreasonable bid, so I will bid higher rather than challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 6 0s and my hand containing one 0, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least six 0s among all active players. Since each player has 8 digits and there are 5 active players, the total number of digits is 40. The presence of one 0 in my hand contributes to the total count, but I need to assess if it's plausible for the remaining players to collectively have at least five more 0s. Considering the bidding history and the fact that no extremely high bids for 0s have been made or challenged, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of digits might not be heavily skewed towards 0s. However, without more information about the other players' hands, making a higher bid requires careful consideration. Given that my hand does not provide strong evidence for a significantly higher bid for any specific digit, and challenging the current bid could be risky if the actual count of 0s is indeed six or more, I must weigh the risks and potential rewards. Since my hand does contain a 9, which is a high digit, and considering the principle of bidding higher either in quantity or digit, I could consider bidding on a higher digit if I had enough of it to make a reasonable increase. However, my hand does not strongly support a bid for a digit higher than what has been bid, considering the quantities. Thus, I need to decide between challenging the current bid or making a strategic bid that is higher and yet plausible based on the game's progression and my hand. Given these considerations, making a bid that increases the quantity or targets a higher digit seems necessary to stay in the game, but it must be done thoughtfully to avoid overbidding or underbidding. Since I have one 9 and previous bids for 9s have been lower, I could consider increasing the bid for 9s as a strategic move, aiming to find a balance between bidding high enough to be competitive and not so high as to be implausible or easily challenged.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. There are 40 total digits across 5 players. The expected number of any specific digit is 40 / 10 = 4. A bid of 7 is significantly above this expectation. My hand contains zero 0s, making me less likely to believe the bid. The probability of having 7 or more 0s in 40 random digits with p=0.1 is approximately 3%. While previous bids on 0s (3 0s, then 6 0s) suggest someone might have some, the jump to 7 is still quite high and the overall probability remains low. Given my hand provides no support for 0s and the bid is statistically unlikely, challenging is the best strategic move.

Player 4 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round, and the current bid is 'None'. My hand is 43327464. I have three 4s, two 3s, and one each of 2, 6, and 7. There are 32 total digits among 4 players. The expected number of any specific digit is 3.2 (32 / 10). Since I have three 4s, the total expected count of 4s is approximately 3 (my hand) + 2.4 (from other players) = 5.4. Bidding 5 4s is a strong opening bid that is well-supported by my hand and the overall probability.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have zero 4s in my own 8-digit hand, meaning all five (or more) would have to be in the 24 unknown digits. With a random digit distribution, the expected number of 4s in those 24 digits is 2.4. The probability that there are at least 5 is roughly 9%. In the previous rounds, even across 48 digits there were only 5 of a given digit (7s), and across 40 digits there were just 3 zeros, suggesting no digit is concentrated enough to make 5 of one digit in 32 digits likely. Given the very low chance that five 4s actually exist, challenging is far safer than raising the bid.

By opening with 3 3s I make a bid that I know is guaranteed true (since I alone satisfy it), yet itâ€™s not so high that it invites an immediate challengeâ€”opponents will see it as merely slightly above the statistical expectation of about 2â€“3 per digit in 24 numbers.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 18573678, which contains one 3. The current bid is 3 3s. With 24 digits in play, it's plausible that there are at least 3 threes among all hands, since I only know of 1 in my hand and there are 16 unknown digits between the other two players. Challenging now is risky, as it's not unlikely that at least two more 3s exist. To make a higher bid, I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding 3 8s is reasonable and keeps pressure on the others.
