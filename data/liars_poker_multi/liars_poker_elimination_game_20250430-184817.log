Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s by Player 0, which is a very low bid and likely true since it only requires one 0 across all hands. I have two 4s in my hand, so I can confidently bid higher. Bidding 2 4s is a reasonable increase, as it raises both the quantity and the digit, and I have support for 4s in my hand. This keeps the game moving and avoids an immediate challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding 2 5s is a guaranteed minimal raise above 2 4s and is very likely given the expected distribution of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s made by Player 2. Given that I only have one 5 and there are 48 total digits, it's possible but not extremely likely that there's at least one more 5 among the other players. Since my hand doesn't provide strong evidence for a higher bid, especially considering the digit 5 itself, and the fact that bidding higher without strong evidence could lead to an unlikely bid, I should challenge this bid as it seems uncertain and I don't have enough information to confidently make a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the round and with 40 digits total, the expected number of any given digit is around four. I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding three 5s is a plausible opening bid that’s unlikely to be challenged.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. With 32 total digits and an expected 3.2 of each digit, I only need one more 5 among the 24 unknown cards. The chance of at least one more is over 90%, making 3 5s a safe opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. There are 32 total digits among 4 players. The expected number of any digit is 3.2, making 3 5s statistically plausible. Player 2, who made the bid, has won challenges on 5s in the previous two rounds, suggesting they might hold 5s or are confident. Challenging seems risky as I have zero 5s, meaning the other 24 digits need to contain fewer than three 5s. I have two 2s in my hand (09227816). Bidding 4 2s is a safe and logical next step. It's higher than 3 5s (quantity increase) and is well-supported by my hand, as needing only two more 2s among the other 24 digits is highly probable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 44089698, which contains two 4s, one 0, one 6, one 8, and one 9. The current bid is 4 3s by Player 0. I have no 3s in my hand, so I must rely on the likelihood of 3s in other players' hands. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 4 3s means roughly 1 in 8 digits should be a 3, which is plausible given a uniform distribution. However, I could make a higher bid to test the waters. Bidding 4 4s is a higher bid since the digit increases, and I have two 4s myself, making it somewhat likely that there are at least two more 4s among the other 24 digits. Alternatively, I could challenge, but since 4 3s isn't an outrageous bid, challenging carries a higher risk of losing. I’ll bid 4 4s to stay in the game and push the bidding higher.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 4s in my hand, so all four 4s must be among the 24 other cards. The probability of at least four 4s in those 24 cards is only about 23%, making Player 1’s bid unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand and there are 16 unknown cards remaining. The expected number of 5s among those is about 1.6, so bidding 3 fives has roughly an 82% chance of being truthful. It’s a reasonable, safe opening bid to set the baseline.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:1 - google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 2. I have zero 5s in my hand (09227816). For the bid to be true, the other two players (Player 0 and Player 2) must have at least three 5s combined in their 16 digits. The expected number of 5s across all 24 digits is 2.4 (24/10). The bid of 3 is slightly above average. Since I hold zero 5s, the probability that the total count is less than 3 (meaning 0, 1, or 2 fives held by the other two players) seems reasonably high compared to the probability of them holding 3 or more. Player 2 has successfully bid 5s in previous rounds, but the number of players and digits has decreased, making the bid riskier. While I could bid 4 2s (having two 2s), challenging seems statistically slightly more favorable given I possess none of the bid digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. With 16 total digits, my opponent needs at least one 5 among their 8 to make three in total. The probability of them having at least one 5 is about 57%, so they’re unlikely to challenge. Starting with 3 5s also uses a higher digit to limit their digit-only raising options.
