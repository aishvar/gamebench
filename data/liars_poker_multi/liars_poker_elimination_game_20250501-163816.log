Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player, I should start with a bid that is likely to be successful, as there are many possibilities for the other players' hands. I have two 6s in my hand, so I'll bid 3 6s, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which means there need to be at least two more 6s among the other 40 digits. This is plausible, so challenging now would be risky. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 3 9s leverages my strong position in 9s and is a safe, legal next bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding 4 9s would be a pure bluff, and I don't have enough information to confidently make that call. I can bid a higher quantity with a different digit, or a higher digit with the same quantity. I have two 8s, so bidding 4 8s is a reasonable option, increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 3 0s. Since 9s are less common than 8s or 0s, and I have 8s, I will bid 4 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand contains no 8s, but the expected total number of 8s across all 48 digits is 4.8, making the bid plausible. Bidding 5 8s increases the quantity while maintaining the digit, leveraging the likelihood that other players hold additional 8s. Challenging would risk elimination if the bid is valid, so a cautious bid is preferable.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s made by Player 3. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that there are 6 active players and each has 8 secret digits, there are a total of 48 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. Bidding 6 8s seems too high and unlikely. However, bidding a slightly higher quantity or digit is an option. I can see that bidding 6 0s is a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s made by Player 4. My hand contains no 0s, and with five other players, it's unlikely that there are six 0s in total. Challenging this bid is a reasonable move.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid that reflects my hand. Bidding 2 9s is a reasonable starting point, as it's based on the actual count in my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Raising the quantity to 3 seems reasonable, considering the current bid is relatively low.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand (digits: 9, 9, 9, 6, 9, 1, 8, 7, 5). The current bid is 3 9s, which I am already meeting alone. With 5 players and 40 digits in play, it is very likely there are more 9s among the remaining 32 digits. Therefore, challenging is unwise. The next valid bid must be either 3 9s -> 3 9s (not allowed), 3 9s -> 4 0s (increase quantity), or 3 9s -> 3 9s+1 (not possible since 9 is the highest digit). I will bid 4 9s, as it is the most logical incremental bid and is supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Given the previous elimination due to an overbid on 0s and the fact that there are only 40 total digits remaining across 5 players, it's unlikely there are 4 9s. While bidding higher is possible, challenging seems more strategically sound. The previous bids on 9s from Players 5 and 0 also suggest a possible bluff.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I am the first to bid this round. My hand contains three 9s, one 8, one 7, one 6, one 5, and one 1. Since I have three 9s, bidding 3 9s is a strong opening that leverages my hand and puts pressure on the next player to either raise the quantity or bid a higher digit. This is a standard and safe opening bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s. Bidding 4 4s increases the quantity from 3 to 4, which is a valid higher bid. Given my two 4s and assuming at least two more in other players' hands, this bid is plausible and strategically raises the stakes without relying on uncertain digits like 9s.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s, and the current bid is 4 4s. Bidding 4 9s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 9s and targets a higher digit than the current bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 5, but I have two 9s in my hand. I will make a higher bid to increase quantity and digit, as my hand is strong for this digit.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:3 - gpt-4.1-2025-04-14) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand (9, 9, 9, 6, 9, 1, 8, 7, 5). The current bid is 5 9s. There are 32 digits in play, and I know I have 3 of the 9s. That leaves 29 digits among the other 3 players. For the bid to be valid, there must be at least 2 more 9s among those 24 digits. The probability of this is not extremely low but not guaranteed either. Given the recent history where 4 9s was bid and was actually met (with 5 total), it is plausible that there are at least 5 9s again. However, with me holding 3 already, the likelihood that there are 6 or more 9s is significantly lower. I do not have enough information to confidently challenge 5 9s, so I will make a minimal higher bid to stay in the game and put pressure on the next player.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand (9, 9, 9, 6, 1, 8, 7, 5). The current bid is 5 9s, which means there must be at least two more 9s among the remaining 24 digits held by the other three players. Given that in the previous round, a bid of 4 9s was challenged and the actual count was 5, it's possible that at least some of those 9s are still in play. However, the probability that there are at least two more 9s among 24 digits is not unreasonable, but it's getting risky. Still, since the previous 5 9s was just barely met, and I hold three of them, it's unlikely there are significantly more. I will challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. My hand contains one 4, but with 24 total digits remaining across three players, it's uncertain if there are at least four 4s. Challenging this bid could expose a potential bluff, especially since the previous challenge by Player 5 succeeded. If the actual count is below 4, I win; otherwise, Player 3 wins.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid that reflects my actual hand is logical. Bidding 2 9s is a safe and accurate move, as I have exactly two 9s. This sets a baseline for the opponent to challenge or respond to.
