Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make a reasonable initial bid based on my hand. My hand contains three 3s. Bidding 4 3s is logical because I have three, and it's plausible that at least one other player has a 3, making the total count valid. This bid is conservative yet leverages my hand's strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 4 3s. Bidding 4 4s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). With the average number of any digit being 4.8 across all players, it's likely that there are at least four 4s in total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 1's bid of 4 4s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (97474509), I have two 4s. With 6 players each having 8 digits, there are 48 total digits in play. For Player 1's bid to be valid, there need to be at least 4 fours in total. Since I already have 2 fours in my hand, there only need to be 2 more fours among the other 40 digits held by other players. This is quite reasonable and likely to be true. Therefore, challenging would be risky. I should make a higher bid. I could bid 5 4s, but I only have 2 fours myself, so I'd be counting on 3 more among other players. Instead, I'll bid 4 5s, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit. I don't have any 5s in my hand, but with 40 digits among other players, it's reasonable that there could be at least 4 fives total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand, which makes the bid somewhat plausible, so challenging it is risky. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 0s. Bidding 5 0s is a valid higher bid (quantity 5 is greater than 4) and is well-supported by my hand, requiring only 3 more 0s from the other 5 players (40 digits), which is close to the average expectation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have zero 0s in my hand. Bidding higher than 5 0s is necessary. I have four 8s. Bidding 6 8s is a reasonable option, as it significantly increases the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 5 1s, 5 2s, etc., but given my hand, 6 8s seems more strategically sound. It is unlikely anyone else has enough 8s to reach 6, and it's a digit I can contribute significantly to.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I have no 9s in my hand, and the expected number of 9s across all players is 4.8. Bidding higher (e.g., 7 9s) is risky without evidence, while challenging a 6 9s bid with no 9s in my hand suggests low probability of success for the bidder. Challenging is the optimal move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains three 3s and two 0s. Bidding 4 3s leverages my existing 3s and is a conservative estimate considering four other players. This bid is low enough to be plausible but allows room for escalation. Bidding on 0s (3 0s) is also possible, but 4 3s better utilizes my higher concentration of 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '3' in my hand (69222340), which means there need to be at least three more '3s in other players' hands to meet the bid of 4 3s. Given the average expected count for any digit is 4 across 40 total digits, this bid aligns closely with statistical expectations. Challenging carries high risk here since the bid is plausible. Instead, raising to 4 4s (I have one '4') continues the bidding hierarchy logically while leveraging my hand's composition.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The current bid is '4 4s' made by Player 1. Looking at my hand (97474509), I have two 4s. Since there are 5 active players with 8 digits each (40 total digits), and I already have 2 of the 4s, it's reasonable that there could be at least 2 more 4s among the other 32 digits held by other players. So the current bid of '4 4s' seems plausible. I could challenge, but it's risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 5, one 7, two 9s, one 0, and one 4. I could bid '4 5s' (same quantity, higher digit) since I have one 5 already, but I already made that bid in the previous round. I could bid '4 7s' since I have one 7, or '4 9s' since I have two 9s. The '4 9s' bid is stronger since I already have two 9s in my hand. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to '5 4s', but that's riskier since I only have two 4s myself. I'll go with '4 9s' as it's a safer bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. With 40 total digits among 5 players, the average expected count for any digit is 4. While I have zero 9s, challenging a bid of 4 is statistically risky as it's the average count. I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 5 0s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and is a reasonable incremental step based on my hand strength for 0s. This requires only 3 more 0s from the remaining 32 digits among other players, which is plausible. Bidding feels safer than challenging a statistically average bid at this stage.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have zero 0s in my hand. Player 2 bid 4 9s, which is a relatively high bid given the limited number of total digits. Bidding 6 0s would be a bluff, but plausible. Bidding 5 1s is also plausible, and slightly increases the digit. Given the previous rounds, players are willing to bid high, and I have no 0s, I will attempt to increase the bid with a digit I have. I have four 8s, so bidding 6 8s is a reasonable option. However, I already bid 6 8s in the previous round and was challenged. Therefore, I will bid 5 1s to change the digit and quantity slightly.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. The expected number of 1s across 40 digits is 4, making the bid of 5 slightly above average. Given the previous elimination via a challenged 6 9s bid, which was proven false, this suggests players may overbid. Challenging 5 1s carries risk but aligns with statistical likelihood and historical patterns of bluffing.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player to bid in this round, I need to start with a valid bid. My hand contains three 3s, so bidding 4 3s is a reasonable opening. This bid is conservative based on my holdings and follows the pattern of previous rounds where 4 [digit]s was a common starting bid. Since I have three 3s, requiring one more 3 from the remaining players seems plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. With 32 total digits remaining and an expected average of ~3.4 3s across all hands (including my one 3), the bid of 4 3s is slightly above the statistical average. Since Player 0 initiated this bid and the game history shows aggressive bidding patterns, there's a reasonable chance this bid is a bluff. Challenging leverages the statistical unlikelihood of reaching 4 3s, especially with limited digits remaining.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 4 3s is reasonable, as it slightly exceeds my own count and accounts for potential 3s in the other two players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (97474509), I have zero 3s. Player 0 has bid 4 3s, meaning they're claiming there are at least 4 3s among all players. Since I have none, all 4 would need to be between Player 0 and Player 3 (each with 8 digits). This is possible but not guaranteed. Player 0 has made this same bid (4 3s) in previous rounds, which might indicate they have some 3s in their hand. I could challenge, but it's risky since the bid is relatively low and reasonable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 4s in my hand, so bidding on 4s would be safer. I also have two 7s, one 9, one 5, one 0. I'll bid 4 4s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s made by Player 2. My hand contains zero 4s. With 3 players remaining and 8 digits each, there are 24 total digits. The average expected count for any digit is 2.4. The current bid of 4 4s is significantly above this average. Since I hold no 4s, the other 16 digits held by the remaining two players must contain at least four 4s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 4s among the other 16 digits is only 1.6. A count of 4 or more from an expected value of 1.6 is statistically unlikely. Based on the low probability of the bid being true given my hand, challenging is the optimal move.

Player 3 Reasoning: It is the start of a new round, and I am the first player to bid. With 16 total digits across two players, a bid of 3 is a common and reasonable starting point. My hand contains two 0s, making a bid of '3 0s' a safe and plausible opening bid based on my own hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have two 0s in my hand, so the total number of 0s depends on Player 3's hand. If Player 3 has no 0s, the total is 2, making the bid false. The probability Player 3 has at least one 0 is ~57% (1 - (9/10)^8), but this is uncertain. Challenging the bid gives me a ~43% chance to win if they have no 0s. Bidding higher (e.g., 4 0s) would require Player 3 to have two 0s, which is less likely. Challenging is the optimal move here.
