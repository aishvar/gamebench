Player 0 Reasoning: I'm the first player to bid in this round. Let me analyze my hand '19798996'. I have: one 1, two 9s, one 7, one 8, and three 9s. Since I have three 9s in my hand, I know there are at least 3 nines among all players. This is a good starting point for my bid. I could bid '3 9s', but since 9 is the highest digit, I might want to start with a slightly lower quantity to leave room for escalation. However, since I actually have three 9s myself, bidding '3 9s' is very safe and puts pressure on other players to either increase the quantity or challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 44508626, I have zero 9s. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total), and Player 0 claiming there are at least 3 nines, this seems plausible as other players could have 9s. Given my hand has two 6s, I can make a safe bid of '3 6s' which is valid (same quantity but lower digit than 9s). This is a conservative play since I know there are at least 2 sixes just in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. For there to be 3 9s, other players would need to have all of them. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely given I have none. However, since this is a relatively low bid at the start of the game, I'll make a higher bid instead of challenging. I have two 4s in my hand, so bidding 4 4s is a reasonable increase that I'm confident about.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have 2 4s in my hand, which is the digit of the current bid. I can increase the quantity or keep it the same but bid a higher digit. Since 4 4s is a relatively low bid, I'll increase the quantity to 5 and keep the digit the same, as I have two 4s in my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 5 4s, which I have none of. Bidding 5 5s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, leveraging my two 5s. Challenging risks elimination if the bid is valid, but 5 4s is plausible given 48 total digits. A safer move is to raise the bid with a higher digit I actually hold.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have the digits 0,3,6,2,7,4,0,4 in my hand. Counting the 5s in my hand: none. Given the previous bids, the total number of 4s was 4, and the bid was raised to 5 5s, which seems unlikely because I have no 5s and the total number of 5s across all hands is probably low. Challenging now could be advantageous since the previous bid appears exaggerated. Bidding higher on 5s or 6s seems risky without supporting evidence, so challenging seems the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The previous bid was 5 5s, which was challenged and found to be incorrect since the actual count was 4. Now, it's my turn to bid. I have the digits 0, 3, 6, 2, 7, 4, 0, 4. Counting my own digits, I have one 3, one 6, one 2, one 7, and two 4s. The highest count I can confidently claim for any digit is 2 (for 4s). To be safe, I should bid slightly higher than the previous bid of 5 5s. Since I can't confidently bid more than 4 4s, I will increase the quantity to 6 for a digit I have in my hand, such as 4s, to make a reasonable bid that challenges the previous bid's likelihood. Bidding 6 4s would be a strategic move, as I only have 2 4s, so I should bid a number I can support. But since I have only 2 4s, I can't bid 6 4s. The next best is to bid 6 of a digit I have at least two of, but I only have two 4s. Alternatively, I can bid 4 4s, which is higher than 3 4s, but the previous bid was 5 4s, so I need to go higher. Since I can't confidently bid more than 4 4s, I should bid 4 4s, but that would be lower than 5 4s, which is invalid. The previous bid was 5 4s, so I need to bid at least 6 4s to be higher, but I only have 2 4s. Therefore, I should challenge the previous bid, as it's unlikely that there are 5 4s in total, given my hand and the previous challenge outcome.

Player 4 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made in this round yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have the digits 0, 3, 6, 2, 7, 4, 0, 4. Counting my digits: 0 appears twice, 4 appears twice, and the others once. To be safe, I should bid a quantity that I believe is plausible given my hand. I have at least two 0s and two 4s, so a bid of 2 0s or 2 4s is reasonable. To increase the bid, I will choose to bid 3 4s, as I have two 4s, but I can also consider that other players might have more. Since it's the first bid, I will bid 3 4s, which is a plausible starting bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits and an expected ~3.2 additional 4s, bidding 4 4s is a minimal raise and has a high probability of being true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have the hand 19798996, which contains zero 4s. The current bid is '4 4s' made by Player 5. With 5 active players having 8 digits each (40 total digits), and knowing I have zero 4s, there are at most 32 digits among the other players that could be 4s. Player 4 previously bid '3 4s', suggesting they might have at least one 4. Player 5 increased to '4 4s', which is still a reasonable bid. Since I don't have any 4s, I should either make a higher bid or challenge. Looking at my hand, I have three 9s, which gives me confidence to bid '4 9s' - same quantity but higher digit. This is a safe move that leverages my strong holding in 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 44508626, I have zero 9s. The current bid claims there are 4 nines across all hands (40 total digits). Given that I see no 9s in my hand (which represents 20% of all digits in play), and 9s are generally less common in random distributions, 4 9s seems unlikely. Additionally, Player 0's sudden jump to 9s after others were bidding on 4s might indicate a bluff. The probability of having 4 9s in the remaining 32 digits (40 - my 8) is relatively low.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (19798996), I have three 9s. Since there are 4 active players with 8 digits each (32 total digits), and I'm starting the bidding, I should make a conservative but strategic bid. Given my three 9s, there's a good chance there are more 9s among the other players. Based on the previous rounds, I've successfully defended a bid of 4 9s before, so I know there were at least 5 9s in the previous round (with 5 players). Even with one player eliminated, I still have 3 of those 9s, so bidding 4 9s again seems reasonable and safe.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s, and I have the digits 0, 3, 6, 2, 7, 4, 0, 4 in my hand. Counting the 9s I have is zero. Since the total number of 9s across all players must be at least 5 for the bid to hold, and I have no 9s, challenging seems the best move. The previous bid of 5 9s is unlikely to be correct, given my hand and the previous bids, so challenging is justified.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. To outbid 2 9s, I must increase the quantity to at least 3 of some digit. With two 0s and an over 80% chance of at least one more 0 among the remaining 16 cards (1–(0.9^16)≈0.815), bidding 3 0s is very likely to hold.

Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (19798996), I don't have any 0s. The current bid is 3 0s, which means Player 5 believes there are at least 3 zeros across all players' hands. Since I have no 0s, all 3+ would need to come from Player 2 and Player 5's hands combined. This is possible but not guaranteed. I could challenge, but it's risky since 3 zeros out of 16 digits (Player 2 and 5's hands) is quite reasonable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have three 9s in my hand, so I'm confident in bidding 3 1s (same quantity, higher digit) or 4 9s (higher quantity, lower digit). I'll go with 3 1s since it's a smaller increase from the current bid, giving me more flexibility later.

Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (19798996), I have zero 4s. Player 5 has bid 3 4s, meaning they believe there are at least 3 fours between our combined hands. Since I have none, all 3 would need to be in their hand. With 8 digits per player, it's certainly possible they have 3 or more 4s. I could make a higher bid, but I should be cautious. Looking at my hand, I have three 9s, which gives me confidence to bid on 9s. I could bid '3 5s' (higher digit than 4s), but I don't have any 5s. I could bid '3 6s' (I have one 6), '3 7s' (I have none), '3 8s' (I have none), or '3 9s' (I have three). The safest option based on my hand is to bid '3 9s', which keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit value.
