Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s made by Player 0. I have one 0 in my hand, which supports the possibility of at least one 0 existing across all hands. Since the bid is very low, it's likely to be true or easily exceeded. I will make a higher bid to keep the game moving. Given my hand has two 9s, bidding 2 9s feels like a safe and reasonable increase in both quantity and digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s would be a lie, but potentially effective. However, given I have no 9s, and 2 9s is already on the table, another player could also have 9s. I have two 6s and two 7s. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable increase in quantity and is based on my hand. Bidding 2 7s is also possible, but 3 6s feels slightly better as it is a larger increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I see only one 6 in my hand. Across 48 digits the expected count of any digit is 4.8, so bidding 4 sixes is plausible. Raising the quantity from 3 to 4 keeps the bid valid and applies pressure on the next player.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s, made by Player 3. I have a 6 in my hand. I can increase the digit but need to maintain the same quantity. Bidding 4 7s seems like a reasonable strategy.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. My hand is 30272240, which contains zero 7s. The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 4. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For the bid of 4 7s to be true, those 4 sevens must be distributed among the other 5 players' hands. This is certainly possible. I have one 8 in my hand, so I could bid 4 8s, which would be higher than 4 7s. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to 5 and choose any digit. Since I have two 2s in my hand, bidding 5 2s might be reasonable. I also have two 0s, but I'll go with 5 2s as my bid since I have direct evidence of two of them in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 05373997, which contains two 3s. The current bid is 5 3s by Player 0. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an average of 4.8 of each digit is expected across all hands. Since I have 2 of the 3s, it means there are only 3 more 3s needed among the other 40 digits to meet the bid of 5. This seems plausible given the average expectation. I am considering raising the bid to 6 3s, as it’s a small increase and still within a reasonable range based on the statistical expectation. Alternatively, I could switch to a higher digit, but since I have support for 3s in my hand, I’ll stick with them for now. Challenging seems risky since 5 3s is not an outrageous bid with 48 digits in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. Bidding 7 3s is possible, but risky. Bidding a higher digit with a lower quantity seems safer. I have two 6s, so I can bid 4 6s, which is a valid bid and matches the previous high bid of 4 6s. However, Player 3 already bid 4 6s. I also have two 7s. Bidding 5 7s is a reasonable option. Since the current bid is 6 3s, I can bid 6 4s, which is a valid higher bid. I have no 4s. I can bid 6 5s, but I have only one 5. I can bid 6 6s, but I have only two 6s. I can bid 6 7s. I have two 7s. This is risky. I can bid 6 8s, but I have no 8s. I can bid 6 9s, but I have no 9s. I can bid 7 0s, 7 1s, 7 2s, 7 5s, 7 6s, 7 7s, 7 9s. I have one 5, two 6s, two 7s, one 9. I think bidding 7 7s is too risky. Bidding 7 5s is also risky. I think challenging is a good option, as 6 3s seems like a high number to reach with 48 total digits remaining.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet in this round and I am starting the bidding, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand is 05373997, which gives me two 9s, two 7s, and one each of 0, 3, and 5. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, a safe starting bid would be something I have at least some of in my hand. I’ll bid 3 9s, as I have two myself, and it’s plausible that at least one more 9 exists among the other 32 digits. This keeps the bid low to avoid early challenges while still being strategic.

Player 3 Reasoning: I hold three 4s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits, the chance of at least one more 4 among them is about 96.6%, making 4 total 4s very likely. Bidding 4 4s is a valid raise over 3 9s and is statistically strong.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 4's bid of 5 4s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (30272240), I have only one 4. For there to be at least 5 4s total, the other 4 players would need to have at least 4 more 4s among them, which is an average of 1 per player. This seems quite reasonable and not worth challenging. For my bid, I could bid 6 4s, but that's risky given I only have one 4. I could bid 5 5s, but I don't have any 5s in my hand. I do have two 2s and two 7s, so I could confidently bid 5 7s (same quantity, higher digit). This is a safer move than increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s by Player 0, which is a very low bid and likely true since it only requires one 0 across all hands. I have one 0 in my hand (05373997), so it's already partially supported. With 32 total digits across 4 players, it's almost certain that at least one 0 exists. Challenging this bid is risky and likely to result in a loss. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s and two 7s, which are strong digits to bid on. I’ll bid 2 9s, as it’s a modest increase from 1 0s, leverages my hand, and keeps the bid conservative early in the round.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have 0s and 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s, which seems relatively low. I should increase the quantity to 4 and the digit to 9, as I have a good chance of having more 9s than 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s by Player 0, which is a very low and conservative bid. In my hand (05373997), I have two 9s, two 7s, and one each of 0, 3, 5. Since the bid is low, I can safely increase it. With a total of 24 digits across three players, bidding 2 9s seems reasonable as I already have two 9s myself, making it likely that there could be at least one more among the other 16 digits. This bid increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 1 0s, adhering to the rules of a higher bid. I see no reason to challenge such a low bid as it is highly plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 05373997, which contains no 4s. The current bid by Player 3 is 4 4s, meaning there should be at least 4 fours across both our hands (16 digits total). Since I have zero 4s, all 4 would need to be in Player 3's hand of 8 digits. While it's possible, it's not highly likely, as it would mean half of their digits are 4s. However, challenging is risky because if they do have 4 or more 4s, I lose. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s and two 7s, which are strong digits. Bidding higher, such as 5 4s or moving to a higher digit like 4 5s, seems safer. Given the bidding history, Player 3 has bid on 4s multiple times, which might indicate they have some 4s, so I’ll avoid challenging for now and make a higher bid. I’ll bid 4 5s to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, as it's a conservative increase and I have no information on 5s beyond my own hand (one 5).
