Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6, one 5, one 2, one 0, one 3, one 4, one 1, and one 2 in my hand. Since the current bid is None and I'm starting the bidding, I should make a conservative bid based on my hand. A reasonable starting bid would be to claim a small quantity of a digit I have, such as two 2s, as I have one 2 and it's possible others have at least one more.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have one 6 in my hand. Given the total digits remaining and the fact that there are 6 players, it's not unreasonable to assume there could be more 6s in other players' hands. Bidding 3 6s increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a valid and strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand of 18318771, I have no 6s. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total), and Player 1 claiming there are at least 3 6s, this is possible but not certain. However, since I have no 6s, that means all 3 claimed 6s would need to be in the other 5 players' hands (40 digits). While possible, I can safely bid '3 7s' since I have two 7s in my hand, making it a more confident bid while following the rules of increasing the digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 3 8s increases the digit while keeping the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, which means there are at least 47 other digits across all players that could potentially be 8s. The current bid is 3 8s, which means Player 3 is claiming there are at least 3 8s total among all players. Since I already have one 8, we only need 2 more 8s among the other 5 players (with 40 digits total) for this bid to be valid. This seems quite reasonable. I could either make a higher bid or accept this one. Looking at my hand, I have one 9, so I could bid '3 9s' (same quantity, higher digit). Alternatively, I could bid '4 1s' since I have two 1s in my hand, or '4 4s' since I have one 4. I think bidding '3 9s' is the safest option since it's the smallest increment above the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have the hand 66073841, which contains one 8 and no 9s. The bidding has been incrementing the digit, and the quantity has been stuck at 3. Given that there are 48 total digits and the bid is for 3 9s, it's plausible that there are at least three 9s in the game. However, I can make a higher bid by either increasing the quantity or bidding the same quantity on a higher digit. Since I don't have any 9s, and it's unlikely there are exactly three 9s given the distribution, I'll increase the quantity to make a more believable bid. I'll bid 4 9s, as it's a conservative increase and keeps the digit the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, and I have no 9s in my hand. With 5 other players, it's possible that there are 4 9s in total, but it's a risky bid. Since I don't have any 9s, I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding higher would require going to 5 of any digit or 4 of a higher digit (but 9 is the highest). Since 5 of any digit seems too high given the current bidding, I'll challenge the 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The game just started with a new round, and there are no bids yet. Starting with a conservative bid based on my hand seems reasonable. Bidding 2 6s is a safe initial move, as it's likely there are at least two 6s among all players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: You have one 6 in your hand. The current bid is 2 6s. Since there are 40 digits remaining and 5 players (including you), it's likely that there are at least 3 6s in total. Bidding 3 6s is a safe move to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Challenging seems risky since it's plausible that there are at least 2 6s.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:2 - claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (18318771). Player 1 claims there are at least 3 sixes total. Given that I only have one 6, and the previous player raised from 2 to 3 sixes, it's likely they have at least one 6. Even if they have two 6s plus my one, that only accounts for 3 total, leaving no room for error. With 5 players still active, 3 6s is a reasonable bid, but going higher would be risky. Since I can't make the same bid, I could bid 3 7s (which I have two of in my hand), but I think challenging here is the safer play since we're early in the round and the bid is already pushing the likely limit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The last round ended with a successful challenge, reducing the number of active players to 4 and the total digits to 32. With no bids yet in this round, I need to make a valid higher bid than the last round's highest bid, which was 3 9s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 4 0s is a reasonable starting bid, as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the previous highest bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. My hand contains one 0, and with three other players, it's unlikely there are 4 zeros in total. Challenging this bid is a reasonable risk given the low probability of the bid being true.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid of 3 8s, which is a higher quantity than my own count, and I'm hoping that the total count of 8s across all players meets or exceeds this bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 3/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher than '3 8s' or challenge. Looking at my hand (25496814), I have one 8. So out of the 24 total digits in the game, I know about 1 of the 8s. For the bid '3 8s' to be valid, there need to be at least 2 more 8s between the other two players (who have 16 digits total). This is certainly possible. Since I have one 8 myself, the bid seems reasonable. I could bid '4 0s', but I don't have any 0s in my hand, making it risky. I could bid '3 9s', which is safer since I have one 9 in my hand. I'll go with '3 9s' as it's the minimal valid increase over the current bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand (65203412). The current bid is 3 9s, which seems high given that in the previous round, a bid of 4 9s was challenged and only 2 9s were found. With only 24 digits remaining and no 9s in my hand, it's unlikely there are 3 9s across all players. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6, one 5, one 2, one 0, one 3, one 4, one 1, and one 2 in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have one 6, so bidding 2 6s is a reasonable starting point, considering the total digits remaining and the possibility that Player 3 might have at least one more 6.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains two 8s. The current bid is 2 6s. Bidding 2 8s is a valid move since it maintains the same quantity but increases the digit, leveraging my known 8s to make a credible bid. This avoids risking a challenge with uncertain outcomes.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, which means Player 3 is suggesting there is at least one more 8 in their hand. Given that the total digits remaining are 16 and the game has been aggressive with challenges, it's plausible that Player 3 has at least one 8. To keep the game going, I can bid higher by increasing the digit to 9, which is a safe move since I don't have any 9s in my hand but it's a higher digit than 8.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. My hand contains no 9s, and with only 16 digits total, it's unlikely there are two 9s between both players. Previous challenges have succeeded when bids were improbable, so challenging this bid is a strategic move.
