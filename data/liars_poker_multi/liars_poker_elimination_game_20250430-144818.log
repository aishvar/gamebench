Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the bidding and there are no previous bids to consider, I should make a bid based on my hand. I have the digits 5, 3, 9, 0, 1, 6, 0, and 9. Since I have two 0s and two 9s, but considering the need to make a bid that is reasonable yet not too high for the first bid, I will choose a digit I have only one of but is on the higher end, like 9, to make a bid of 1 9s. This is a conservative start, acknowledging the total number of digits in play is 48, and it allows for the game to progress while minimizing initial risk.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand. With 5 other players, it's possible that at least one other player has a 9, making the current bid of 1 9s plausible. However, since I have a strong hand with multiple 2s and 4s, I can make a higher bid based on my own hand to increase the pressure.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I don't have any 2s in my hand. While I don't have strong information to challenge, I also don't want to bid without a good reason. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity to 5 and choosing a digit like 0. This is a relatively safe bid as it doesn't rely on me having many of that digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. My hand contains one 0, making the bid plausible but not certain. Challenging a bid that is close to the expected value (5 total 0s) is risky. My hand is strong in 9s (three) and 5s (two). Bidding on my strongest digit, 9, allows me to make a credible higher bid. Bidding 6 9s increases the quantity from the previous bid (5) and is well supported by my hand (I have 3, needing 3 more from the other 5 players, which is close to the expected count of 4). This seems like a solid and safe bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s, and I have one 9 in my hand. To make a valid bid, I should increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have no 9s other than the one I already bid, I'll increase the digit to 9s and bid 7 9s, which is a reasonable value considering the remaining digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4.8. A bid of 7 9s is already above average. Since I have none, it's more likely that other players don't have many either. While not impossible, 7 9s seems like a high bid given my hand and the average distribution. Challenging seems like a reasonable play.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have 2 9s in my hand. The current bid is None. I should start by bidding a reasonable quantity and digit. I have two 9s, and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. I can start with a bid of 2 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 2 9s and my hand containing one 9, I must assess the likelihood of there being at least two 9s among all active players. Considering there are 40 digits in total and each player has 8 digits, the distribution of 9s could vary widely. However, since I have one 9, it's possible that other players could also have 9s, making the bid plausible. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since my hand doesn't provide strong evidence for a higher quantity of 9s or the presence of higher digits in large quantities, I must consider challenging the bid if it seems unlikely or making a cautious increase. Given that the previous round had a bid of 7 9s which was successful, it indicates a significant presence of 9s. Thus, bidding higher on 9s might be risky without more information. However, the bid of 2 9s is relatively low, suggesting that Player 4 might be trying to play it safe or doesn't have strong information about the distribution of 9s. I have one 9, and considering the total number of digits, it's reasonable to assume there could be at least one more 9 among the other players, supporting the current bid. Given this, a safe strategy would be to slightly increase the bid, taking into account the information from my hand and the game history. Since my hand contains a 6 and no other digit that appears in a quantity higher than one, and considering the need to make a strictly higher bid, I could consider bidding on a digit that I have, but given the low quantity of any single digit I hold besides the 9, and the fact that I only have one 9, making a bid on a higher digit or slightly increasing the quantity on 9s seems more reasonable. However, without strong evidence for a large number of any digit, the best course of action seems to be to challenge the current bid, as it allows me to test the validity of Player 4's bid without committing to a potentially risky higher bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s, which is relatively low, but given that the previous challenges to bids involving 9s have failed (actual counts were higher than bids), it's possible there are more 9s in other players' hands. However, with only 32 digits remaining and 4 players, the probability of having at least 2 more 9s is uncertain. Since I don't have any 9s, I'll challenge the bid to see if the total count is indeed at least 2.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Given that there are only 24 total digits, bidding 4 9s seems like a reasonable and safe increase. It's also possible that the other players have few or no 9s, making the bid less risky.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains three 9s. The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 2. There are 24 total digits across 3 players. For the bid of 4 9s to be true, the other two players (Player 2 and Player 4) must have a combined total of at least one 9 among their 16 digits. Given the history of 9s appearing in higher counts in previous rounds among the surviving players (actual counts of 7, 7, and 5 when totals were 48, 40, and 32 respectively), it is highly probable that at least one of them holds a 9. Challenging the bid of 4 9s is therefore very risky, as I would only win if they have zero 9s between them. Instead, I should make a higher bid. The most plausible bid based on my hand is 5 9s, which requires the other two players to have a combined total of at least two 9s. This is a reasonable possibility given the historical frequency of 9s among these players.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s made by Player 3, which is a high quantity but not the highest possible. I have two 9s in my hand, which is a good starting point. Given the remaining digits, I should increase the quantity to 6 to make a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s by Player 2. My hand contains three 9s. The game history shows previous challenges on 9s resulting in actual counts of 7, 7, and 5, indicating that 9s are likely more prevalent than average in this game. The current round's bidding has also focused solely on 9s (3->4->5->6->7). While 7 9s is a high bid relative to the average expectation for 24 digits, the historical data and the aggressive bidding sequence suggest that the actual count of 9s is likely high, potentially 7 or more. Challenging 7 9s is very risky if the actual count is 7 or higher, which is plausible. Bidding higher is necessary. Given the focus on 9s and my strong hand in 9s (3 is above average), bidding 8 9s is the most direct and strategic escalation, signaling confidence in the high count of 9s and continuing the pressure on the other players within the established bidding pattern. Bidding 7 of another digit is less aligned with the current game flow and potentially riskier given my hand composition for other digits.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 9s made by Player 3. With 24 total digits remaining, bidding 9 9s doesn't seem possible. However, I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 10 8s is not possible, but bidding 10 9s would be, which is higher than 8 9s. Since I have two 9s, bidding 10 9s is a reasonable increase in quantity.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand (09595149). The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 2. Since I alone have three 9s, the total count of 9s across both players is guaranteed to be at least 3. This means the current bid is true, and I cannot challenge. I must make a higher bid. The most straightforward higher bid is 4 9s. With my three 9s, this bid is true if Player 2 has at least one 9 in their 8 digits. The probability of Player 2 having at least one 9 is high (approximately 57%). This is the safest bid that increases the quantity, leveraging my strong hand in 9s.

Since I have two 9s, I could bid 5 0s, which is a safe bid. However, I could also bid 5 9s, increasing the quantity without changing the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s, made by Player 2. Based on the game history from the previous round (where the actual count of 9s in the 16 digits was revealed to be 5), I know the current bid is true (5 >= 5). Therefore, I cannot challenge and must make a higher bid. A higher bid must be strictly greater than 5 9s, meaning either a higher quantity (6 or more of any digit) or the same quantity (5) with a higher digit (impossible as 9 is the highest). Thus, I must bid 6 or more of any digit. My hand is 09595149, which contains three 9s. Since the total count of 9s is 5, Player 2 must have 5 - 3 = 2 nines. Bidding 6 9s would be false (actual count 5 < 6), and Player 2 knows the actual count is 5 (as they made the true bid of 5 9s and were present in the previous round), so they would challenge and win. Therefore, I must bid 6 or more of a different digit. All bids of 6 or more of any digit are likely false, as the expected count of any digit in 16 cards is 1.6. Bidding 6 5s requires Player 2 to have 4 5s (since I have two 5s). While unlikely, this seems like a reasonable bluff compared to requiring 5 or 6 of other digits from Player 2's 8-card hand. It's the lowest quantity increase bid on a digit I have multiple of.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. With a total of 16 digits remaining, for the bid to be true, Player 2 must have at least 6 ones in their 8-digit hand. This is statistically very unlikely. The probability of having 7 or more of any single digit in 16 total digits is low (expected count is 1.6). Given the high quantity relative to the total digits and the low probability of Player 2 holding so many 1s, challenging the bid is the most strategic move.
