Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 4 4s in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected count of any digit is around 8.4. As the first bidder, I need to make a valid bid. Bidding 7 4s is a strong opening bid based on my hand's concentration of 4s and is slightly below the statistical expectation for the total count, making it a reasonable and defensible starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 4s in my hand, so the bid of 7 4s requires at least 7 of that digit among the other 40 unknown cards—an event with probability under 10%. It’s too unlikely, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round. My hand is 50444204, containing four 4s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. The statistical expectation for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. Since I hold four 4s, the remaining 36 digits held by other players are expected to contain around 3.6 more 4s (36 * 1/10). This gives a total expected count of approximately 4 + 3.6 = 7.6 4s. Bidding 7 4s is a plausible and slightly conservative opening bid based on my strong hand and the statistical expectation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. Given that Player 1 was eliminated after challenging 7 4s and the bidder won, it's likely there are at least 7 4s. I have two 1s, one 2, one 5 and one 9. Bidding 8 1s seems like a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity. It's more likely to be true than bidding a higher digit with a lower quantity, given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 98913192, I have two 1s. The current bid is 8 1s from Player 2. With 5 active players having 8 digits each (40 total digits), and knowing I have 2 of the 1s, there would need to be 6 more 1s among the other 32 digits held by other players. This is certainly possible, as it would mean about 19% of the remaining digits would need to be 1s, which is higher than the expected 10% for a random distribution but not unreasonable. I could challenge, but it's risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have three 9s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 9s. I'll bid 8 9s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 9s, which is very high. Given my hand (5,7,3,9,7,4,9,6), I have two 9s, so I know there are at least two 9s in total. Bidding higher than 8 9s would require at least 9 9s, which I cannot support with only two in my hand. Bidding on a different digit isn't feasible because the total number of 9s is already quite high, and raising the quantity to 9 seems unlikely. Challenging the current bid is the best move, as the total number of 9s across all hands is unlikely to reach 9, given I only have two 9s and the total digits are limited.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made in the current round, I can start with a bid. My hand contains the digits 5, 7, 3, 9, 7, 4, 9, 6. Counting the digits, I have: 5 (1), 7 (2), 3 (1), 9 (2), 4 (1), 6 (1). The total counts across all players are unknown, but I can estimate the minimum based on my hand. To be safe, I will bid 7 4s, which is a reasonable starting bid considering I have one 4 and the total is 32 digits. This bid is higher than any previous bid (which were 7 4s, 8 1s, 8 9s) and is a conservative opening.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid of 7 4s requires at least 7 total 4s across all 32 digits. I have 1 four in my hand, meaning the remaining 24 digits must contain at least 6 more. Given the expected average of 3.2 total 4s in 32 digits and the statistical improbability of having 6 additional 4s in the other hands, challenging this bid is the optimal move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The previous bid was 'None', meaning no one has bid yet in this round. My hand contains 5, 7, 3, 9, 7, 4, 9, 6. Counting the digits, I have: 3 (once), 4 (once), 5 (once), 6 (once), 7 (twice), 9 (twice). Since no bid has been made, I can start by bidding a reasonable quantity of a digit I hold multiple of, such as '2 7s' or '2 9s'. Given I have two 9s, I will bid '2 9s' to start the bidding, which is a safe, low bid that reflects my hand and encourages others to bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains four 4s (50444204). The current bid is 2 9s. With 24 total digits, the expected count for any digit is 2.4. The bid of 2 9s is not excessively high, but I have zero 9s, making it slightly less likely for me personally that the bid is true (requiring at least two 9s among the other 16 digits). However, challenging carries significant risk (around 48.5% chance the bid is true based on probability). Bidding on my strong suit (4s) is a safer strategy. I have four 4s, so bidding 3 4s, 4 4s, or 5 4s are all valid and likely true bids higher than 2 9s. Bidding 5 4s uses my hand strength effectively and is very likely to be true (probability of at least one additional 4 among the other 16 digits is high, around 81.5%). This puts pressure on the next player with a high-quantity bid based on my known strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. Player 0 has already successfully bid 7 4s and 5 4s in previous rounds, suggesting they likely have several 4s. Bidding higher on 4s is risky. I have three 1s. Bidding 6 1s is a reasonable increase in quantity and seems less likely to be challenged than increasing the quantity of 4s. It's also within the realm of possibility given the remaining digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s, which is quite high considering the total of 24 digits and previous bids. My hand contains one '1', so the maximum total count of '1's across all players is at most 3 (including my own). Bidding higher than 6 1s is impossible given my hand, so challenging the bid is the best move to test its validity and potentially eliminate the previous bidder if the count is less than 6.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 5, 7, 3, 9, 7, 4, 9, 6, which includes two 7s, two 9s, and a few other digits. The previous bids have been aggressive, but since no bid has been made in this round, I can start with a conservative bid. Considering my hand, I have at least two 7s and two 9s, so I can confidently bid 2 7s or 2 9s. To be safer and more strategic, I will bid 2 9s, which is a higher digit and likely to be plausible given the previous bids and remaining total digits.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains four 4s. The current bid is 2 9s. Bidding 4 4s is a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity from 2 to 4. Since I hold four 4s, the total count of 4s is guaranteed to be at least four, making this a safe and strong bid that leverages my hand strength and puts pressure on the opponent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s, and I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains 5, 7, 3, 9, 7, 4, 9, 6. I have one 4 and two 9s. Since I have only one 4, bidding 5 4s seems unlikely. I do have two 9s, so I could consider bidding 3 9s, but that is lower than the current bid of 4 4s, which is invalid. Alternatively, I can challenge the current bid, as the total number of 4s in the game is unlikely to be 4, given the distribution and my hand. Challenging seems the safer move to potentially eliminate the opponent or force a reveal.
