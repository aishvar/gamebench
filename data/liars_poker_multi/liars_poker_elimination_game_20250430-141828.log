Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '1 0s' by Player 0, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have a diverse set of digits in my hand (84102395), I can look for opportunities to increase either the quantity or the digit value. Noticing that I have two '3's and considering the low starting bid, I can reasonably increase the quantity while keeping a relatively low digit to make a safe bid. Bidding '2 3s' seems like a cautious yet progressive move, as it increases the quantity and selects a digit that I have in my hand, thereby slightly increasing the likelihood of the bid being valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 72911742, which contains no 3s. The current bid is 2 3s by Player 1. With 48 total digits across 6 players, a bid of 2 3s is quite low and likely achievable, as it only requires an average of about 0.33 threes per player. I don't have any information on other players' hands, so challenging this bid seems risky. Instead, I will make a higher bid. Since I have two 7s in my hand, bidding 3 7s feels reasonable. This increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a valid higher bid than 2 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains two 0s. The current bid is 3 7s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8. The bid of 3 7s is below average and statistically likely to be true, making a challenge risky. Bidding 4 0s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and is supported by the two 0s in my hand. This bid requires 2 additional 0s from the other 5 players (40 digits), which is statistically likely given the expected count of 4 0s from others.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 5 0s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have a decent chance of it being true. Alternatively, I could bid on another digit I have, like 2 3s or 2 7s, but increasing the 0s bid seems most strategic given the current situation and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 0s. Given that the previous bid was 4 0s and the current bid is 5 0s, it's possible that there are several 0s in play. However, bidding 6 0s seems risky without more information. Alternatively, I could bid 3 7s, but that's lower than the current bid. Since the current bid seems high for 0s and I don't have any 0s in my hand, challenging might be the better option.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I can bid anything. I have one 0, one 2, two 3s, one 6, one 7, and one 8 in my hand. Bidding 1 1s would be a safe opening bid, but I want to try and establish a slightly higher bid to see if anyone will challenge. I have two 3s, so bidding 2 3s seems reasonable. It's a small increase from the previous round's bidding, but it's a valid bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is None, meaning I can bid anything. I have one 3 in my hand. Bidding 2 3s seems like a reasonable starting bid, as it's not overly aggressive and I have some information about the digit. It's also a relatively low number, making it less likely to be challenged immediately.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '2 3s' by Player 4 and considering my hand '84102395', I notice I have one '3'. Since the bid is relatively low and I have a '3' in my hand, increasing the quantity seems reasonable. Also, considering the total digits remaining are 32, and with 4 players, the distribution of digits can vary widely. However, the digit '3' seems like a safe bet to increase the quantity on, given its presence in my hand and the fact that the current bid is not excessively high. Therefore, bidding '3 3s' appears to be a cautious yet strategic move, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same as the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 72911742, which contains one 7, two 1s, two 2s, one 4, and one 9. The current bid is 3 3s made by Player 1. I have no 3s in my hand, which means I contribute nothing to the current bid. With 32 total digits across 4 players, it's possible that there are at least 3 3s in play, as each player could have a few. However, since I have none, I’m slightly skeptical, but not enough to challenge yet. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. I have two 7s, so bidding 4 7s seems reasonable—it increases both the quantity and the digit. This bid is plausible given my hand, and it might force others to either challenge or bid higher, giving me more information.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 2. My hand contains zero 7s. With 3 other players holding a total of 24 digits, the expected number of 7s among them is 2.4 (24 * 0.1). A bid of 4 7s requires the other players to have at least 4 7s, which is significantly higher than the expected count. The probability of having 4 or more 7s in 24 digits is approximately 20%. This implies an 80% chance that the actual count of 7s is 3 or less. Therefore, challenging the bid of 4 7s presents a high probability of winning.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 3 0s is a logical next step, increasing the quantity while staying within the realm of possibility. Bidding a higher digit could be risky as I don't have any strong counts of other digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 3 0s and considering my hand 84102395, which does not contain any 0s, I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Since my hand doesn't provide any direct insight into the quantity of 0s, I must consider the overall game state. With 24 total digits remaining and the current bid being 3 0s, I should think about the likelihood of there being at least three 0s across all players' hands. Given that no player has bid on any digit other than 0s or 3s/7s in this round, and considering the distribution of digits, it might be reasonable to assume that the quantity of 0s could be met or exceeded. However, without concrete evidence from my hand, I must rely on strategic thinking. A higher bid would need to either increase the quantity or the digit value. Considering the risk and the potential for other players to have 0s, I could consider bidding on a different digit that I have more information about or challenging the current bid if I think it's unlikely. Since I don't have any 0s and the bid is relatively low, challenging might be risky without a clear indication that the bid is false. Given these considerations and looking at my hand, I notice I have two 3s and other digits. The safest increase would be to bid on a digit I have knowledge of, but since the current bid is on 0s, and I have no 0s, I must decide based on the game's progression and the fact that we are now down to 3 players with 24 digits in total. Bidding on a digit I have, like the 3, could be a strategy, but I need to ensure it's a higher bid than 3 0s. Since I have two 3s, bidding 4 3s could be reasonable, considering it increases the quantity and moves to a digit I have more insight into.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s, made by Player 1, with 24 total digits remaining. The expected number of 3s in 24 digits is 2.4. A bid of 4 is significantly above this average. I have one 3 in my hand. For the bid to be true, the other two players must hold at least three 3s in their combined 16 digits. The probability of having 4 or more 3s in 24 randomly distributed digits is approximately 21.1%. This means there is approximately a 78.9% chance that the actual count of 3s is less than 4. Challenging the bid offers a high probability of success.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an opening bid. Looking at my hand, 84102395, I have two 3s and no other repeated digits. Since the game has progressed and many players have been eliminated, the total number of digits remaining is 16. Considering my hand and the fact that I want to make a reasonable bid without overestimating, bidding on the digit '3' seems like a good starting point because I have two of them. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and I have two 3s, I can reasonably assume there might be at least one more 3 in the other player's hand, making a bid of '3 3s' a cautious yet potentially valid starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 3s' by Player 4 and my hand '84102395', I notice I have two 3s. Since the total number of digits remaining is 16 and we are down to two players, each having 8 digits, the maximum number of 3s the other player could have is 6 (if they had no other digit but 3s, which is highly unlikely given the bidding history). However, considering the bidding history and the fact that I have two 3s, making a bid that increases either the quantity or the digit seems reasonable. Given that I already have two 3s and considering the distribution of digits, bidding on a higher digit or the same digit with a higher quantity is a strategic move. The safest increase would be to bid on a higher digit since increasing the quantity of 3s to 5 or more might be risky without knowing the exact distribution in the other player's hand. Noticing my hand has a '9', which is a high digit and potentially less common, I could consider bidding on '9s' but given I only have one '9', the risk is high. Alternatively, looking at my hand, I have two '3s' which matches the current digit of the bid, so increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same could be a good strategy. However, since I need to make a strictly higher bid, and given that increasing the digit directly might not be feasible with the information I have, I should consider the balance between the quantity and the digit. The current bid is '4 3s', so the next logical step, considering I want to increase the bid and I have two 3s, would be to either increase the quantity of 3s or move to a higher digit with the same or lower quantity. Given the constraints and aiming to make a reasonable bid, I should consider what is likely to be in the other player's hand and make a decision based on probability and the information I have from the game history.

Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 6 3s and my hand 84102395, which contains one 3, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least six 3s in total across both players' hands. Since each player has 8 digits, and there are only 16 digits in total, the maximum number of any digit can be 16. However, given that I only have one 3, for the bid of 6 3s to be valid, Player 4 must have at least five 3s. Considering the bidding history and the fact that we are down to the last two players with a total of 16 digits, this seems highly unlikely but not impossible. Given that I don't have enough information to confidently challenge, and considering the rules that require a higher bid to be either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit, my best move would be to challenge the current bid as making a higher bid seems risky without more information about Player 4's hand.
