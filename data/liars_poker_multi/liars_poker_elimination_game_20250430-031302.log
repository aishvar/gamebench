Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. With 40 unknown digits and a 1/10 chance for each digit, we expect about 4 more zeros, for a total of around 6 zeros. Opening with 5 zeros is a strong but plausible bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 6 0s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I could potentially have support from other players. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 4 or 7. However, increasing the quantity of 0s seems slightly more plausible given the initial bid. Bidding 5 1s, 5 4s, or 5 7s would also be valid, but 6 0s feels safest.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total), Player 1's bid of 6 0s seems plausible. Since I have a 0, and assuming an even distribution, there could be 7-8 zeros total. I can either bid higher (7 0s) or switch to a different digit. Looking at my hand, I have a lot of low digits. I'll bid 6 1s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit, which I'm confident about since I have two 1s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I can already see two 2s in my own hand, so the current bid of 6 2s is roughly a coin-flip (about 57% likely to be true). Challenging would therefore give me only about a 43% chance to win and risks elimination. A safer play is to raise the bid by the smallest possible amount: keep the quantity at 6 but move the digit up to 3. I hold one 3, so the table would need five more 3s among the remaining 40 hidden digits—a scenario that is still plausible. This passes the pressure to the next player while avoiding an unfavourable challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 50522635, which contains two 5s, one 0, one 2, one 3, and two 6s. The current bid is 6 3s by Player 4. I have one 3 in my hand, so I know at least one 3 exists, but I have no information about the other players' hands. With 48 total digits across 6 players, an average of 4.8 digits per digit (0-9) is expected. A bid of 6 3s is slightly above average but not unreasonable. I could challenge, but it's risky since it's plausible. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Since I have two 5s, bidding on 5s seems safer. I'll bid 6 5s, maintaining the quantity but increasing the digit, which is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 5s. With 40 other cards and p=0.1, the expected number of 5s is only ~4, and the chance of there being at least 6 is under 25%. A bid of 6 5s is therefore unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two zeros in my hand. With 40 total digits, we expect about 4 zeros overall: my 2 plus roughly 3 among the other 32 unknown digits. Bidding 5 zeros only requires 3 more across the other players, making this a safe and reasonable opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 6 0s would be a reasonable increase, though risky. However, given the previous round's challenge and elimination, players might be more conservative. Bidding 6 1s would also be a valid bid, and I have one 1. Bidding 6 2s or higher would be too aggressive without more information. Since I have a 7, I can bid 6 7s. This is a valid bid, and I have one 7 in my hand, so it’s not a complete bluff.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 7s in my hand (40211059). The current bid claims there are 6 7s among all players. With 5 players having 8 digits each, 6 7s is possible but seems high given I know for sure there are none in my hand. That means the other 4 players would need to have 6 7s between them, averaging 1.5 7s per player. While possible, given the aggressive bidding pattern and the fact I can see zero 7s, challenging seems like the better option than raising to 7 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and have visibility of my hand: 40211059. Since I have two 0s in my hand and there are 32 total digits in play (8 per player × 4 players), starting with a conservative bid of 4 0s seems reasonable. This accounts for my two 0s and assumes there are at least two more among the other three players, which is likely given the previous rounds showed multiple 0s in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have my hand (40211059) which contains two 0s. As the first bidder in this round with only 3 players remaining (24 total digits), starting with a conservative bid is wise. Since I know I have two 0s, bidding 3 0s is relatively safe as I only need one more 0 between the other two players to make this true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have no 0s, so challenging 3 0s has roughly a 79% chance of succeeding, but there is still a real 21% risk of elimination. Instead, I hold three 9s (the highest digit). By bidding 3 9s I strictly raise the bid (same quantity, higher digit) and, because I personally possess all three required 9s, any challenge against me is guaranteed to fail. This is a zero-risk way to take control of the bidding while avoiding the elimination risk of a challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I only have one 9 in my hand. Among the 16 unknown cards, the chance of there being at least two more 9s (to make the bid of 3 valid) is under 50%, so it’s slightly more likely that there are fewer than three 9s. The current bid of 3 9s is therefore unlikely, and I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: As the opening bidder I want a statement that is certainly true from my perspective yet forces my opponent into an uncomfortable decision. I hold three 9s, so a bid of 3 9s is guaranteed correct even if my opponent holds none. If they challenge, they lose immediately; if they raise, they must push the quantity higher, making future challenges easier for me.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I can see all 8 of my digits (40211059) and there are no 9s in my hand. The opponent claims there are at least 3 9s total, which means they would need to have at least 3 9s in their hand of 8 digits. While possible, this seems unlikely given that each digit should be roughly evenly distributed. Additionally, Player 4 has been aggressive with their 9s bids in previous rounds. I have enough information to make a calculated challenge.
