Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is the minimum possible: 1 0s. I must make a strictly higher bid. My hand contains the digits 5, 8, 2, 4, 2, 7, 2, 8. I have three 2s and two 8s. Bidding 2 2s is both safe (since I hold three myself) and strictly higher than 1 0s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s is a valid higher bid (increased quantity) and guarantees at least 3 6s in total since I hold them. This bid is truthful and safe, as the total count can't be lower than my own contribution.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. With 48 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 4.8. A bid of 3 6s is statistically very likely to be true, making a challenge risky, especially since I have no 6s myself (meaning the other 5 players need 3 sixes among their 40 digits). I need to make a higher bid. Options are 3 7s, 3 8s, 3 9s, or 4 of any digit. I have two 0s and two 4s in my hand. Bidding 4 0s leverages my hand (I only need 2 more 0s from the other 40 digits) and increases the quantity, putting more pressure on the next player. Player 0 also started with a bid of 1 0s, which might indicate more 0s are present.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 0s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have two 7s and two 5s in my hand, and considering the distribution of digits might not be even, bidding on a higher quantity of a digit I have seems reasonable. However, I must consider the total number of digits remaining and the likelihood of certain digits appearing. Given that 0s are already bid at a quantity of 4, and I don't have any 0s, moving to a higher digit with a reasonable quantity seems like a good strategy. I have two 5s and two 7s, but since 6s have been bid at a quantity of 3, I could try to bid on a digit that is higher than 0 and has a reasonable chance of appearing in the other players' hands. Since my hand contains 5s and 7s, and given the previous bids, I could consider bidding on 5s or moving to an even higher digit if I think it's plausible. However, given that the bid needs to be strictly higher than 4 0s, and without knowing the exact distribution of the other players' hands, a safe increase would be to either increase the quantity or move to a slightly higher digit. Considering all players have 8 digits and there are 48 digits in total, the distribution could be somewhat even, but it's hard to predict without more information. Given my hand and the need to make a higher bid, I could consider bidding on 5s since I have two of them, which might suggest a slightly higher presence in the overall pool, but I must be cautious not to overbid. Since I don't have enough information to safely assume the presence of higher digits in large quantities across all players, and considering my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should look for a balance between the quantity and the digit that seems plausible given the game's state.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. In my hand (58242728), I have zero 6s. Statistically, with 48 digits and 6 players, each digit is expected to appear about 4.8 times. The bid of 5 6s is slightly above expectation, but not unreasonable, so challenging now would be risky. To make a higher bid, I can increase the digit to 7, as I have one 7 in my hand, making it safer for me. Therefore, I will bid 5 7s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. There are 48 total digits across 6 players. The expected number of any digit is 4.8. I have zero 6s in my hand (94501804). This means the other 5 players (40 digits) must have at least 7 sixes for the bid to be true. The expected number of 6s among those 40 digits is 4. While Player 0 and Player 3 have escalated bids on 6s (P0: 5 6s, P3: 7 6s), requiring 7 sixes from the remaining 40 digits when I have none seems statistically unlikely. The bid is significantly above the expected value, making a challenge a reasonable strategic move.

Player 4 Reasoning: It's my turn to start the bidding for this round. I have two 0s and two 4s in my hand (94501804). With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected average count for any digit is 4. Bidding based on my pairs is a safe opening strategy. I have two 0s, so bidding '2 0s' is a truthful and safe starting point. It's also the lowest possible bid for a quantity of 2, giving me flexibility for future bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '2 0s' and my hand '58725758', I notice I don't have any 0s. However, considering the total digits remaining is 40 and there are 5 players, the maximum number of any digit can be is 40 (if all players had the same digit). The bid '2 0s' seems relatively low, but without more information about other players' hands, it's difficult to assess its likelihood. Since my hand doesn't provide a clear advantage for bidding on a specific higher digit, and challenging '2 0s' could be risky if there indeed are at least two 0s among all players, I should consider making a bid that is slightly higher and on a digit I have in my hand. Given my hand has multiple 5s and 7s, and the game history shows bids on these digits, I could try to bid on one of these digits. However, since the current bid is on 0s, and I don't have any, bidding on a digit I have, like 5s or 7s, but with a low quantity might not be the best strategy as it doesn't directly counter the current bid. Instead, I should look to increase the quantity of the current bid or move to a higher digit if I had enough information or digits in my hand to support such a move. Given the constraints and my hand, a reasonable approach might be to slightly increase the bid on 0s or move to a digit I have, but since I lack 0s, moving to a higher digit with a quantity that reflects the potential distribution of digits among players could be a safer bet. Since I have two 5s and the game has seen bids on 5s before, but the current bid is very low, I might consider bidding on 5s with a quantity that reflects a possible distribution given the total number of digits and players. However, the safest increase from '2 0s' without overestimating would be to either increase the quantity of 0s, which I have no information on, or move to a higher digit with a quantity that seems plausible. Given these considerations, and without direct evidence to challenge '2 0s' safely, making a slightly higher bid on a digit I have or can reasonably guess might exist in sufficient quantity seems prudent. But, considering the need to strictly increase the bid and my lack of 0s, I should focus on a digit I can influence or have insight into. Since the current bid is low and on 0s, which I don't have, and considering the distribution of my hand and the need to make a higher bid, I should look for a digit that could plausibly have a higher count than 2 across all players' hands. Given the total number of digits and the fact that each player has 8 digits, bidding on a digit that could reasonably appear more than twice seems like a good strategy. Considering my hand and the game history, I notice that bidding on 5s could be a good option since I have two 5s, but the key is to determine a quantity that is higher than the current bid yet still plausible given the total number of digits and players. Since I have two 5s and there are 40 digits in total, it's possible other players could also have 5s, making a bid on 5s with a higher quantity than 2 plausible. Thus, considering the need for a higher bid, my hand, and the game's context, I decide to bid on 5s with a quantity that reflects a potential higher distribution of this digit among players.

Player 5 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the round and there are no previous bids to consider, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 58725758, I notice I have multiple occurrences of the digit 5 and 7, but also a couple of 8s. Since the goal is to make a bid that is reasonable and has a good chance of being correct, I should consider the digits I have the most of and their potential distribution among other players. Given that I have two 5s and two 7s, and considering the total number of digits remaining is 32, bidding on one of these digits seems like a good starting point. However, since I want to make a bid that is likely to be true and also considering that higher bids are more strategic but riskier, I should aim for a moderate bid. Bidding on the 5s or 7s could be a good strategy since I have a couple of each, but given the history of bids and challenges, it seems that players have been bidding on a variety of digits. I will choose to bid on the 5s because I have two of them, and it's a relatively safe bet considering the total number of digits and the fact that no one has bid yet this round.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 58242728, which contains two 2s and two 8s, and one 5. The current bid is 2 5s. Since I have one 5, it is reasonable to assume that there could be at least one more 5 among the other 24 digits (held by 3 other players). The bid is not aggressive, so challenging is not optimal. I can make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving to 2 8s, which I know I have in my hand and is a safe bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s. Bidding 3 3s increases the quantity while maintaining a lower digit, which is a valid higher bid. Since I have two 3s and there are three other players, it's likely there's at least one more 3 in the game. Challenging the current bid of 2 8s is risky because the expected number of 8s in 24 digits is ~2.4, making the bid plausible.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. With 32 total digits, the expected average for any digit is 3.2. The bid is very close to the average and statistically likely to be true, making a challenge risky, even though I hold no 3s. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 94501804, containing two 0s and two 4s. Bidding based on these strong digits is logical. Possible higher bids include 3 4s, 4 0s, or 4 4s. Bidding 3 4s would only require one more 4 from the other 24 digits (expected 2.4), which is very safe. Bidding 4 0s or 4 4s requires two more of the digit from the other 24 digits (expected 2.4), which is still reasonable and increases the quantity, putting more pressure on the next player. Since 4s haven't been bid this round or the last, and I have two of them, bidding 4 4s seems like a strong strategic move.

Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 4s and my hand of 58725758, which contains no 4s but multiple 5s, 7s, and 8s, I must consider the likelihood of higher bids. Since my hand does not support a bid for 4s, and bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity (4) or increasing the quantity with the same or lower digit is not feasible without more information, I should look for an opportunity to challenge or make a strategic bid. However, given that my hand has multiple instances of digits like 5, 7, and 8, and considering the game's progression and the total digits remaining (32), making a bid that is strictly higher than 4 4s requires careful consideration. Challenging the current bid of 4 4s could be a viable option if I believe it's unlikely, given the distribution of digits I have and the bids that have been made. Since I don't have any 4s and the game has progressed significantly, challenging might be a safer bet than trying to outbid with a higher quantity or digit without sufficient evidence from my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s made by Player 2. I have zero 3s in my hand (94501804). However, with 24 total digits in play, the expected number of 3s is 2.4 (24/10). Challenging a bid of two 3s is therefore risky, as it's statistically likely to be true. I must make a higher bid. My options are to bid 2 of a digit higher than 3, or to bid 3 or more of any digit. My hand contains two 0s and two 4s. Bidding 2 4s is a safe option, as I hold both required 4s. A slightly stronger bid is 3 0s. I hold two 0s, meaning only one more 0 is needed among the remaining 16 digits held by Player 1 and Player 2. The expected number of 0s in those 16 digits is 1.6 (16/10), making it probable that at least one more 0 exists. Bidding 3 0s is reasonably safe, utilizes the strength of my hand (two 0s), and increases the quantity, putting more pressure on the next player.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s made by Player 2. I am Player 4 and my hand is 94501804. I have zero 3s. For the bid to be true, the other two players (Player 1 and Player 2) must have at least three 3s combined in their 16 digits.

Challenging seems risky for such a low bid quantity. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 3 4s, 3 5s, ..., or 4 0s, 4 1s, etc. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding '3 4s' requires only one more 4 among the other 16 digits held by Player 1 and Player 2. The probability of at least one 4 existing in 16 digits is high (1 - (0.9)^16 ≈ 81.5%). This is a safe bid based on my hand. Bidding 4 0s (I have two 0s) or 4 4s (I have two 4s) would require two more of that digit from the others, which is significantly less probable (around 48.6%). Therefore, the safest and most strategic move is to bid 3 4s.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 58242728, which contains two 2s, two 8s, two 4s, one 5, and one 7. The current bid is 3 4s. I have two 4s myself, so it's plausible there could be at least one more 4 among the other 16 digits, but it's not guaranteed. However, since the bid is not extreme and I have strong holdings in 2s and 8s, I can safely make a higher bid. I will bid 3 8s, since I have two 8s and it's likely there is at least one more among the other players.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. My hand contains no 8s, so the remaining two players must account for all 8s. With 16 digits left, the expected number of 8s is 1.6. The probability of fewer than 3 8s is ~74.5%, making the bid likely false. Challenging offers a higher chance of success than bidding higher with uncertain digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: It's my turn to open the bidding with no current bid. My hand is 58242728, which contains two 2s and two 8s (digits: 5, 8, 2, 4, 2, 7, 2, 8). Opening with a bid of 2 2s is a solid start since I know I have exactly two 2s, making it a safe and credible opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 94501804. I have two 0s, two 4s, one 1, one 5, one 8, and one 9. I have zero 2s. The current bid is '2 2s' by Player 1. There are 16 total digits (8 for me, 8 for Player 1). For the bid '2 2s' to be true, Player 1 must hold at least two 2s. Challenging is risky because a low bid like '2 2s' is statistically quite likely to be true (average of 1.6 twos expected across 16 digits). Bidding higher seems better. I have two 0s. Bidding '3 0s' is a strong possibility, requiring only one 0 from Player 1's hand of 8 digits to be true. This is a safe increase based on my hand and puts pressure on Player 1.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. In my hand (58242728), I have zero 0s. For Player 4's bid to be correct, all three 0s must be in their hand. While not impossible, it's unlikely for one player to have three of a single digit in an 8-digit hand. The probability is low enough that a challenge is justified.
