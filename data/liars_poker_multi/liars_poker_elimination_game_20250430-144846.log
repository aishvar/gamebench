Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I can bid anything. I have one 9 in my hand. A conservative bid of 1 9s seems reasonable to start, as it's unlikely anyone has a large number of 9s. It's a low risk opening bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s by Player 0, which is a very low bid and likely to be true since only one 9 is needed across 48 digits. I have one 9 in my hand (from my digits: 36897367), which already supports the bid. However, since the bid is low, I can safely make a higher bid to keep the game moving. I’ll bid 2 9s, increasing the quantity while staying with a digit I have in my hand, making it a reasonable escalation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have two 9s in my hand (95867908). This means the current bid is already met by my hand alone. Challenging is not a good option as it's extremely likely there are at least two 9s across all 48 digits (6 players * 8 digits). The expected number of any digit is 4.8. I must make a higher bid. A higher bid must have a quantity of 3 or more, or stay at quantity 2 with a higher digit (which is impossible as 9 is the highest). Bidding 3 9s is a safe and logical next step. It only requires one more 9 among the other 5 players (40 digits), which is highly probable. This continues the bidding pattern for 9s established by Player 0 and Player 1.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s, and I have two 9s in my hand. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48, and there are still 48 digits remaining, it's plausible that there could be at least 4 9s among all players. Therefore, I will bid 4 9s, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. My hand is 20585132, which contains one 2, one 5, two 8s, and one 3, and one 2, with no 9s. Given that there are 6 players and each has 8 digits, the total count of digits is 48. The bid of 4 9s implies that there are at least four 9s across all hands. I have no 9s in my hand. While it's possible that other players have 9s, the quantity of 4 seems relatively low given the total number of digits is 48 and the digit 9 is not particularly common in the visible hand. However, it's still early to challenge without a strong basis. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, I must increase the quantity. The next possible bid would be 5 0s or 5 9s (though 5 9s is not valid as it doesn't increase the digit). I will analyze the likelihood and choose a bid that is reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. My hand contains one 0. Based on the total number of digits (48) and players (6), the expected number of 0s is 4.8. The bid of 5 0s is slightly above average expectation but plausible. Challenging it would require the total count of 0s to be less than 5, meaning the other 5 players (with 40 digits) must have fewer than 4 0s. The probability of this is less than 50%. My hand contains two 1s. Bidding 5 1s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires at least three more 1s from the other 40 digits. The expected number of 1s in 40 digits is 4, so getting at least three is quite likely. Bidding 5 1s is a safer move than challenging 5 0s or bidding a higher quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Bidding 6 1s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have no information to suggest that there aren't at least six 1s in total. Alternatively, I could bid on another digit I have, like 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 9. However, given the recent history focusing on 9s and then 0/1, sticking with 1s seems strategically sound. Bidding higher on 9s would be risky as the previous bids already went up to 4. Bidding on 0s would be a significant digit change and could be a bluff, but 6 1s feels more grounded.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 36897367, which contains no 1s. The current bid is 6 1s by Player 0. With 48 total digits across all players, a bid of 6 1s is plausible since it's only about 12.5% of the total digits, and I have none myself, so they could be distributed among others. Challenging now feels risky without strong evidence that the bid is too high. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. I have two 3s, two 6s, and two 7s in my hand. Bidding on 7s could be a good choice since I have some, and it allows me to increase the digit while keeping the quantity reasonable. I’ll bid 6 7s, which is higher than 6 1s due to the higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. There are 48 total digits, so the expected average count for any digit is 4.8. A bid of 6 is slightly above average. I have one 7 in my hand, meaning the other 5 players (40 digits) need to have at least five 7s for the bid to be true. This is slightly above the expected average of four 7s in those 40 digits (40/10 = 4). Challenging is an option, but not a clear winner.

Alternatively, I can bid higher. My hand is 95867908. I have two 8s. Bidding 6 8s is a valid next bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires a total of six 8s across all 48 digits. Since I have two 8s, the other 5 players need four 8s among their 40 digits. This is exactly the expected average (40/10 = 4), making it a statistically reasonable and relatively safe bid based on my hand. Bidding 6 9s is also possible (I have two 9s), but 9s were bid heavily earlier, making it slightly less certain. Bidding 7 of any digit increases the quantity significantly above average and feels riskier. Therefore, bidding 6 8s is the most prudent move.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s and one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 6 8s. Since I have an 8, it's likely that there are at least 6 8s in total. However, bidding 7 8s or 6 9s is risky because I only have two 9s. Challenging the bid seems too risky because there are likely at least 6 8s. Instead, I'll bid 7 7s, which is a reasonable increase in digit while maintaining a plausible quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. My hand is 20585132, which contains one 7. So, I have at least one 7. The total count of 7s across all 6 players (each having 8 digits) could be up to 48. The current bid of 7 7s seems relatively low considering the total possible count is 48. I need to bid higher than 7 7s. I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have one 7, and it's likely others do too, bidding 8 7s is reasonable. Alternatively, bidding 7 8s is also a valid move. Given that my hand doesn't have an 8, I'm slightly less confident in 7 8s, but it's still a plausible bid as others might have 8s. I'll choose to bid 7 8s as it adheres to the rule of being a higher bid and seems like a reasonable guess.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 8s made by Player 4. I have zero 8s in my hand. For the bid to be true, the other 5 players must collectively hold at least 7 8s among their 40 digits. The expected number of 8s among 40 random digits is 4. The probability of having 7 or more 8s in 40 digits is low (approximately 3-4%). Given this low probability and my inability to make a strong higher bid based on my hand (I have no 8s and no 9s, and not enough of other digits to bid 8), challenging the bid is the optimal strategy.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s made by Player 5. In my hand (36897367), I have no 1s, which means I contribute nothing to the current bid. However, with 4 active players and 32 total digits, a bid of 2 1s is quite low and likely to be true since even one 1 per player on average would exceed this count. I should make a higher bid to push the game forward. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 6s, and two 7s. Bidding on 7s seems promising as I have two of them, and a higher digit might be safer. I’ll bid 3 7s, increasing both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 2 1s. This is a reasonable escalation based on my hand strength.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. There are 4 players and 32 total digits. On average, there should be about 3.2 of each digit (32/10). I have one 7 in my hand (95867908), meaning only two more 7s are needed among the other 24 digits for the bid to be true. This is statistically likely (24/10 = 2.4 expected 7s), so challenging is risky. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 8s and two 9s. Bidding 3 8s or 3 9s would be very safe, requiring only one more matching digit from the other 24. However, I can make a slightly more aggressive but still plausible bid based on my hand. Bidding 4 8s requires two more 8s from the remaining 24 digits. Since the expected number of 8s in those 24 digits is 2.4, this is a reasonable bid supported by my own two 8s.

My hand is 17622710, containing two 1s, two 2s, and two 7s. Bidding 2 of any of these is very safe, but only a small increase. Bidding 3 of a digit I hold two of (like 1s) requires only one more from the remaining 16 digits held by other players. The expected count for any digit in 16 digits is 1.6, making it likely that at least one more 1 exists (approx. 81.5% chance). Bidding 3 1s is a plausible and reasonable step up from 1 9s.

Since I have no 1s in my hand, the total count of 1s must come from the other players' hands. With 24 total digits across 3 players, it's possible that there are at least 3 1s in the remaining 16 digits I can't see, but it's not extremely likely. However, challenging now might be risky as the bid is relatively low. Instead, I can make a higher bid. I have two 7s, so bidding 4 7s seems reasonable, increasing both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 3 1s.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 36897367, so I have two 7s, two 6s, one 3, one 8, one 9, and no 1s. The current bid by Player 5 is 2 1s. With a total of 16 digits across both players, and knowing I have zero 1s, the bid of 2 1s means Player 5 must have at least 2 1s in their hand for the bid to be true. This is possible, but I can make a higher bid based on my strong count of 7s. Bidding 3 7s is reasonable since I already have two 7s, and it's plausible that Player 5 has at least one 7 in their 8 digits. This bid increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 2 1s, making it a valid higher bid. I’ll avoid challenging since 2 1s is not an unreasonable bid with 16 total digits.

The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 7s.
The total number of digits is 16.
The expected average count for any digit is 16 / 10 = 1.6.
A bid of 3 7s is significantly higher than the average'

Player 5 Reasoning: Player 1 knows my hand (17622710), which contains two 7s. Their bid of 3 7s implies they have at least one 7 in their hand (2 from me + 1+ from them = 3+ total). The probability of Player 1 having at least one 7 in 8 digits is approximately 57%. This makes their bid plausible. However, the probability of Player 1 having zero 7s (which would make the total count 2, winning the challenge) is still approximately 43%. Any valid higher bid I could make (e.g., 4 1s, 4 2s, 4 7s, 3 8s, 3 9s) has a significantly lower probability of being true based on the need for Player 1 to have multiple specific digits (ranging from ~4% to ~18.7% chance of being true). Making a bid that is very likely false is risky as Player 1 will likely challenge and I will lose. Challenging the current bid, despite the slightly less than 50% probability of winning based on pure chance, is the most strategic move given the low probability of any valid higher bid being true.
