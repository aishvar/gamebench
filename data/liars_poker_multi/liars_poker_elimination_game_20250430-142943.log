Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With 48 total digits across 6 players, an initial bid of 4 8s is reasonable considering the average distribution and my own holdings. This starts the bidding aggressively while staying within plausible counts.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have four 8s in my hand, which already matches the current bid of 4 8s. With 40 other digits in play, it is very likely there are more 8s among the other players. Therefore, challenging now would not be wise. I will increase the bid to 5 8s, as this is a safe and logical next step given my strong hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 5 8s, which means there are likely at least 5 eights across all players. Given that there are 6 players with 8 digits each, the probability of having at least 5 eights is plausible. However, since I only have one, I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding higher would require me to increase the quantity or the digit. Since 8 is the highest digit, I can only increase the quantity. Bidding 6 8s seems risky, so I will challenge the bid to see if there are indeed at least 5 eights.

Player 1 Reasoning: I am the first to bid this round. My hand is 89989095, which contains three 9s and three 8s. As the opening bidder, I should make a conservative but credible bid based on my hand. Bidding 3 9s is reasonable since I have all three myself, making it very likely to be true and not overly aggressive.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, so I must increase the quantity. Bidding 4 4s requires only two more 4s among the 32 unknown digits, which is quite likely (over 80% chance).

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 80422320. I have one 4 and three 2s. The current bid is 4 4s.  With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4.  Bidding 4 4s is exactly the average.  I have one 4, so the other 4 players would need to have a total of three 4s for the bid to be true. This is plausible.  I could bid 4 5s (same quantity, higher digit) or 5 0s (higher quantity, lower digit). I have no 5s, so bidding 4 5s is risky based on my hand. I have two 0s, so bidding 5 0s seems more reasonable given my hand and the average distribution.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s made by Player 4. I have one 0 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have many high digits, bidding a higher quantity seems risky. However, I can see that bidding 5 1s or higher would be a reasonable strategy as it's likely that other players have at least one 1. But first, let's evaluate the risk of challenging. Given that there are 40 digits in total and 5 players with 8 digits each, the maximum possible count for any digit is 40. The bid of 5 0s seems plausible but not extremely high. I will choose to bid higher with a moderate increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have two 1s in my hand, so the remaining four players must have at least four more 1s for the bid to be valid. The average expected count for any digit across all 40 digits is 4 (40/10), making 6 1s above average. Given the risk of challenging and the statistical improbability, challenging is justified since the bid likely overestimates the total 1s.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With 32 total digits remaining, the expected count for any digit is 3.2. Bidding 4 8s is reasonable because my own 2 eights suggest others likely hold at least 2 more, making this bid statistically plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 89989095, which contains three 8s. With 32 total digits in play and 4 players, the average would be about 3.2 of each digit, so 4 8s is plausible. Since I personally hold three 8s, it's likely that among the other 24 digits (held by 3 players), there is at least one more 8. Challenging now would be risky. The safest move is to increase the bid by either raising the quantity or choosing a higher digit. My hand contains four 9s, which is strong, so I will bid 4 9s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand. With 32 cards total, the expected number of 9s is about 3.2 and the chance of there being four or more is under 25%. The bid of 4 9s is unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: It's my turn to open the bidding. My hand is 89989095, which contains four 9s and three 8s. Since opening bids are generally conservative and I have a strong holding in 9s, I will start with a moderate and credible bid of 4 9s, leveraging my own hand strength and making it challenging for opponents to immediately challenge or easily overbid.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:3 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand. With only 24 total digits, a bid of 4 9s means that the other two players would need to have an average of 2 9s each, which is possible but not highly probable. Given my lack of 9s and the relatively high bid, challenging seems like a reasonable move to potentially eliminate a player.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have 89989095 in my hand, which contains four 9s and three 8s. Since there are only two players left and I am starting the bidding, I should open with a strong but not reckless bid. Historically, opening with 4 of a digit I have a lot of (like 9s) has worked well and is not easily challenged. Therefore, I will bid 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, meaning Player 1 must have all 4 of the 9s to satisfy the bid. Historical data from prior challenges confirms Player 1 previously had exactly 4 9s in their hand, and since hands persist between rounds unless eliminated, this bid is likely valid. Challenging would result in my elimination. To continue the game, I must raise the bid. Bidding '5 8s' leverages my two 8s and creates a plausible higher quantity bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 89989095, which contains four 9s and three 8s. The current bid is 5 8s. Since I have three 8s, for the bid to be true, Player 0 would need to have at least two 8s in their hand. This is plausible, but not certain. However, since I have four 9s, I can safely increase the bid to 5 9s, which is a strictly higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is guaranteed to be true for at least my hand. This puts pressure on Player 0 and keeps me safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. Since I have no 9s in my hand (81036814), the total number of 9s in play equals Player 1's count. In the previous round (3 players), the actual count for 9s was 4. Since I had no 9s then and Player 4 was eliminated, Player 1's 9s must be ≤4 (as Player 4's 9s were removed). The bid of 5 9s is impossible because Player 1's maximum possible 9s is 4. Challenging guarantees a win.
