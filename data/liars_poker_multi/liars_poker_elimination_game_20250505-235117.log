Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have my 8 digits: 13019105. Looking at my hand, I have: two 1s, one 0, one 3, one 9, one 5. Since I'm starting the bidding and know I have two 1s, it's safe to bid three 1s as there are likely to be at least one more 1 among the other 40 digits held by other players. This is a conservative opening bid that leaves room for the bidding to progress.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have some information about my own hand, I'll analyze it. My hand is 36051410, which contains one 1. The total count of 1s across all players must be at least 2 (one from my hand and potentially one from Player 0's hand who made the initial bid). Bidding 4 1s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. However, considering my hand doesn't have any higher digits in significant amounts, I'll start by increasing the quantity. I'll bid 4 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s, made by Player 4. I have two 0s in my hand (digits '1', '2', '1', '4', '2', '9', '9', '5'). Since the bid is only 1 0s, I can safely raise the bid. I have at least two 0s, so I can bid 2 0s, which is a valid higher bid. Bidding 2 0s increases the quantity without changing the digit, which is acceptable and safe given my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid of '2 0s' is relatively low given there are 40 total digits in play. With 5 active players and my one 0, it's quite likely there are at least 2 zeros total. I can safely bid '2 1s' to move the game forward while keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit. This is a conservative move that builds on my knowledge of having three 1s in my own hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have two 6s in my hand. Given that Player 3 was eliminated for overestimating the count of 6s, it's likely that there are fewer 6s in total. However, bidding on 6s again might be risky. Instead, I should consider bidding on a digit I know exists in fewer quantities, such as 9. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable move, increasing both quantity and digit, and it's unlikely that any player has three 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have two 0s in my hand, which makes the bid of 4 0s unlikely given the total remaining digits. Challenging the bid seems prudent, as the total count of 0s across all players' hands is unlikely to reach 4, considering my own hand and the typical distribution. Bidding higher would be risky since I only have 2 zeros, and increasing the quantity or digit isn't feasible without certainty. Therefore, challenging is the best move.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, and the current bid is very low (1 0s) at the start of the round. With 4 players having 8 digits each, there are likely more 0s in play. Looking at my hand (13019105), I also have three 1s, which gives me good confidence to make a higher bid. Since I know the 1s bid worked well in previous rounds, I'll bid 2 1s - increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Since I don't have a lot of information about other players' hands, I'll play it safe. I can bid 2 2s or 3 1s. Bidding 3 1s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity, and I have some basis for believing there might be more 1s given the current bid and my own hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s made by Player 1. I have two 9s in my hand. Given the bidding history and the fact that there are only 32 digits remaining, bidding 4 9s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit. It's also likely that other players have 9s, making this a strong bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand (at positions 2 and 6). The current bid of 5 0s by Player 4 seems reasonable given that: 1) Player 4 previously bid 1 0s and 4 0s in earlier rounds, suggesting they likely have multiple 0s, 2) The previous round revealed at least 4 0s existed when Player 4 won that challenge, and 3) I personally have two 0s. Given this history and my hand, 5 0s is likely valid. I should bid higher rather than challenge. With 32 total digits remaining, bidding 5 1s is a safe increase, especially since I have two 1s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have one 1 in my hand (36051410). The total count of 1s across all players must be considered. Given that there are 32 digits in total and I see one 1, I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 5 1s in total. Since I have one 1, there are 4 more 1s needed across the other 24 digits (3 players * 8 digits). The previous bidding history suggests that players are being cautious but also trying to bluff or make educated guesses. I should consider bidding higher or challenging. My hand doesn't have a high count of any specific digit except for having one 1. Bidding 5 2s is a valid move as it increases the digit. However, considering the history and my hand, challenging seems risky unless I'm very sure it's a lie. I'll bid 5 2s as it's a higher bid than 5 1s.

Player 2 Reasoning: With 32 digits remaining and 4 players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 8. The current bid is 5 2s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 6 6s is a reasonable increase in both quantity and digit, leveraging the information that 5 2s have already been bid. This bid seems plausible given the remaining digits and the previous bids.

Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. With only 24 total digits across all players (8 each), and given Player 4's conservative opening bid of '1 0s', I can safely bid higher. Based on previous rounds, Player 4 has shown a tendency to bid 0s, suggesting they might have some. Since I have one 0 and there are likely more among the other players, I can safely bid '2 0s'. Alternatively, I could switch to a different digit, but staying with 0s provides information about the actual count if challenged later.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have the hand 36051410, which contains one 0. Given that there are 24 total digits and I have one 0, I can infer that there are at least a few 0s in the game. However, I should be cautious not to overbid. I can bid higher than 2 0s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 0, bidding 3 0s seems plausible if I believe others might have 0s as well. Alternatively, bidding 2 1s is also a valid move as it increases the digit. Considering my hand has multiple digits, I can make an educated guess. I will choose to bid 2 1s as it is a safer increase in the bid by changing the digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: The game has just started with two active players, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 36051410, which contains one 0, one 1, one 3, two 4s, one 5, and two 6s (though the count of each digit isn't directly necessary for the first bid). A reasonable starting bid should be conservative. Given that there are 16 digits in total and I'm starting, a bid of 2 0s seems like a reasonable starting point as it is cautious and doesn't overcommit.

Given that there are 16 digits in total and I have 8 of them, the total count of 1s could be higher than 2. I can see that my hand has a good distribution of digits. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 1, it's plausible that the total count of 1s is more than 2, but bidding 3 1s might be a bit too aggressive without knowing the other player's hand. However, I can bid 2 2s, which is a higher digit with the same quantity, making it a safer and valid bid. Thus, I will bid 2 2s.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have my hand (13019105) which contains one 2. Since there are only 16 total digits between both players, and Player 1 claims there are at least two 2s, this means they must have at least one 2 in their hand for their bid to be true. This is quite possible. I could either bid higher (like 2 3s) or make a slightly riskier bid of 3 1s since I have two 1s in my hand. Given that I have two 1s, bidding 3 1s is a calculated risk worth taking - there's a decent chance Player 1 has at least one more 1 in their hand.

Given that there are 16 digits in total and I have 8 of them, the total count of 1s across both hands must be at least 2 (one in my hand and at least one in Player 0's hand). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I see one 1 in my hand and the bid is 3 1s, it seems somewhat aggressive but possible that the total count could be higher than 3. However, considering the distribution, bidding 4 1s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand (13019105). The opponent claims there are 4 1s total, which means they would need to have at least one more 1 in their hand. Given that we've been bidding on 1s back and forth and I can see three of them, their bid of 4 1s is quite plausible. I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 5, so bidding 4 5s would be risky. The safest play is to increase the quantity of 1s since I know there are at least 3.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s made by Player 0. I have the hand 36051410, which contains two 1s. Given that there are 16 total digits and I have 8 of them, I can count my own digits. The total count of 1s in my hand is 2. To determine if the bid is likely, I need to consider the count of 1s in Player 0's hand. The bid of 5 1s implies that there are at least 5 1s in total. Since I have 2, Player 0 must have at least 3 1s for the bid to be valid. It's possible but I need to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. Bidding higher would mean either increasing the quantity or keeping the quantity and increasing the digit. I can bid 5 2s or 6 1s. Given my hand, I see one 2, so there are 7 other digits in my hand and potentially more 2s in Player 0's hand. However, increasing the quantity to 6 1s seems risky because it implies there are at least 6 1s in total. I have 2, so Player 0 would need to have 4, which is plausible but I should consider the likelihood. Instead, bidding 5 2s is a safer option as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit. I have one 2, so for 5 2s to be true, Player 0 needs to have at least 4 2s. This is a bit of a stretch but not entirely impossible. I'll choose to bid 5 2s as it's a more conservative increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (13019105), I only see one 2. For there to be five 2s total, Player 1 would need to have four 2s in their hand of 8 digits. While possible, this seems unlikely given the bidding pattern and that Player 1 raised from my 5 1s bid (where I actually have three 1s) to 5 2s. Additionally, Player 1's earlier bidding behavior suggests they might be bluffing. With only 16 total digits in play and the unlikelihood of four 2s in one hand, I should challenge.
