Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning it's the first bid of the round. I have one 4, one 5, one 6, and two 0s in my hand. Bidding 1 7s seems like a safe and reasonable starting bid, as it doesn't reveal too much about my hand and is likely to be a valid bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand, making a bid of 2 0s a safe and reasonable choice. Since the current bid is 1 7s (which is correct given my two 7s), challenging would be risky as it would confirm the bid's validity. Bidding higher on 0s leverages my strong position in that digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. In my hand (31993817), I have no 0s, but since there are a total of 48 digits and only a bid of 2, it is very likely that there are at least 2 zeros among all hands. Challenging now would be risky. I should make a minimal higher bid. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 2 1s (next higher digit at same quantity) is reasonable and keeps the pressure low.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 11291262. I have three 1s. The current bid is 2 1s. Since I have three 1s myself, bidding 3 1s is a safe and logical increase based on my hand. This is a valid bid as it has the same quantity but a higher digit than the previous bid of 2 0s, and a higher quantity than the current bid of 2 1s.

Player 4 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (28880756), I have zero 1s. Player 3 has bid 3 1s, which means they believe there are at least 3 ones across all players' hands. Since I don't have any 1s, all 3+ must be in other players' hands. This is certainly possible with 5 other players who could each have some 1s. I notice I have three 8s in my hand, which is a strong digit for me to bid on. I could bid 3 2s (keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit), 3 3s, or even jump to 3 8s based on what I have. Since I'm confident in the 8s, I'll bid 3 8s, which is a valid higher bid than 3 1s by increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s. By raising the quantity to 4 and choosing 7s, I only need one additional 7 among the 40 unseen digits. The probability of at least one 7 in 40 random digits is well over 98%, so this bid is very safe while still beating the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 7s requires either increasing the quantity to 5 or more, or increasing the digit to 8 or higher. Increasing the quantity to 5 or more seems risky given I only have one 7. I have a 4, 5, and 6 in my hand. Bidding 5 6s is a reasonable option, as it increases both the quantity and the digit. Alternatively, challenging seems risky as Player 5 might have more 7s than I anticipate. Therefore, I will bid 5 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have no 6s in my hand (07579400). With 48 total digits, 5 6s would require at least five 6s across all players. Since I have none and prior bids focused on higher digits (7s, 8s) without mention of 6s, it's unlikely the bid is valid. Challenging avoids escalating on a weak bid and tests Player 0's bluff.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand. With 40 digits remaining across 5 players, bidding 4 0s is a conservative estimate since I already hold three and the average distribution suggests at least one more 0 likely exists.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 31993817, which contains no 0s. The current bid is 4 0s. With five players and 40 digits total, it's possible but not highly probable that there are at least four 0s. However, it's early in the round, and making a minimal higher bid is low risk. I will bid 4 1s, since I have one 1 in my hand, and it's a safe incremental increase that keeps the pressure on.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand (11291262). The current bid is 4 1s. Since I have three 1s, it's very plausible that one of the other four players has at least one 1, making the total count at least 4. Bidding higher on 1s is a reasonable move given my hand strength in that digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (28880756), I have zero 1s. The current bid is 5 1s by Player 3. Since I have no 1s, there would need to be at least 5 1s among the other 4 players' 32 digits. This is certainly possible, but I need to decide if I should challenge or make a higher bid. Given that Player 2 bid 4 1s and Player 3 raised to 5 1s, it suggests they might have some 1s in their hands. I have three 8s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 8s. I could bid 5 8s, which would be higher than the current bid of 5 1s because the digit is higher. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity and bid something like 6 0s, since I have one 0 in my hand. I'll go with 5 8s since I have strong evidence for it in my own hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have four 7s in my hand and zero 8s. The current bid of 5 8s could easily be true (I don’t help disprove it), so challenging carries real risk. Instead, I can leverage my strong count of 7s: by bidding 6 7s I raise the quantity (from 5 to 6) and shift to a digit I’m holding abundantly. I would then need only 2 more 7s among the other 32 unknown digits; the probability of that is roughly 84%, giving me a much better safety margin than challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid of 6 7s requires at least four more 7s across the remaining 32 digits (4 other players). Given the focus on other digits in previous bids (0s, 1s, 8s) and the likelihood that Player5 may be bluffing (as higher 7s holdings would be rare), challenging seems strategically favorable. If Player5 has 3 or fewer 7s, the total would fall short of 6, leading to their elimination.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I start the round and need to make the opening bid. My hand alone contains four 7s (4,7,9,7,7,7,2,2). With 24 unseen digits still in play, the chance that at least one more 7 exists is very high (over 90% even under average distribution, and last round there were 8 sevens in 40 digits, indicating 7s may be plentiful). Therefore an opening bid of 5 7s is highly likely to be valid while still giving me room to raise later if needed.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 31993817. Counting the 7s in my hand, I have one 7. With 4 players and 8 digits each, there are 32 digits total. The current bid is 5 7s, which means there must be at least 5 sevens among all hands. Since I only have one, there would need to be at least 4 among the remaining 24 digits (in the hands of Players 3, 4, and 5). Statistically, the expected number of any given digit in 24 random digits is about 2.4, so 5 7s is a plausible but slightly aggressive bid. However, it is not unreasonable enough to challenge at this stage. To make a higher bid, I can either raise the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s and two 3s, so I can bid 5 9s, which is a safe incremental bid based on my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 1s and three 2s in my hand. The current bid is 5 9s. A bid of 6 1s or 6 2s seems reasonable given my hand and the number of players remaining. Bidding 6 1s is a safer bet than 6 2s because I have more 2s, which I might be able to leverage later.

Player 4 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (28880756), I have zero 1s. Player 3 has bid 6 1s, meaning they believe there are at least 6 ones among all 32 digits. Since I have none, all 6 would need to come from the other three players' hands (24 digits total). While this is possible, it seems somewhat high given that the expected count of any digit across 24 random digits would be 2.4. I could bid 6 2s, 6 5s, 6 6s, 6 7s, 6 8s, or 6 9s to continue, or 7 of any digit. Given that I have two 8s in my hand, bidding 6 8s seems reasonable as I'm already contributing 2 toward that count. This keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit value, which is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I hold zero 8s. For Player 4’s bid of 6 8s to be valid, the remaining 24 hidden digits (3 players × 8) would need to contain at least six 8s—an occurrence rate of 25%. With a uniform 10% chance per digit, the probability of seeing 6 or more 8s in 24 trials is roughly 3%. This makes the bid extremely unlikely, so challenging offers a far better than 90% chance to win while a further bid would expose me to higher risk.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first to act this round. In my 8-digit hand I already hold four 7s (7,7,7,7). By opening with a bid of 4 7s I guarantee the bid is true, so I cannot lose a challenge. From the other players’ perspective, the chance that there are at least four 7s in the 24 total digits is only about 21%, making the bid look risky and potentially tempting them to challenge and lose. It is a safe yet aggressive opening that leverages my strong holding.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 31993817. Counting 7s, I have one (the last digit). The current bid is 4 7s, meaning there must be at least four 7s among the 24 digits. I know there is only one in my hand, so there would need to be three more among the other two players' 16 digits. The expected count of any single digit in 24 random digits is about 2.4, so 4 is a plausible but slightly aggressive bid. However, with only one 7 in my hand, I cannot confidently challenge yet. Instead, I will make a higher bid based on my hand's strength: I have three 9s (positions 2, 4, and 5). Bidding 4 9s is a safe and legal raise, as it matches the quantity but increases the digit.

With 24 total digits, the expected number of 9s is 2.4 (24 * 0.1). A bid of 4 9s is slightly above the expected value but not outrageously high, especially considering Player 2 might have multiple 9s. I have three 1s and three 2s. Bidding 5 1s or 5 2s would be a safe increase based on my hand strength. Bidding 5 1s is a valid higher bid than 4 9s (higher quantity).

Player 5 Reasoning: I have four 7s in my hand (47977722). To satisfy a bid of five 7s I only need one more 7 among the 16 unknown digits held by Players 2 and 3. The probability that there are zero additional 7s in 16 random digits is 0.9^16 ≈ 18%, so I have roughly an 82% chance the bid is true if challenged. Challenging the current bid of 5 1s is riskier; Player 3 has repeatedly bid on 1s, suggesting they hold several, making the bid more likely to be correct. Therefore, raising to 5 7s is the safer move while still beating the current bid (same quantity, higher digit).

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have the hand 31993817, which contains one 7. With only 24 digits in play and only one 7 in my hand, for there to be at least five 7s, the other two players must have a combined four or more 7s. This is statistically unlikely, as the expected number of 7s per hand is about 2.4 (24 digits / 10 digits = 2.4 per digit). The prior challenge history shows that overbidding is often punished, and 5 7s is a bold bid for three players. Therefore, I should challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first bidder this round and I know I personally hold four 7s (7,7,7,7). This guarantees that there are at least 4 sevens among the 16 total digits. From my opponent’s perspective, however, seeing an opening bid that high is statistically unlikely (≈7 % chance), so they are quite likely to challenge — and if they do, I win automatically.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s by Player 5. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand is 11291262, which contains zero 7s.  With only 16 total digits, a bid of 4 7s means Player 5 is claiming they have at least four 7s in their hand, or a combination of theirs and mine. Since I have zero, Player 5 would need to have all four. While possible, it's a significant portion of their hand.  Given the previous history where Player 5 successfully bid 5 7s and 5 7s again, they might actually have a strong hand of 7s. However, challenging at 4 7s seems like a reasonable risk given I have none.  If I bid higher, I'd have to go to 5 of something, which is risky with only 16 total digits and my hand composition. Challenging seems like the better play here.
