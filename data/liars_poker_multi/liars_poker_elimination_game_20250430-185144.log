Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first bidder and the current bid is None. I need to make a valid starting bid. My hand is 18708858. I have three 8s, one 1, one 7, one 0, and one 5. A safe starting bid is usually based on what you have plus a reasonable estimate for the other players. With 6 players and 8 digits each, the average count for any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8. Since I have three 8s, bidding 4 8s seems like a strong and likely bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s. Raising to 5 1s only needs two more 1s among the other 40 unknown digits, which has over 90% probability, making this a safe legal bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. My hand contains three 2s and two 6s. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total digits), the expected count for any digit is around 4. My count of 2s (3) is high, suggesting a higher total count is likely. Bidding 6 2s increases the quantity from the previous bid (5) and is well supported by my hand (3) plus the expected count from other players (~4), making a total expectation of around 7. Bidding 6 2s is a conservative move based on my hand strength and the overall digits remaining. Challenging 5 1s is risky as 5 is not an extremely high bid for 48 digits, even though I have zero 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. With 48 total digits and my hand containing no 2s, the expected total number of 2s across all hands is 4.8 (48/10). Since 4.8 < 6, the bid is statistically unlikely to be valid. Challenging this bid has a high probability of success.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round, so I must make a bid higher than 'None'. My hand contains three 2s, which is my most frequent digit. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. Bidding 4 2s is a reasonable starting bid, close to the average expectation and supported by the three 2s I hold.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. The expected average number of any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. So, 4 2s is statistically plausible. I hold one 2 in my hand (33364452), meaning 3 more 2s are needed among the other 32 digits for the bid to be true. Challenging seems risky as the bid is not excessively high. Player 2 also won a challenge on 6 2s last round (though with more digits in play), suggesting they might be confident. I have three 3s in my hand, which is a strong holding. Bidding 4 3s is a safe and logical increase. It leverages my hand strength (I only need one more 3 among the other 32 digits) and is only a minimal increase over the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: In my hand of 28756169, I have no 3s. The current bid claims there are at least 4 3s among all players. With 5 players having 8 digits each (40 total), and knowing I have zero 3s, the other 4 players would need to have at least 4 3s between them. While this is possible, I have information that makes it less likely: 1) My hand shows a good distribution of other digits, suggesting 3s aren't particularly concentrated, 2) The bid history shows conservative bidding patterns (4-5-6 range), indicating players aren't seeing large concentrations of digits. I'll challenge this bid as it seems statistically unlikely given my knowledge.

Player 4 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round. My hand is 33364452, containing three 3s. With 4 players and 8 digits each, there are 32 total digits. The expected average count for any digit is 3.2. Since I hold three 3s, it's highly probable that there is at least one more 3 among the other 24 digits held by the other players. Therefore, bidding '4 3s' is a statistically safe and strong opening bid based directly on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 18708858. I have three 8s and one 7, one 0, one 5, one 1. The current bid is 4 3s.  I have zero 3s. With 32 total digits, a bid of 4 3s is roughly average (32 / 10 digits = 3.2 expected per digit).  Given I have no 3s, and the bid is already at 4 3s, challenging seems risky as it's a plausible bid. I have three 8s, so bidding on 8s is a strong option. I can bid 5 8s, which is a higher quantity than the current bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have 0 eights in my hand and there are only 24 unknown digits. Even if distribution is uniform, we’d expect about 2–3 eights among them, making 5 eights very unlikely (probability under 10%). I should challenge Player 0’s bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I hold three 1s in my hand. With 16 other digits unseen and an expected 1.6 ones among them, there's roughly an 81.5% chance of at least one more 1. Starting with 4 1s is a strong but plausible bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains three 2s (56263292). The current bid is 4 1s. A bid of 4 2s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Since I already have three 2s, I only need one more 2 to be present among the other 16 digits held by the other two players (Player 1 and Player 4). This is a very likely scenario. Challenging 4 1s is risky as it's a plausible bid, and I have zero 1s, meaning the count depends entirely on the other players. Bidding 4 2s is a much safer move based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I hold one 2 in my hand (33364452). This means the bid requires at least three 2s among the remaining 16 digits held by Player 1 and Player 2. The expected number of 2s in those 16 digits is 1.6 (16 * 0.1). Needing three is somewhat unlikely, making a challenge plausible. However, I have three 3s in my hand. Bidding 4 3s requires only one more 3 among the other 16 digits. The expected number of 3s is 1.6, making it highly probable that at least one more 3 exists. Bidding 4 3s is a strong, safe bid based on my hand and forces Player 1 into a difficult position.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this head-to-head round with 16 total digits. My hand is 33364452. My strongest digit is 3, with three occurrences. The opponent (Player 2) has 8 digits. Statistically, the expected number of 3s in the opponent's hand is 8 * (1/10) = 0.8. However, calculating probabilities, the chance of Player 2 having at least one 3 is 1 - (0.9)^8 ≈ 57%. Therefore, bidding 4 3s (my 3 + at least 1 from opponent) has a reasonable probability of being true. This bid leverages my strongest holding. I have also successfully bid 4 3s and won challenges in previous rounds, establishing credibility for holding 3s. It's a strong opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s by Player 4. My hand contains three 2s (56263292). Bidding 4 2s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, lower digit is not allowed, but 4 2s is lower than 4 3s, so this is not a valid bid. I must bid higher. Let me re-evaluate. Higher means higher quantity OR same quantity but higher digit. 4 2s is NOT higher than 4 3s. My mistake. I need to bid 4 4s or higher digit, or 5 0s or higher quantity). Okay, let's re-evaluate valid bids higher than 4 3s: 4 4s, 4 5s, 4 6s, 4 7s, 4 8s, 4 9s, 5 0s, 5 1s, 5 2s, etc. My hand has three 2s, one 3, one 5, two 6s, one 9. Bidding 4 4s (need 4 from Player 4) is unlikely. Bidding 4 5s (I have one, need 3 from Player 4) is possible. Bidding 4 6s (I have two, need 2 from Player 4) is more plausible. Bidding 4 9s (I have one, need 3 from Player 4) is possible. Bidding 5 2s (I have three, need 2 from Player 4) increases the quantity and seems reasonable based on my hand. Bidding 5 6s (I have two, need 3 from Player 4) is less likely. Bidding 4 6s seems like a strong option based on my two 6s, requiring two more from Player 4's 8 digits. Bidding 5 2s is also strong, requiring two more 2s when I have three. Given the history of Player 4 successfully bidding 4 3s, challenging seems very risky. Bidding 4 6s is a valid and plausible bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 2. I hold one 6 in my hand (33364452). For Player 2's bid to be true, there must be at least three more 6s among the remaining 8 digits held by Player 2. The total number of digits is 16. The expected number of 6s across all 16 digits is 1.6. The probability of Player 2 having 3 or more 6s in their 8-digit hand is statistically low (approximately 3.8% based on binomial probability assuming random distribution). Player 2's jump from my 4 3s bid to 4 6s seems like a potential bluff. While I could bid 5 3s (as I hold three 3s), challenging the current low-probability bid seems like the better strategic move to potentially win the game immediately.
