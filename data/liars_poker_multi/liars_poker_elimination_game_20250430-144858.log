Player 0 Reasoning: I have the digits 3, 2, 7, 7, 8, 1, 9, 6 in my hand. The digit 7 appears twice, which is the highest count of any digit I have. Since there are 48 digits total among all players, starting with a bid of 2 7s is a reasonable and conservative opening bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. With 48 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 4.8. A bid of 2 is extremely low and highly likely to be true, so challenging is not a good option. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 98088352, which contains three 8s. Bidding on 8s leverages my hand strength. A bid of 3 8s is higher than 2 7s (increased quantity). Since I hold three 8s myself, this bid is guaranteed to be true based on my hand alone, making it a very safe and strategic move.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which means there needs to be at least two more 8s among the other five players. Given that the bid is relatively low and I have one 8, it's plausible that there are at least two more 8s in the other players' hands. To keep the game going, I'll make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 9, which I also have one of in my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s, meaning there are at least three 9s across all hands. My hand contains the digits 5, 7, 2, 8, 6, 5, 3, 1. I have one 8, which I can contribute. Since the total number of 9s is at most 8 (one per hand), it is highly unlikely that there are 3 or more 9s. Challenging the bid seems the best move to eliminate an opponent.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have four 3s in my hand, which is a strong starting point. Since the current bid is None and I'm the first to bid in this round, I can set a moderate bid to put pressure on other players. Bidding 5 3s is reasonable given my hand and the total digits in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand of eight digits. With 5 players having 8 digits each (40 total), and the bid claiming there are 5 3s, this seems plausible. Given I have one 3, the other players would only need to have 4 3s between them (about 1 per player) to make this bid valid. Since the bid is reasonable and I don't have strong evidence to challenge, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, so bidding '5 5s' (same quantity, higher digit) would be a strategic move based on my knowledge.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 45420417. I have one 5. The current bid is 5 5s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. A bid of 5 5s is slightly above average, but not exceptionally high. I have one 5, so I know at least one exists. Based on the average and my hand, challenging seems risky as 5 5s is plausible. I need to bid higher. I have three 4s. Bidding 6 4s increases the quantity and is supported by my hand, making it a reasonable next bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. I need to bid higher, either by increasing the quantity or by bidding the same quantity with a higher digit. I have one 7 in my hand, which is higher than 4. Bidding 6 7s is a valid and reasonable move, as the quantity remains the same but the digit is higher, and having a 7 increases the plausibility of this bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. There are 5 players and 40 total digits, so the average expected count for any digit is 4. A bid of 6 is above average but not excessively high. I have zero 7s in my hand (98088352), which slightly decreases the likelihood of the bid being true, making a challenge tempting. However, I have three 8s. Bidding 6 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). With three 8s in my hand, needing only 3 more from the remaining 32 digits across other players makes 6 8s a statistically plausible and well-supported bid. This leverages my strong hand in 8s and puts pressure on the next player, Player 2. Challenging 6 7s carries the risk of elimination if the count is 6 or more, while bidding 6 8s is a safer, proactive move based on my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand. The current bid is 6 8s. Bidding a higher quantity (7) with a lower digit (3) is not allowed, but I can bid the same quantity (6) with a higher digit (9). However, since I have no 9s in my hand, this seems risky. Given that the current bid is already high (6 8s), and with only 40 digits in total, it's unlikely there are 6 8s across all hands. I should challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 3. With 32 total digits and 4 players, the bid of 4 3s is quite reasonable. Given my hand also has two 5s, I can make a strategic bid of 4 5s, which keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit. This is a safe move as I can account for half of those 5s myself.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have two 4s and one 5 in my hand. With 32 total digits, a bid of 4 5s is plausible (average is 3.2 per digit). I have a strong hand for 4s (two of them). Bidding 5 4s increases the quantity and is a safe bid given my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have one 4 in my hand, which doesn't strongly support a higher quantity of 4s. To make a higher bid, I must bid at least 6 of any digit or 5 of a digit higher than 4. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 5 7s is valid and plausible. Bidding 6 of any digit might be risky without strong evidence. Therefore, bidding 5 7s is a reasonable step to increase the bid while staying cautious.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand. The current bid is 5 7s by Player 0. Given that there are 32 digits in play and I already have three 3s, it's plausible that there are at least six 3s in total. Bidding 6 3s is a higher bid than 5 7s because it increases the quantity.

Player 4 Reasoning: Looking at my hand, I have only one 3. For there to be six 3s total among all players, the other three players would need to have five 3s between them. While possible, this seems unlikely given: 1) The bidding pattern suggests Player 2 might be bluffing by jumping from 5 7s back to 6 3s, 2) Player 2 made a successful challenge earlier showing good judgment, which might make them overconfident now, 3) With only 32 total digits remaining, having 6 of any single digit is getting into risky territory. Given these factors and having only one 3 myself, I should challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: I'm starting this round with 8 digits in my hand: 05716951. I can see one 5, which is a middle-value digit. Since I'm opening the bidding, I should start conservatively but not too low. With 24 total digits in play and my one 5, bidding 3 5s is reasonable - it only requires two more 5s among the other 16 digits held by other players. This is a safe opening bid that leaves room for the bidding to progress.

I have one 5, so the other two players would need to have a total of at least two 5s for the bid to be true. This is possible but not guaranteed.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have one 4 in my hand, but no 5s. To increase the bid, I can either increase quantity or digit. The next valid bids after 4 4s are 4 5s or 5 0s. Since I have no 5s, bidding 4 5s is risky. Bidding 5 0s is a big jump in quantity and risky without any zeros in my hand. Given the current bid is modest and my hand has only one 4, the bid of 4 4s seems plausible. I will raise conservatively to 4 5s, hoping the total count of 5s is at least 4.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand (5,5). The current bid claims there are 4 5s total among all players. With only 3 players remaining and 8 digits each, the maximum possible 5s is 24. Given I have 2 of them, Player 0 would need to be claiming there are at least 2 more 5s between themselves and Player 5. While possible, this seems reasonable enough that challenging would be risky. Since I can't bid the same quantity and digit, I need to either increase the quantity to 5 or keep 4 but increase the digit. Given my hand also has a 6,7,9, bidding '4 6s' seems like a safe play as I have evidence of at least one 6.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (implied by the digits 45420417, which doesn't contain a 6, but the digits are 4, 5, 4, 2, 0, 4, 1, 7. I misread my hand initially. My hand is 45420417. I have three 4s, one 5, one 2, one 0, one 1, and one 7. I have zero 6s. The current bid is 4 6s. There are 24 total digits. On average, each digit should appear 2.4 times (24 / 10). A bid of 4 6s is plausible but not guaranteed. Given my hand has no 6s, and the bid is already 4, challenging is a reasonable option as it's above the average expected count for a digit. However, Player 4 made this bid, and they might have several 6s. Looking at the history, Player 4 has been involved in several bids and challenges. They bid 4 5s previously, and now 4 6s. Bidding 5 4s is a strong option as I have three 4s in my hand, making a total count of 5 or more 4s across all three players quite likely. This also increases the quantity from the current bid of 4 6s.

While possible, the previous bidding pattern and the fact that Player 0 raised to this after my 4 6s bid suggests they might be bluffing.

Since there are only two players and a total of 16 digits, the average count for any digit is 1.6. Player 4's bid of 2 5s is slightly above average probability. I have one 5, so Player 4 would need at least one 5 for the bid to be true. Given I have three 4s, bidding 3 4s is a safe and higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand of 05716951, I have only one 4. Since there are only 16 total digits between both players (8 each), and Player 5 claims there are at least 3 fours total, they must have at least 2 fours in their hand for their bid to be true. While possible, this seems unlikely given the previous bidding patterns. Since I can see only one 4 and would need two more to exist in their hand of just 8 digits, I think challenging is the better option than raising the bid.
