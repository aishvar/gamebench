Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I should make a conservative opening bid based on what I know from my hand. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding '3 1s' is relatively safe since I only need one more 1 among the other 40 digits held by other players. Starting with a low digit gives room for others to bid up.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have 8 and 5 in my hand. The current bid is 3 1s. I can make a reasonable bid by increasing the quantity and digit, so I'll bid 4 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand contains one 8, so I cannot bid 5 8s. The highest quantity I can confidently bid is 4, but since the current bid is already 4, I need to increase the digit to make a valid higher bid. Bidding 4 9s would be higher in digit, but I have no 9s. Bidding 4 8s is not valid since it's not higher. Bidding 4 7s is lower in digit and invalid. The only option is to challenge, as raising the bid isn't possible with my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have a 9 in my hand. Considering the previous bids, 4 8s was challenged and failed, and 3 1s was made by Player 0. Given my 9, I can bid 1 9s, which is a reasonable increase in digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s. My hand contains two 9s (73696928), so I know for certain that the total count of 9s across all players is at least two. Therefore, challenging the bid is not possible as I would lose. I must make a higher bid. A higher bid requires either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since the current quantity is 1, I must bid at least 2 of any digit. Bidding 2 9s is a valid higher bid, directly increases the quantity from the previous bid, and is guaranteed to be true based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have two 6s in my hand. I know that Player 1 and Player 3 have at least one 9, and I have one 9. I suspect that Player 0 and Player 4 do not have a 9. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have zero 6s. The current bid claims there are at least 4 sixes among all players (40 total digits). Given that I can see there are none in my hand, and each player has 8 digits, the bid of 4 6s seems reasonable but risky. The previous round revealed there were 7 eights, suggesting players might have clusters of similar digits. Since I can't see any 6s in my hand, and 4 is a moderate quantity that would require other players to have multiple 6s, I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and there are 32 digits remaining across 4 players (8 digits each). The previous highest bids were 4 6s, which was successful, and 3 0s. Since I have two 6s, and there is a good chance other players also have 6s, I should bid slightly higher than the previous successful bid of 4 6s. Bidding 5 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Since I have only one 6, I should increase the digit to 7 as it's the next highest possible digit, given my hand. Bidding 1 7s seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. While 6 6s is higher than the average expected count (3.2), it's not statistically impossible, and challenging carries the risk of immediate elimination if the bid is true. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 6 9s is a valid higher bid and is somewhat supported by my hand (I need 4 more 9s from the remaining 24 digits, which is statistically similar to the current bid needing 4 more 6s from the remaining 24 digits from my perspective). Making a plausible bid is strategically safer than challenging a borderline bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 6s and one 0 in my hand. There have been some high bids on the digit 6, with the last bid being 7 0s. While I have a 0, bidding on 0s seems risky due to the high bid and the fact that I only have one. Challenging the 7 0s bid seems more strategic, as it is likely that there are not 7 0s among all players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None'. I have two 6s in my hand. Given that there are 24 digits remaining across 3 players, a bid of 3 6s seems reasonable as a starting point, increasing the digit based on what I have in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Since the current bid is low, especially considering the total digits remaining, I should bid a higher quantity or digit to increase my chances of winning.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains two 6s and two 9s. The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 1. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires at least two more 9s among the other two players' 16 digits. Based on probability, needing two of a specific digit from 16 is quite plausible. Bidding 5 6s would require three more 6s from the other hands, which is less likely than needing two 9s. While challenging 4 6s has some probability of success (I have two 6s, so it requires at least two more 6s from the others), the game history shows 6s being bid high, suggesting they may be concentrated in other hands. Making a plausible bid based on my hand feels safer than challenging at this point.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. With only 24 digits remaining, it's unlikely that there are 4 9s in total. Player 1 and Player 3 have already bid on 6s, so bidding on 6s might not be wise. Challenging the current bid seems like the best move.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. We are in a 2-player game, so there are 8 digits not in my hand. I know that there are at least 6 6s in total (current bid of 6 6s). I need to make a higher bid. I could bid 7 6s, but that would be risky if I'm wrong, and I would be eliminated. I also have a 5 in my hand, and I know there are at least 5 6s.
