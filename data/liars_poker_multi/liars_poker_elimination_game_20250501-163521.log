Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. I have two 6s, one 9, one 5, two 1s, and two 2s in my hand. A conservative bid would be 1 0s, but I can make a more informed bid. I have two 6s, so bidding 1 6s is safe. Increasing the digit is better than increasing the quantity initially, as it's less likely to be challenged immediately. I'll start with a small bid of 1 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 1 6s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have one 6 in my hand (from the digits 49986318), and considering the low quantity of the current bid, increasing the quantity seems like a reasonable approach. Bidding 2 6s would be a safe increment, as it only requires one more 6 to exist across all players' hands beyond what Player 0 has bid. Given that each player has 8 digits and there are 6 players, the total number of digits is 48, providing ample room for additional 6s beyond the initial bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. With 48 total digits and uniform distribution, I expect roughly 4 more 6s among the 40 unknown digits, giving about 5 total. Raising to 3 6s is a safe, valid increase above 2 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. The expected number of any digit across 48 digits is 4.8, so 4 6s is a plausible bid, making a challenge risky, especially since I have zero 6s in my hand (meaning the other players are more likely to have them). I must bid higher. My hand contains two 8s. The expected total number of 8s across all players is around 4.8, and with my two, the expected number among the other 5 players is 4. Bidding 5 8s is a strong, plausible bid that is well supported by my hand and the expected count, and it is a valid higher bid than 4 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '5 8s'. Looking at my hand (67552054), I have 0 eights. Player 4 has bid that there are at least 5 eights among all players' hands. Since I have none, all 5 would need to be distributed among the other 5 players. This is certainly possible - each player could have 1 eight on average. The bid doesn't seem unreasonable yet. I could bid '6 8s', but that would be risky since I don't have any 8s myself. I could also increase the digit and bid something like '5 9s', but I don't have any 9s either. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, which gives me some confidence. I'll bid '6 5s', increasing the quantity but dropping to a lower digit, which is a valid move and leverages my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Given the history, the bidding on 6s and 8s has been aggressive. Bidding 7 5s is possible, but risky. I could also bid on another number. I have two 6s, so bidding 5 6s would be a valid, but not particularly strong, bid. However, given that the previous bids focused on 6s, and I have two, it's likely someone else has at least a few as well. Bidding 6 6s would be reasonable. Alternatively, challenging seems risky as 6 5s is plausible. I will bid 6 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 6 6s and my hand containing one 6, I must assess the likelihood of there being at least six 6s among all players. Since each player has 8 digits and there are 6 players, the maximum number of any digit is 48. The bid of 6 6s seems plausible but not excessively high, considering the total number of digits in play. However, without more information about other players' hands, it's challenging to accurately estimate the total count of 6s. Given that I only have one 6 and the bid history shows a progressive increase in the quantity of 6s bid, I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. Since the current bid is already at 6 6s, making a higher bid would require bidding at least 7 of any digit or the same quantity with a higher digit, which is not possible since 6 is the highest digit. Therefore, my best option is to challenge the current bid, as making a higher bid is not feasible under the game's rules.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None'. I have two 6s in my hand. Given the previous round involved aggressive bidding on 6s, and I have some, I'll start with a conservative but valid bid of 2 6s. This is a reasonable starting point to test the waters without overcommitting.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 9s in my hand, so bidding exactly 2 9s is guaranteed safe (the total count is at least my two). It’s strictly higher than 2 6s (same quantity, higher digit) and forces the next player to raise the quantity to 3 if they want to continue.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains two 8s. The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 3. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, the expected count for any digit is 4. Bidding 5 8s is a valid higher bid (quantity 5 is greater than quantity 3). This bid is well-supported by my hand (I have 2 of the required 5) and the expected distribution among the other 4 players (32 digits, expected 3.2 eights). Challenging 3 9s is risky as the expected count of 9s across all players is 4 (1 in my hand + 3.2 expected from others), which is greater than the bid quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (67552054), I have zero 8s. The current bid is 5 8s from Player 4. With 5 players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits in play. For there to be 5 8s, and none in my hand, the other 4 players would need to have an average of 1.25 8s each. While possible, Player 4 making this bid might indicate they have several 8s in their hand. I could bid higher, such as 5 9s or 6 0s, but I don't have many of those digits either (just one 0). Given that I have two 5s in my hand, I could reasonably bid 6 5s, as this would mean there need to be 4 more 5s among the other 32 digits the other players have, which is plausible. However, I notice I already bid 6 5s in the previous round, so players might remember this and be suspicious. Instead, I'll bid 6 6s since I have one 6 in my hand, and there were at least 7 6s in the previous round with 6 players, so there should be at least 5-6 6s remaining with 5 players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 7 6s would be a reasonable next step, as it increases the quantity while maintaining the digit. However, given the history of challenges and the fact that Player 1 was eliminated challenging a 6 6s bid, it's possible someone has a large number of 6s. Bidding higher could lead to a loss. Instead, I will challenge the current bid of 6 6s. It seems ambitious given the previous challenge and elimination.

Player 5 Reasoning: I'm starting this round with my hand containing 67552054. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, one 7, one 6, one 0, one 4, and two 5s. Since I'm the first to bid in this round, I should make a strategic opening bid. I want to bid on a digit I have multiple of to increase my confidence. I have two 5s in my hand, which means there could be more 5s among the other players. A conservative but reasonable opening bid would be '3 5s', suggesting there's at least one more 5 among the other 24 digits held by other players, which is quite likely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I hold two 8s. With 32 total digits among 4 players, the expected number of any digit is 3.2. The current bid is slightly above this average. Since I hold two 8s, the other 3 players (with 24 digits) only need a combined total of two more 8s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 8s in 24 digits is 2.4, so 4 8s is quite likely to be true. Challenging is too risky. I must bid higher. Bidding 5 8s requires 3 more 8s from the remaining 24 digits. The previous bids of 3 8s (Player 2) and 4 8s (Player 3) suggest that 8s are likely present in other hands, making 5 8s a reasonable and strategic next bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '5 8s' made by Player 4. Looking at my hand (67552054), I have one 8. For the bid to be valid, there need to be at least 4 more 8s among the other 3 players' hands. That's possible but somewhat high. From the game history, I notice Player 2 bid '3 8s' and Player 3 raised to '4 8s' before Player 4 went to '5 8s'. This suggests they might have some 8s in their hands. However, I also notice I have three 5s in my hand, which is a strong holding. I could bid '5 9s' to raise the digit while keeping the same quantity, or I could bid '6 0s' to increase the quantity. Since I have a 0 in my hand, and the bid of '6 0s' is reasonable with 32 total digits (expecting about 3.2 of each digit), I'll go with that option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand contains two 8s. With 24 total digits among 3 players, the expected number of 8s is around 2.4. My hand increases the expected total to 2 (my hand) + 1.6 (expected from 16 unknown digits) = 3.6. The bid of 4 8s is only slightly above this expected value. Based on probability alone for the 16 unknown digits, there is approximately a 51.5% chance that the other two players have less than two 8s combined, which would make the total count less than 4 (my 2 + <2 = <4). This suggests challenging has a slight probabilistic edge. Making a higher bid, such as 5 8s (requiring 3 more 8s from 16 unknown digits) or 4 9s (requiring 3 more 9s from 16 unknown digits), would have a significantly lower probability of being true (around 21%). Given the marginal nature of the current bid relative to the expected count and the risk of making a highly improbable bid, challenging is the preferred move.
