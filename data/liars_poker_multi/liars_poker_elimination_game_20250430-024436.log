Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I should start with a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand. I have three 6s and two 4s, which are my most frequent digits. Starting with '3 6s' gives me some flexibility for future rounds and is supported by my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have the hand 12658393, which contains one 6. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since I have one 6, it's plausible that there are at least 3 6s in total among the players. I will increase the quantity to make a higher bid. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it is a slight increase and still within a plausible range given the total number of digits is 48.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 71048762, which contains one 6. The current bid is 4 6s by Player 1, up from Player 0's bid of 3 6s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an average of about 4.8 digits of any one number is expected across all hands. I only have one 6, which is below average, making the bid of 4 6s seem plausible but not overly high. I don't have strong evidence to challenge, as it's possible other players have multiple 6s. Therefore, I will make a higher bid to continue the game. I'll bid 5 6s, increasing the quantity, as it's a reasonable escalation based on the average distribution.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48, and 5 6s seems plausible, I should try to beat the current bid by bidding a higher quantity or the same quantity but a higher digit. However, given my limited information about other players' hands, I don't have enough evidence to challenge the bid. Therefore, I will bid a higher quantity of 6s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand. Given the history of bidding, it appears players may be bluffing. While challenging is an option, I want to test the waters slightly. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 1 8s is a safe, low bid that is higher than the current bid and doesn't commit me too much if it's a bluff.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 6 6s. Bidding 7 6s would be risky as it requires at least 7 total 6s. Bidding a higher digit with the same quantity is also reasonable. I have two 8s, so bidding 6 8s is a viable option, increasing the digit while maintaining the quantity. Given the history of escalating bids on 6s, it's likely someone has a few, but 6 8s seems plausible without being overly aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (42198073), I have one 8. The current bid is 6 8s made by Player 4. With 6 active players and 8 digits per player, there are 48 total digits. For the bid of 6 8s to be valid, there need to be at least 6 8s among all players. I have 1, so there would need to be 5 more among the other players. This is possible but getting somewhat risky as the bid increases. Looking at the bidding pattern, it seems players have been increasing quantities of 6s until Player 4 switched to 8s at the same quantity. I could bid 7 8s, but that would be risky without knowing more about the distribution. I could also switch to a different digit with quantity 7, or keep the same quantity but increase the digit to 9. Since I have one 9 in my hand, I'll bid 6 9s, which is a valid higher bid than 6 8s by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (44679665), I have two 6s and one 9. The current bid is 6 9s. There are 48 digits in play, so on average, each digit appears about 4.8 times. For there to be at least 6 nines, the other 5 players must collectively have at least 5 nines (since I have one). This is plausible, but not highly likely, as it would require the other players to have more than average. However, the bid is not outrageous enough to guarantee a win if I challenge, so it's safer to make a higher bid. I will bid 7 6s, since I have two 6s myself and 6s have already been bid up to 6, suggesting others may also have 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have the hand 12658393, which contains one 6. So, I have a total of 1 six in my hand. The total count of 6s across all players must be at least 7 (since the current bid is 7 6s), and I know that I contribute 1 to this count. The remaining count of 6s should be distributed among the other 5 players, meaning they must have 6 sixes in total. Given that there are 40 digits remaining with the other players (5 players * 8 digits each), having 6 sixes is plausible but not certain. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Increasing the quantity to 8 6s seems a bit high because it would mean the other players have 7 sixes, which is a relatively high concentration. However, bidding 7 7s or 7 8s or 7 9s is a viable option as it keeps the same quantity but increases the digit. I will choose to bid 7 7s because it is a reasonable increase in digit and I have one 7 in my hand, making it somewhat plausible that the total count could be around 7.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 71048762, which contains two 7s. The current bid is 7 7s by Player 1. Since I have two 7s myself, and there are 48 total digits across 6 players, it's plausible that there are at least 5 more 7s among the other 40 digits (an average of about 1 per player). Given the bidding history, players have been increasing bids steadily, and 7 7s doesn't seem overly aggressive. I’ll make a higher bid to continue the game rather than challenge. I can bid 7 8s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have one 8 in my hand, which gives me some confidence, though it’s still a risk. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to 8 7s, but that feels too aggressive since I only have two 7s. I’ll go with 7 8s as a safer incremental bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 9 8s is a reasonable increase, though it relies on others also having 8s. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. However, given the recent bidding history focusing on 6s, 7s, and 8s, it's likely someone has a few 8s. Increasing the quantity of 8s seems like the most logical next step. Bidding 8 9s would be a viable alternative, but I have no 9s in my hand, making it a pure bluff.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '9 8s' made by Player 4. Looking at my hand (42198073), I have one 8. For the bid to be valid, there need to be at least 8 more 8s among the other 5 players' hands. That's an average of 1.6 8s per player, which is possible but getting high. The bidding history shows multiple players were comfortable bidding on 8s (Player 2 bid 7 8s, Player 3 bid 8 8s, and now Player 4 bid 9 8s), suggesting they might have 8s in their hands. However, I can either challenge or make a higher bid. If I bid, I could go to '9 9s' (I have one 9 in my hand) or increase the quantity to '10' of some digit. Since I have one 9 and one 8, bidding '9 9s' seems reasonable as it's marginally better than challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 9s. In my hand, I have two 6s, two 4s, one 7, one 9, and two 6s (total: 2 4s, 3 6s, 1 7, 1 9). I have only one 9. With 48 digits in play, the average per digit is 4.8. For 9s, 9 out of 48 would require almost two per player, which is above average. Since I only have one 9 and the prior bids ramped up quickly, it's unlikely there are 9 nines among all hands. Therefore, I should challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (from 12658393). The total count of 6s across all 5 players (40 digits) is likely more than 3. I can bid higher than 3 6s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s, it's reasonable to believe there are more than 3 6s in total.

Since I only have one 6, it’s possible but not highly likely that there are at least 3 more 6s among the other 32 digits. However, bidding history shows a tendency to incrementally increase bids, and challenging at this relatively low bid of 4 6s feels risky as it’s still plausible. I’ll make a higher bid of 5 6s to keep the game moving and test the waters, as it’s a reasonable increase based on average distribution.

To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I see one 9 in my hand, and given that there are 3 other players, it's plausible that there are at least 3 nines in total. However, bidding more than 3 9s might be risky. I can bid 4 9s or switch to a higher digit with the same quantity, which would be 3 Xs where X > 9, but since digits only go up to 9, I cannot bid a higher digit. Thus, my best action is to increase the quantity to 4 9s. This seems reasonable given the context and my hand.

With 32 total digits across 4 players, it's possible but not highly likely that there are 4 or more 9s in play, especially since I have none. However, bidding history shows a pattern of aggressive bidding on higher digits, and previous challenges have succeeded when bids seemed overly optimistic. I could bid higher, like 5 9s, but that feels risky given I have no 9s myself. Alternatively, challenging seems reasonable since the probability of 4 or more 9s is uncertain but potentially low.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 44679665, which contains three 6s and two 7s. The current bid is 3 7s. Since I have two 7s, it is possible Player 2 has at least one 7, making the bid plausible. Challenging here is risky because it's likely that there are at least three 7s between both hands. To raise, I can either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity and pick a higher digit. I have three 6s, so bidding 3 8s would be riskier as I have none, and increasing the quantity on 7s would be dangerous. The best move is to bid 3 8s, keeping the quantity but raising the digit, as Player 2 may not have many 8s.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 71048762, which contains one 7, one 8, and no 9s. The current bid by Player 0 is 3 8s. Since there are only 16 total digits in play across both hands, I know I have one 8, leaving a maximum of 15 other digits. For the bid of 3 8s to be true, Player 0 must have at least 2 8s in their hand. This is possible, but I can make a higher bid to test their confidence. I will bid 4 8s, as it increases the quantity and keeps the digit the same, which is a valid higher bid. This bid is plausible since it's still within the realm of possibility (I have 1, so Player 0 could have up to 3), and it puts pressure on Player 0 to either challenge or bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 44679665, which contains two 6s and one 8. The current bid is 4 8s. Since I only have one 8, Player 2 would need to have at least three 8s for the bid to be valid. The probability of Player 2 holding three or more 8s in their eight digits is low, especially since I have only one. Challenging is the best move here.
