Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. As the first bid, assuming at least one more 5 exists among the 5 other players (40 digits), 3 5s is a conservative and plausible starting bid. This allows room for escalation while being supported by my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I hold three 5s, so the current bid of 3 5s is already guaranteed. Raising to 4 5s only requires one more 5 among the 40 unknown digits, which has over a 98% chance of occurring. This is a safe, minimal increase.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand, but not enough to increase the quantity. I can increase the digit to a higher number. I have one 6 in my hand, so bidding 4 6s seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher than '4 6s' or challenge it. Looking at my hand (78628126), I have one 6 in my hand. With 6 players having 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For there to be at least 4 sixes, there would need to be at least 3 more sixes among the other 5 players' hands. This is certainly possible. Given that I have one 6, I'll assume the distribution of 6s is somewhat even, meaning there could easily be 4 or more total. I could bid '4 7s', '5 6s', or another higher bid. Since I have two 7s and one 8 in my hand, bidding '4 7s' seems reasonable as I'm contributing half of those myself.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. Bidding 5 0s increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This is a reasonable move based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 98226444, which contains no 0s. The current bid is 5 0s by Player 4. With 48 total digits across 6 players, a bid of 5 0s is plausible since it's only about 10% of the total digits, and I have no information about others' hands. Challenging now seems risky as the bid isn't excessively high. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. Since my hand has two 4s, two 2s, and one each of 9, 8, and 6, I’ll bid on a digit I have some of, to make my bid more defensible if challenged. I’ll bid 5 2s, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit from 0 to 2, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I hold two 8s in my hand. To reach a total of five 8s, I need three more among the 40 unknown digits. The expected number of 8s in those 40 is 4, and the probability of seeing at least three is about 78%, making this a strong bid. Raising to 5 8s also limits opponents to higher digits or increasing quantity.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s made by Player 1. I have 0 8s in my hand, but I can increase the digit to 9s. Since I don't have any 8s, I should aim for a higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of '5 9s'. Looking at my hand (78628126), I have zero 9s. The current bid claims there are at least 5 nines among all 48 digits. With 6 players having 8 digits each, this is possible but becoming less likely. Since I have zero 9s in my hand, all 5 claimed 9s would need to be in the other 5 players' hands (40 digits total). The probability of this isn't extremely low, but it's getting risky. I could bid '6 0s' since I have one 0 in my hand, but that's also risky. Given that the bidding has escalated quickly to high quantities and we're now at 9s (the highest digit), I think challenging is the safer option here rather than pushing to a higher bid with limited information.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I'm starting a new round and need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (78628126), I have: one 1, one 2, two 6s, one 7, and one 8. Since I have two 6s in my hand, that's a good starting point. With 5 players each having 8 digits, there are 40 total digits. Assuming a roughly even distribution, each digit would appear about 4 times. Given that I already have two 6s, it's reasonable to estimate there might be 4-5 total 6s across all hands. A conservative opening bid would be 3 6s, which is likely to be true while giving me room to maneuver in future rounds.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 98226444, which contains no 0s. The current bid is 4 0s by Player 4. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, it's possible that there are at least 4 0s across all hands, as each player could have a few. However, since I have none, I need to assess the likelihood. The previous round's bidding history doesn't provide specific insight into 0s, and Player 4 escalated from 3 6s to 4 0s, which might be a bluff to shift the digit. I could challenge, but it's risky as 4 0s is not an unreasonable bid with 40 digits. Instead, I’ll make a safer bid of 4 2s, leveraging the two 2s in my hand, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. My hand contains two 5s, which are higher digits than 2s. Bidding 4 5s is a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit). This leverages my existing 5s while increasing pressure on others to either match or challenge. Challenging 4 2s is risky since I have one 2, and others might have enough to meet the bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: Current bid is 4 5s. I hold two 8s, so bidding 4 8s needs just two more 8s among the 32 unknown digits (≈84% chance). This is a minimal same-quantity raise and more credible than increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (78628126), I have one 8. The current bid is 4 8s from Player 1. With 5 players having 8 digits each (40 total digits), I need to assess if there are likely to be at least 4 8s total. Since I have 1, we need 3 more among the other 4 players (32 digits). That's about a 3/32 chance per remaining digit, which makes it reasonably possible. Given my hand also has two 1s and two 2s, I could bid 5 1s or 5 2s, but Player 5 already bid 4 2s, suggesting they might have some 2s. I'll play it safe and bid 5 1s, which increases the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s made by Player 4. In my hand, I have two 2s out of my 8 digits, which contributes to the total count. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, an average distribution would suggest about 4 of each digit across all hands. A bid of 5 2s is slightly above average but plausible. However, since the bid is only marginally higher than expected, I can safely raise it to 5 3s or higher. I have no 3s in my hand, but I’ll bid 5 3s to keep the bid conservative while still increasing the digit. Alternatively, I could challenge, but with my two 2s, the bid of 5 2s is not unlikely enough to risk elimination. Bidding seems the safer option.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. To bid 3 8s I need only one more 8 among the 24 unknown digits (Players 0,3,4), with probability 1–0.9^24 ≈ 92%. This is a safer raise than 3 6s or 3 7s and more plausible to opponents than jumping to quantity 4. Therefore I bid 3 8s.

Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (78628126), I have one 8. The current bid is 3 8s by Player 1. Since there are 4 active players with 8 digits each (32 total digits), and I have 1 of the 8s, there need to be at least 2 more 8s among the other 24 digits held by other players. This is quite possible. I could challenge, but it's risky since the probability of having 2 more 8s among 24 digits is reasonable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 1s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 1s. I'll bid 3 9s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '4 5s' made by Player 1. Looking at my hand (78628126), I have zero 5s. For the bid to be valid, Player 0 and Player 1 would need to have at least 4 5s between them. From the bidding pattern, Player 0 bid '3 5s' which suggests they likely have at least 1-2 5s in their hand. Player 1 increased this to '4 5s', which could mean they have 2-3 5s, or they're bluffing. Given that I have zero 5s, and we need 4 total, it's certainly possible but not guaranteed. I could challenge, but it's a bit risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 2s, two 6s, one 7, and one 8. I could bid '4 6s' to increase the digit, or '5 1s' or '5 2s' to increase the quantity. Since I have two 6s, bidding '4 6s' seems safest as I only need 2 more 6s between the other players to make it valid.

Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (78628126), I don't have any 5s. Player 0 has bid 3 5s, which means they're claiming there are at least 3 fives between our combined hands of 16 digits. Since I have zero 5s, all 3 would need to be in Player 0's hand. This is possible but not guaranteed. I could challenge, but it's a reasonable bid that could be true. Instead, I'll make a higher bid based on what I know I have. I see I have two 1s, one 2, two 6s, two 8s, and one 7. I could bid 3 6s (raising the digit) or 4 1s (raising the quantity). I'll go with 3 6s since it's a safer bid that only requires Player 0 to have one more 6 beyond my two.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have no 6s in my hand, and the probability of Player 3 having three or more 6s in their 8-digit hand is very low (~3.7%). Challenging is statistically favorable as the actual count is likely less than three. Even if Player 3 has two 6s, the total would be two, making the bid false.
