Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I begin the round and must place the first bid. My hand contains three 9s (19947896). With 40 unknown digits among the other five players, the chance that at least one more 9 exists is very high (about 98%), so a bid of 4 9s is extremely safe while still giving me some room to maneuver later.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. My hand contains one 9, two 1s, and one of each of 0, 4, 5, 7, 8. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8. A bid of 4 9s is plausible, making a challenge risky at this stage. I must bid higher, meaning a quantity of at least 5. I have two 1s in my hand. Bidding 5 1s requires the other 5 players to collectively have 3 1s (an average of 0.6 per player), which is less than the overall average expectation of 0.8 per player. This makes 5 1s a reasonable bid based on my hand and probability.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since I have one 1, it's plausible that there are at least 5 1s in total. However, bidding more than 6 1s seems unlikely given the distribution. I can bid 5 2s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. My hand contains two 2s, making it plausible that there are at least six 2s across all players (including my two). Bidding 6 2s increases the quantity while maintaining the same digit, leveraging my hand's contribution. Challenging 5 2s is riskier, as others might hold additional 2s not visible to me.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. My hand contains two 3s, and bidding 6 3s is a valid higher bid since it maintains the same quantity (6) but increases the digit (3 > 2). This leverages my existing cards while adhering to the rules.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. Bidding higher than 6 3s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. I have two 9s, so bidding 4 9s is possible, but Player 0 already bid 4 9s. I have one 8, so I could bid 1 8s, but that's a weak bid. I have one 4, so I could bid 1 4s, also weak. I have one 5, so I could bid 1 5s, also weak. Since the current bid is 6 3s and I have no 3s, and I don't see a strong opportunity to bid higher, I will challenge. It's unlikely there are six 3s given the previous bids and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is None, meaning I can bid anything. I have two 9s in my hand. Player 0 previously bid 4 9s in the last round. Bidding 5 9s is a reasonable starting bid, leveraging the information from the previous round and my own hand. It's a slight increase in quantity, and I have some of the required digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold three 9s. For the current bid of 5 9s to be wrong, there would have to be at most one 9 among the 32 unknown digits—roughly a 15% chance—so challenging is risky. By raising to 6 9s, the table only needs a total of three more 9s in those 32 digits, which occurs about 64% of the time. This is a safe, incremental increase that keeps the bid credible while upping the pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. This is above the average expected count for 40 digits (4), but not excessively high, especially if the previous bidder (Player 0) has a strong hand in 9s, which their bidding history on 9s might suggest. Challenging carries risk if the count is 6 or more. My hand contains two 1s. Bidding 7 1s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity than 6 9s) and is supported by the pair of 1s in my hand. This seems like a reasonable and safer move than challenging at this point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s. I have two 1s in my hand (00665318). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 40 total digits and 7 1s are already bid, it's plausible that there are at least 8 1s or a higher digit count. I see that I have two 1s, so the total count of 1s must be at least 2 (mine) plus whatever the other players have. I will increase the quantity to make a higher bid. Bidding 8 1s seems reasonable as it is a slight increase in quantity.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:1 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s. I have one 1 in my hand, meaning at least 7 more 1s would need to exist in the other 4 players' hands. Given 32 digits across 4 players, 7 additional 1s is unlikely (probability of ~7/32 ≈ 22%). The previous challenge on 6 3s succeeded, suggesting bids may be inflated. Challenging 8 1s offers a high chance of winning if the bid is false.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to set a reasonable starting bid. My hand contains three 0s, which is a strong foundation. Bidding 4 0s accounts for my three and assumes at least one more 0 exists in the remaining 24 digits across three players. This is a conservative yet plausible starting point given the total digits (32) and my hand composition.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. Given that there are only 32 total digits remaining across 4 players (8 digits each), and Player 3 just bid 4 0s, it's plausible but not overwhelmingly likely. However, considering the history of successful challenges in previous rounds, and my lack of 0s, challenging seems like the best option. A higher bid would be risky without knowing the distribution of 0s in other players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is None. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 5 9s is a reasonable starting bid, as it leverages the cards I hold and is a relatively safe bid given the limited number of players remaining. It's higher than any previous bids and doesn't seem overly aggressive.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:0 - o3-2025-04-16) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I can see 3 nines in my own 8-digit hand. That leaves 16 unknown digits (8 from Player 1 and 8 from Player 5). For the bid of 5 9s to be true, at least 2 of those 16 unknown digits must be 9s. With a random distribution, the expected number of 9s in 16 digits is only 1.6; the chance of there being 2 or more is a bit under 50%. So it is slightly more likely that the bid is overstated. Any legal raise would have to be 6 of some digit, and even 6 9s would need 3 extra nines in the unknown 16 digits, which is only about a 20% chance. Challenging gives me the best odds of success.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is None, meaning I can bid anything. I have two 9s in my hand. Given the limited number of total digits (16) and the fact that there are only two players left, a high bid of 9s seems reasonable, as it's likely my opponent doesn't have many. Bidding 7 9s is a strong opening bid given my hand and the game state.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s made by Player 5. There are 16 total digits between the two active players. My hand contains one 9. In the previous round (3 players, 24 digits), Player 5 bid 5 9s and the actual count revealed was 6. This strongly suggests that Player 5's hand contains a significant number of 9s. Given that the total count was 6 with 3 players (including my 1 nine), it is highly probable that Player 5 currently holds 5 nines (1 + 5 = 6). If the total count of 9s is 6, then Player 5's bid of 7 9s is false. While it's possible Player 5 has 6 or more 9s in their hand, the previous round's outcome makes it more likely the total is still around 6. Bidding higher would require a quantity of 8 or more, which is very risky with only 16 total digits and no strong concentration of any digit in my hand (max two 1s). Challenging based on the historical data seems like the best strategic move.
