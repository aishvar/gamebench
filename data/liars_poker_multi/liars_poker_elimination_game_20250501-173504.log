Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning I can make any initial bid. I have 8 digits in my hand: 4, 3, 7, 4, 1, 9, 5, 0. I see that I have two 4s, which is a good starting point. Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 2 4s seems reasonable as it's the highest quantity of a single digit I have in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The bid is at 2 4s. Looking at my hand (11206168), I have zero 4s. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, so 48 total digits. The probability of finding at least 2 fours among the other 40 digits I can't see is quite high. I could challenge, but it's a very low bid that's likely to be true. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have two 1s, one 0, one 2, zero 4s, zero 5s, two 6s, and one 8 in my hand. I could bid on 6s since I have two of them, which gives me confidence. A reasonable bid would be '3 6s', which is higher than '2 4s' in both quantity and digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which is reasonable given the number of players and digits remaining. However, bidding higher on 6s is risky since I only have one. Instead, I can bid on a different digit I have more of, such as 5s. I have three 5s, so bidding 4 5s is a strategic move, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity reasonable.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s, which means there are at least 3 more 5s among the other 5 players (40 digits). While possible, it's a bit risky. I can either challenge or make a safer bid. I have two 6s, so bidding 3 6s would be a valid higher bid, but it's not strictly higher than 4 5s (same quantity, higher digit). Bidding 4 6s is a safer option, increasing the quantity and digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s, and I have the digits 7, 9, 1, 4, 5, 9, 3, 5. Counting my 6s: I have none. The previous bid of 4 6s seems unlikely to be accurate given my hand and the total digits. Since the total number of 6s is probably less than 4, challenging the bid is a good strategy to potentially win if the bid is false. Challenging now puts pressure on the previous bidder to reveal the actual count or be eliminated.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Since the current bid is None and I am the first to bid in this round, I should make a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 2 6s is a safe starting point, as I know there are at least two 6s in the game (from my hand).

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I could bid 3 6s, but that might be risky. I could also bid 3 of a lower digit, but I don't have a strong read on any other digit. I'll bid 3 0s, as it's a safe increase and 0s are generally less common.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s made by Player 5. I have 8 secret digits: 43741950. I see that I have one 0 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40 and there are 5 active players with 8 digits each (total of 40 digits), bidding a high quantity is risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding 1 4 seems too low compared to 3 0s. I should consider bidding a higher digit with a reasonable quantity or challenging if I think the bid is unlikely. Given that I have two 4s and one 0, and considering the total digits and current bid, bidding 4 4s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (11206168), I have zero 4s. The current bid is 4 4s. To assess this bid, I need to consider how many 4s might exist across all players. With 5 active players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. I have zero 4s, so there are at most 32 4s among the other players (assuming every other digit they have is a 4, which is extremely unlikely). From the game history, I know that in the previous round, Player 0 bid 2 4s, which suggests they might have at least one 4. However, bidding 4 4s means there should be at least 4 4s total. Since I have none, and the distribution of digits is generally random, this bid seems reasonable but not certain. I could challenge, but it's a bit risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, and we know from the previous round that there were at least 6 6s total (when Player 3 bid 4 6s and won the challenge). Even though some players have been eliminated, it's likely there are still several 6s in play. I'll bid 5 6s, which is higher than 4 4s in both quantity and digit value.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have three 6s in my hand, which makes a bid of 6 6s reasonable and higher than the current bid. Challenging seems risky because there are enough digits remaining and other players have shown a tendency to bid high.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 6 6s, which is already quite high. Given that there are 40 digits in total and 5 players, the average count per digit is 4. A bid of 6 6s is above average but not impossible, especially since the previous challenge revealed 6 6s in the last round. However, with only two 6s in my hand, it's risky to bid higher. I think challenging is the safer option here.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand. The last round ended with a challenge on 6 6s, which was correct. This suggests that 6s are more common. However, I have no 6s, and the last successful bid was 2 6s. Bidding 3 5s seems reasonable since I have three 5s and it's a higher digit than the last successful bid of 2 6s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I don't have any 5s in my hand. I could bid 3 6s, but that's only a small increase. I could bid higher, but I don't have much information to base it on. Given the limited digits remaining (32), I'll cautiously raise the bid to 4 0s. This is a safe bid as I have a 0 in my hand. It is also the start of the round so I don't need to challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s made by Player 5. My hand contains one 0 and I have no information about other players' hands. However, given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 32 total digits remaining, a bid of 4 0s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid. My hand is 43741950, which means I have one 0, one 4, one 5, and one 9. I also see that Player 2 previously bid 3 5s. Since I have one 5, I can try to bid higher on 5s or 0s. Bidding 4 5s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity from 3 to 4 and utilizes the digit I have in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (11206168), I have zero 5s. Player 0 has bid 4 5s, which means they believe there are at least 4 fives among all players. Since I have none, all 4+ would need to be in the other players' hands. This is certainly possible with 24 other digits in play (8 each from Players 0, 2, and 5). However, I notice that Player 2 previously bid 3 5s, suggesting they might have at least one 5. Player 0 only increased the quantity by 1, which could indicate they have at least one 5 as well. Given this information, 4 5s seems reasonable and I shouldn't challenge. I should make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 4 6s (same quantity, higher digit) would be a safe move based on my knowledge.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have three 5s in my hand, and there have been no bids on 5s higher than 4 5s. I can increase the digit to 7, which is higher than 6, while keeping the quantity the same. This seems like a reasonable bid given the history and my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s made by Player 5. I have 8 secret digits: 43741950. I see that I have one 0 in my hand. Considering the total digits remaining is 32 and there are 4 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. Given that the bid is 5 0s, and assuming other players might have a few 0s as well, this bid seems somewhat plausible but on the higher side. However, I also notice that I have multiple higher digits. Since my goal is to either make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should consider if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more strategic. The current bid is quantity 5 and digit 0. To make a higher bid, I need either a higher quantity or a higher digit. I can bid a higher digit with a reasonable quantity. For example, bidding 5 1s or higher digit with lower quantity, like 4 1s, could be strategic. But first, let's evaluate if challenging is more beneficial.

The current bid is 5 1s, meaning Player 0 claims there are at least five 1s among all players' hands. With 4 active players having 8 digits each (32 total digits), this is certainly possible. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, so there would need to be four more 1s among the other three players to make the bid valid. This is reasonable. I could challenge, but it's risky since the bid is plausible. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 6s. I'll bid 5 6s, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit value, which makes it a valid higher bid.

Bidding 6 7s seems reasonable, increasing both the quantity and the digit. Challenging 5 6s seems risky, as there are three 6s in my hand alone, and there could easily be more among the other players' hands.

If I assume Player 5 has at least 2 zeros (which could be true since they bid 4 0s), and Player 1 has no zeros (worst-case for them), that would leave 20 digits for Player 1 and me.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 3/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. There are only 2 players left (Player 0 and myself), with 8 digits each for a total of 16 digits. Player 0 has bid '3 0s', meaning they believe there are at least 3 zeros in total between our hands. Looking at my hand (11206168), I have exactly 1 zero. This means Player 0 must have at least 2 zeros in their hand for their bid to be valid. This is entirely possible, so challenging might be risky. Since I have one 1 and two 6s in my hand, I could bid '3 1s' (same quantity but higher digit) or increase the quantity to '4 1s' or '4 6s'. I'll go with '3 1s' as it's a safer bid that I know is true based on my hand having at least one 1.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s made by Player 1. My hand contains one 1, and since there are only 16 digits in total for both players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. Given that I have three 0s in my hand and the bid is 3 1s, bidding 4 0s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and utilizes the information from my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze how many 0s are likely in the game. In my hand (11206168), I have one 0. Player 0 has bid 4 0s, which means they're claiming there are at least 4 zeros between our combined hands. Since I only have 1 zero, that means Player 0 would need to have at least 3 zeros in their hand for this bid to be valid. With 8 digits per player, it's certainly possible they have 3 or more zeros. The bid isn't particularly high or suspicious given the total possible digits. I could challenge, but it seems risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 1s and one 6 in my hand. I could bid 4 1s (same quantity, higher digit) or 5 0s (higher quantity). Since I'm not confident in the 1s, I'll go with a digit I know I have - the 6. I'll bid 4 6s, which is valid because it maintains the same quantity but uses a higher digit than 0.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 1. I have a hand of 43741950, which contains one 6 and four 0s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. Since my previous bid was 4 0s and I have a total of four 0s, I should consider if challenging or bidding higher is more strategic. The bid of 4 6s could be valid or not, but I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false.
