Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made and I have two 8s in my hand, I should start with a bid that is likely to be true but not too high. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that other players have at least one 8.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 8s. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 3 but raise the digit. Since I have one 3 and one 9, bidding 3 9s is a valid increase and plausible given the total digits. Bidding 4 0s or higher quantity is riskier without more evidence, so bidding 3 9s is a cautious and valid move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s, made by Player 1. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8, making 3 9s a plausible bid. Challenging is risky. I need to make a higher bid, which requires a quantity of at least 4. My hand contains two 4s. Bidding 4 4s is a valid higher bid (quantity 4 is greater than quantity 3) and is well-supported by my hand, as I only need two more 4s from the remaining 40 digits across 5 players. This is a more conservative and likely bid than needing 3 or 4 of other digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 5. With 6 players having 8 digits each (48 total), and Player 3 bidding 4 5s, this means there need to be at least 3 more 5s among the other players' hands. While possible, I can see the entire distribution of digits in my hand (39058376), and having only one 5 makes the claim of 4 total 5s somewhat risky. Since I have two 6s in my hand, I can make a safer bid of 4 6s, which is valid as it keeps the same quantity but increases the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s, which means there would need to be at least three more 6s among the other five players' hands. Given that the bid has already increased from 4 4s to 4 5s to 4 6s, it's possible that players are bidding based on their hands. However, with only one 6 in my hand, I'm skeptical that there are three more among the remaining players. I think it's unlikely, so I'll challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand, and as the first bidder in this round, I want to start conservatively. With 5 players having 8 digits each (40 total), bidding 3 3s is a safe opening move. It's likely there are at least two more 3s among the other 32 digits I can't see, and starting with a moderate digit value gives room for others to bid up.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have two 8s in my hand, and the highest bids so far have been on higher digits (6s, 5s, 4s, 9s, 8s). Bidding 4 7s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid, and it's plausible given the game history.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Since I must bid higher, the next valid bids are either 4 of a digit higher than 7 (i.e., 4 8s or 4 9s) or 5 of any digit. Given I have no 8s or 9s, bidding 4 8s or 4 9s is risky. Bidding 5 0s is a safer increase in quantity, as zeros might be more common overall. Challenging 4 7s might be premature since 7s could be present in other players' hands. Therefore, I will bid 5 0s to raise the quantity and keep the game going.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. There are 5 players remaining with 8 digits each, totaling 40 digits. The average expected count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. The bid of 5 0s is above this average. My hand contains zero 0s. For the bid to be true, there must be at least 5 0s among the other 4 players' 32 digits. The probability of this occurring is relatively low (approximately 18% based on binomial distribution B(32, 0.1)). Challenging this bid is statistically favorable given my hand and the low probability of the bid being true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: It is my turn to make the first bid of the round, as the current bid is 'None'. There are 3 players remaining, each with 8 digits, for a total of 24 digits. My hand is 72194634, which contains two 4s (my most frequent digit). The average count for any digit across 24 digits is 2.4. Bidding 3 4s is a reasonable opening bid based on having two 4s in my hand and expecting at least one more among the other 16 digits. This is a safe and plausible starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 4. With 24 total digits and 3 players, the bid of 3 4s seems reasonable. Given my hand has a 4, for the bid to be false, there would need to be less than 2 4s in the other 16 digits combined. That's unlikely. Since the bid seems safe, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 5, so bidding 3 5s is a logical progression that keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: There are 24 digits remaining across 3 players, with 8 digits each. The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Bidding 4 5s is risky as it's only one higher than the current bid, and there might not be enough 5s. However, challenging might be too risky as well, since there could easily be 3 5s. I have two 8s, so bidding 4 8s is a safer and higher bid, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s, made by Player 0. My hand contains zero 8s, making it difficult to support a higher bid on 8s. Challenging 4 8s is risky, as Player 0 likely holds some 8s to make such a bid plausible (expected 8s in 24 digits is 2.4). My hand contains two 4s. Bidding 5 4s is a valid higher bid (quantity 5 > quantity 4) and is based on a digit I have in my hand. While needing 3 additional 4s from the remaining 16 digits is somewhat aggressive (expected 1.6), it is a plausible bid. Furthermore, the history shows that the total count of 4s was 5 in the previous round (with 32 digits), and I was the bidder of 3 4s in that round. This might lead Player 4 (the next player) to believe I hold a significant number of 4s, potentially making them less likely to challenge my bid of 5 4s immediately.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (39058376), I have only one 4. For the bid of '5 4s' to be true, there would need to be 4 more 4s between the other two players (8 digits each). While possible, this seems unlikely given the previous bidding patterns and that Player 2 has already shown some aggressive bidding. Additionally, Player 2's jump from the previous bid of '4 8s' to '5 4s' seems desperate. Given my knowledge of having just one 4, and needing 4 more between just two players, I should challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: I'm starting this round with my hand of 39058376. With 16 total digits (8 per player), and seeing one 3 in my hand, bidding 2 3s is a safe opening move. It's conservative enough to be likely true (only need one more 3 from opponent's 8 digits) while leaving room for the bidding to progress.

Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. For the opponent's bid of '3 8s' to be true, they would need to have at least two 8s in their hand. While possible, this seems unlikely given that 8s aren't particularly common in the previous rounds' history. Also, I've seen the opponent make aggressive bids in previous rounds. With only 16 total digits in play and seeing only one 8 in my hand, the probability of there being two more 8s in the opponent's hand is relatively low. I should challenge.
