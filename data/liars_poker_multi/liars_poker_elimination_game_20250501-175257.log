Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Starting the bid at 4 9s, which aligns with the average expected count of ~4.8 per digit across all hands. This is a reasonable opening bid that leverages my holdings while considering statistical expectations.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 0's bid of '4 9s' or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (69285131), I don't have any 9s. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, so 48 total digits in play. For there to be at least 4 nines, the other 5 players would need to have at least 4 nines among their 40 digits. This is certainly possible, as the probability of a random digit being a 9 is 1/10, so we'd expect about 4 nines among 40 random digits. Since this is the first bid of the game and it's relatively conservative (only claiming 4 out of a possible 48 digits), challenging would be risky. I should make a higher bid. I have one 1 and two 3s in my hand, but I'll bid on 5s (5 5s) since it's a higher quantity than the current bid, making it harder to challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4.8.  A bid of 5 5s is slightly above average, but not unreasonable. However, I have a significant number of 0s (two) and 1s (two) in my hand. Bidding on a digit I have more of is generally a safer strategy. I can bid 6 0s, which is a higher quantity than the current bid and uses a digit I have multiple of.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. My hand contains no 0s, and with 48 total digits across all players, it's possible the actual count of 0s is less than 6. Challenging this bid is a reasonable risk given the lack of evidence for six 0s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Since I'm the first to bid in this round, I'll start with a moderate bid of 3 6s, increasing the quantity to account for potential additional 6s in other players' hands.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which seems plausible given that there are 40 digits in total and 5 players. Since I have one 6, it's possible that other players have at least two more 6s combined. To stay in the game, I should make a higher bid. Increasing the digit to 7s while keeping the quantity the same is a safe move, as 7s are less common and the bid remains reasonable.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since the quantity is 3, I can bid 3 8s or 4 0s or higher. I have one 9 in my hand, which supports bidding higher digits. Bidding 3 8s is a minimal increase and reasonable given the current bid and my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) based on my holdings, which makes it plausible there are at least three 9s in total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge Player 0's bid of '3 9s'. Looking at my hand (69285131), I have 0 nines. Since the current bid is for 3 nines total among all players, and I don't have any, that means the other 4 players would need to have at least 3 nines between them. This is certainly possible as each player has 8 digits, so the probability isn't low enough to justify a challenge. For my bid, I need to go higher than '3 9s'. I could bid '4 0s', '4 1s', '4 2s', etc. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, so bidding '4 1s' seems reasonable. I would need only 2 more 1s among the other 4 players (who have 32 digits total), which is quite likely.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains two 6s. The current bid is 4 1s. Bidding 4 6s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 6s and challenges the current low-digit bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s, which means Player 3 is claiming there are at least four 6s in total among all players. Given that there are 40 digits remaining and only five players left, it's possible but risky. Since I only have one 6, I'm not confident there are three more among the other four players. Challenging seems like the better option.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since 3 7s is the next valid higher bid, but I have no 7s, bidding 3 7s might be risky. Instead, I can bid 4 0s, which is a higher quantity and digit 0 is in my hand twice. This makes the bid reasonable and increases the pressure on others.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand. With 32 total digits remaining across 4 players (including me), the 4 0s bid would require all 4 zeros to be in the other 24 digits (Players 1, 3, and 5's hands). Assuming random distribution, the expected number of zeros in those 24 digits is 2.4 (10% probability per digit). The bid of 4 zeros exceeds this expectation and seems unlikely to be met, especially with no zeros in my hand. Challenging this bid carries a high probability of success.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Starting the round with a bid of 3 9s seems plausible as it's likely there's at least one more 9 among the remaining 16 digits in other players' hands. Bidding a high digit also pressures opponents to make higher quantity bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. Looking at my hand (69285131), I have zero 9s. The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 0. With 3 players having 8 digits each, there are 24 total digits in play. Player 0 is claiming there are at least 3 nines among all players. Since I have zero 9s, this means Player 0 and Player 3 would need to have at least 3 nines between them. This is certainly possible, but not guaranteed. I could make a higher bid, but I need to consider what digits I have multiples of. I have two 1s in my hand, which gives me some confidence to bid on 1s. I could bid '4 1s', claiming there are at least 4 ones total. Since I already have 2, I only need 2 more between the other players, which seems reasonable. Alternatively, I could challenge the current bid of 3 9s, but since it's a relatively low bid (only 3 out of 24 possible digits), it's quite risky to challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 1s. Bidding 4 6s is a valid higher bid since the digit 6 is higher than 1, maintaining the same quantity. This leverages my hand's composition while adhering to the rules.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, but Player 3's consistent bidding on 6s suggests they likely hold multiple 6s. With 24 total digits remaining and Player 3's aggressive bid of 4 6s, the combined count of 6s across all players could plausibly meet or exceed 4. Challenging risks elimination if the bid is valid. Instead, leveraging my two 9s, I can make a competitive bid of '4 9s'—same quantity but a higher digit than 6s—to shift focus to a digit I have a stronger holding in.

Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (69285131), I have zero 9s. Player 0 has bid 4 9s, meaning they're claiming there are at least 4 nines among all 24 digits. Since I have none, all 4 would need to be between Player 0 and Player 3 (each with 8 digits). This is possible but somewhat unlikely. Player 0 also previously bid 3 9s earlier in this round, suggesting they might have at least 1-2 nines. I could challenge, but it's risky. Alternatively, I could bid 5 of something. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding 5 1s seems reasonable - I know I have 2, so I only need 3 more between the other two players, which is plausible. I'll make this bid rather than risking a challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid of 5 6s requires at least five 6s in total. I have one 6 in my hand, leaving four to be distributed between Player 1 and Player 3. Historically, after eliminating Player 4 (who may have had few or no 6s), the remaining total is uncertain. Given the expected uniform distribution of digits and the risk of overestimating, challenging seems justified. Player 3's previous successful bid of 4 6s (actual count 5) occurred in a round with an additional player, which may have skewed the total. With limited information, the bid feels high for the current three-player round.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Starting the round, a bid of 3 9s is plausible if Player 1 holds at least one 9.

Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. We have 2 players left, each with 8 digits, for a total of 16 digits in play. The current bid is '3 9s', claiming there are at least 3 nines between both players. Looking at my hand (69285131), I have 0 nines. This means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 3 nines in their hand alone. While possible, this seems somewhat unlikely as it would mean over 1/3 of their hand consists of nines. Given my hand has two 1s, I could reasonably bid '4 1s', suggesting there are at least 2 more 1s in Player 0's hand. However, since I'm uncertain about the distribution of Player 0's digits and they've shown confidence in bidding 3 9s, I think challenging is the safer option here.
