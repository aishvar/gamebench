Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning I can make any initial bid. I have 8 digits in my hand: 6, 8, 3, 8, 0, 1, 4, 1. I see two 8s and two 1s. A reasonable initial bid could be based on the digit 8 since it appears twice in my hand. Given that there are 6 players and each has 8 digits, a bid of '2 8s' seems conservative and likely to be true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 8s', made by Player 0. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 4.8. A bid of two 8s is therefore very likely to be true, making a challenge extremely risky at this early stage. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 92015160, containing two 0s and two 1s. Bidding based on these digits is strong. A bid of '3 0s' or '3 1s' is statistically very safe, as I hold two of the required digit, and the expected total count across all hands is close to 5. I will bid '3 1s', which is higher than '2 8s' (higher quantity) and is well-supported by my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 84473065. I have zero 1s. The current bid is 3 1s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8. A bid of 3 1s is below average, but I have no information about other players' hands. Given I have no 1s, and the bid is already 3, increasing the bid on 1s feels risky. I have two 4s, one 8, one 7, one 3, one 0, one 6, and one 5. I can make a bid based on my hand that is higher than 3 1s. Bidding 3 4s is a valid higher bid and I have two 4s myself, making it a reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand of 91599015, I have zero 4s. The current bid of '3 4s' means Player 2 thinks there are at least 3 fours among all 48 digits. While this isn't an unreasonable bid (it only requires 3 fours across 6 players), I have none in my hand, which makes it less likely. However, challenging now might be premature since it's a relatively low bid. Instead, I can safely bid '3 5s' since I have two 5s in my own hand, making it a conservative and safe play that advances the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '3 5s'. Looking at my hand (16073478), I don't have any 5s, which means all 5s must be in other players' hands. With 5 other players having 8 digits each (40 digits total), it's quite reasonable that there are at least 3 fives among them. I could safely bid '3 6s' since I have a 7 in my hand, or increase the quantity to '4' of a lower digit. Since I have a 1, a 6, and a 7 in my hand, I'll bid '3 6s' to make a slightly higher bid while staying conservative.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 6s' and my hand '74728270', I notice I have no 6s. However, considering the bidding history and the fact that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48, making a significantly higher bid might be risky. Since I don't have any 6s and the bid is already at '3 6s', I should consider challenging this bid as it seems unlikely that there are at least three 6s among all players, especially given the random distribution of digits. Challenging seems like a safer option than trying to make a higher bid without sufficient information or having relevant digits in my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding in this round. Looking at my hand (16073478), I have one 1, one 6, one 0, one 7, one 3, one 4, one 7, and one 8. Since I have one 7, I could start with a bid of '2 7s', expecting there to be at least one more 7 among the other 32 digits held by other players. This is a conservative opening bid that has a good chance of being true while still establishing a reasonable starting point. Alternatively, I could bid on 1s, 4s, or 8s which I also have in my hand, but 7 is a higher digit which might be strategically advantageous as an opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s made by Player 4. I have 8 secret digits: 6, 8, 3, 8, 0, 1, 4, 1. I see that I have two 8s and one 1, but no 7s. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are 40 digits in total. The bid of 2 7s seems low and potentially vulnerable to challenge, but I also have the opportunity to make a higher bid. Since I don't have any 7s, I will consider bidding on a digit that I have. Bidding 2 8s seems reasonable as it's higher than 2 7s and I have two 8s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand (92015160). With 5 players and 8 digits each (40 total digits), the expected average count for any digit is 4. A bid of 3 8s is below the average and plausible, making a challenge risky at this early stage. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 3 9s or any bid with quantity 4 or more. I have two 0s and two 1s. Bidding 4 0s or 4 1s is well-supported by my hand, as it only requires two more 0s or 1s among the remaining 32 digits held by other players. This aligns perfectly with the expected average count of 4. Bidding 4 1s seems like a strong, safe move. It increases the quantity and is based on the strong presence of 1s in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have zero 1s in my hand. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4. A bid of 4 1s is exactly the average, so it's not inherently unlikely, but since I have none, it makes it slightly less probable. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s. A bid of 5 4s would be a reasonable increase over 4 1s and is supported by my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand of 91599015, I have zero 4s. The current bid is 5 4s. With 5 players having 8 digits each (40 total), and knowing I have none, there would need to be 5 4s among the other 32 digits (4 players Ã— 8 digits). While possible, this seems unlikely given the bidding pattern and that Player 2 jumped to 5 4s from 4 1s. The probability of having 5 or more 4s in the remaining 32 digits when I have zero is low enough to warrant a challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have my hand of 91599015 which contains: two 9s, two 5s, two 1s, one 0. Since I'm starting the bidding in this round and I have two 5s, making a conservative bid of 3 5s would be reasonable. This allows room for at least one more 5 among other players' 24 digits, which is quite likely. It's also a good middle-range digit that leaves room for others to bid up or down.

Player 4 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (16073478), I have zero 5s. Player 3 has bid 3 5s, meaning they believe there are at least 3 fives among all 32 digits. Since I don't have any 5s, all 3+ would need to come from the other three players. This is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's a relatively low and reasonable bid at this stage of the game. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have one 6 and one 7 in my hand, so I could bid 3 6s (same quantity, higher digit) or even 3 7s. Since I have one 7 in my hand, bidding 3 7s seems reasonable - I only need 2 more 7s among the other 24 digits held by other players.

I see that bidding 4 8s would be a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity and I have two 8s in my hand, which could reasonably exist in other players' hands as well.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand (92015160). This means the other 3 players (24 digits) must have at least four 8s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 8s in those 24 digits is 2.4 (24/10). While Player 0 has consistently bid on 8s (2 8s, 3 8s, now 4 8s), requiring 4 from the other 24 digits when I have none makes the bid somewhat suspect. However, I have two 1s and two 0s. I previously bid 3 1s and 4 1s in past rounds. Bidding 5 1s is a natural progression based on my hand (two 1s) and my history. It requires three more 1s from the remaining 24 digits, which is plausible (expected 2.4). This increases the quantity and puts pressure on the next player, seeming safer than challenging Player 0's potentially strong 8s or making a less supported bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 1s (91599015). The current bid of '5 1s' means there need to be at least 5 ones total among all 32 digits. With only 2 ones in my hand, there would need to be at least 3 more ones among the other 24 digits held by other players. While possible, this seems unlikely given the aggressive bidding pattern. Additionally, Player 1's jump from the previous bid of '4 8s' to '5 1s' seems suspicious. Given my knowledge of my own hand having only 2 ones, I should challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: I am Player 1 and it's my turn to make the opening bid. The current bid is 'None'. I have 8 digits: 92015160. I hold two 0s and two 1s, which are my most frequent digits. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the expected average count for any digit is 2.4. An opening bid of '2 0s' is strongly supported by my hand (holding two 0s) and is statistically very likely to be true (expecting 2.4 zeros on average across all 24 digits).

Looking at my hand, I have a 7, which I could use to make a higher bid. I could bid '2 7s' since I have one 7 in my hand, and there's a reasonable chance of finding at least one more 7 among the other 16 digits held by other players. I could also increase the quantity to 3 of something I have, like '3 1s' or '3 7s', but that's riskier. I'll go with a safer bid of '2 7s'.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 0. I have two 0s and two 1s in my hand (92015160), and zero 8s. There are 24 total digits. Challenging 3 8s means Player 0 and Player 4 need three or more 8s between their 16 digits for me to lose; this is plausible, making a challenge risky. I can make a higher bid. Bidding 3 9s is possible (I have one 9). Bidding 4 0s is strong as I hold two 0s, requiring only two more from the other 16 digits (statistically likely, expected count is 2.4 total). Bidding 4 1s is similarly strong (I hold two 1s). Since I opened this round bidding 2 0s, bidding 4 0s is a consistent and strong move based on my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand (the third digit). The current bid is 4 0s, which means Player 1 is claiming there are at least 4 zeros among all players' hands. Since I have 1 zero, that means there would need to be at least 3 more zeros between Player 0 and Player 1. Player 1 has bid on zeros twice this round, first claiming 2 zeros and now 4 zeros, which suggests they likely have some zeros. However, I need to decide if I believe there are 4 or more zeros total. Looking at my options: I could bid 5 0s (increasing quantity), 4 1s (same quantity, higher digit), or challenge. Since I have only 1 zero, bidding 5 0s seems risky. I have a 1 in my hand, so 4 1s is possible. Given that Player 1 seems confident about zeros, I'll make a safer bid by increasing the digit rather than the quantity.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s made by Player 4. I have one 1 in my hand. Given that there are only 24 digits in total and three players, it seems unlikely that there are at least 4 1s. However, I need to consider my own hand and the bidding history. Since my goal is to either make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should assess if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more strategic. I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 5 2s seems reasonable if I consider my hand (68380141) and the need to have a higher quantity or digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s made by Player 0. I hold one '2' in my hand (92015160). For the bid to be accurate, there must be at least four more '2's distributed among the remaining 16 digits held by Player 0 and Player 4. The expected number of '2's in those 16 digits is 1.6 (16 * 0.1). Requiring four or more '2's is statistically unlikely. My best alternative bid would likely be 6 0s or 6 1s (since I hold two of each), which would require four 0s or four 1s among the other 16 digits - a similarly unlikely scenario. Given the relatively high quantity bid (5) compared to the expected average (2.4) and my specific hand (only one 2), challenging Player 0's bid appears to be the most statistically sound move.

Player 4 Reasoning: I need to assess the current situation. I have 8 digits in my hand (16073478) which contains one 0. Player 1 has bid '2 0s', meaning they believe there are at least 2 zeros in total between both our hands.

Instead, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 7, and one 8. I could bid '2 1s' (same quantity, higher digit), but I only have one 1 so Player 1 would only need one 1 for this to be valid. I have one 7, so bidding '2 7s' would be similarly risky. A safer option might be to increase the quantity to 3, focusing on a digit I don't have much of, like '3 2s' or '3 5s', forcing Player 1 to have multiple of these digits. Since I have zero 5s in my hand, bidding '3 5s' would mean Player 1 needs to have all 3, which is less likely. I'll go with this more aggressive bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 4. I have one 5 in my hand (92015160). For the bid to be accurate, Player 4 must have at least two 5s among their 8 digits. The total number of digits is 16. The probability of Player 4 having exactly two 5s is approximately 14.9%, and the probability of them having three or more is even lower (approx 3.3% + 0.5% + ...). The total probability of Player 4 having two or more 5s is less than 20%. Therefore, there is a high probability (over 80%) that the actual total count of 5s is less than 3. Challenging the bid is statistically the strongest move.
