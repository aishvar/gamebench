Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 90619559, which has two 9s, two 5s, and one each of 0, 1, and 6. Bidding on 9s seems promising as I already have two, and with 48 total digits across 6 players, it's plausible that there are more 9s out there. I'll bid 3 9s to start conservatively, which is a reasonable estimate and allows room for others to bid higher.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. To outbid 3 9s I must raise the quantity. Bidding 4 9s is reasonable: with my two plus an expected ~2.8 more 9s in the 40 other cards, there’s over a 90% chance of at least four total 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 9s and considering the total number of digits remaining is 48, it seems reasonable to increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains 13836513, I have a good number of low to mid-range digits but no 9s. Increasing the digit seems like a safer bet than increasing the quantity significantly, as the total count of any digit above 4 is uncertain and risky. Bidding on a lower digit with a higher quantity than 4 might be safer, considering the distribution of my hand and the potential distribution in others. However, without specific information on other players' hands, the safest increase considering my hand and the goal to make a valid higher bid would be to maintain a reasonable quantity and increase the digit, which is not directly possible from 4 9s without risking a very high digit or an unlikely high quantity. Given the constraints and aiming for a strategic move, challenging seems less favorable without strong evidence against the current bid's feasibility. Hence, considering the necessity to bid higher and the composition of my hand, a strategic move could involve increasing the quantity of a digit that is somewhat represented in my hand or aiming for a digit that might have a higher occurrence rate across all players. Since my hand does not provide a clear advantage in bidding on a specific higher digit directly, and given the need to exceed the current bid of 4 9s, a reasonable strategy involves considering what could be a plausible next step that does not overly rely on the specifics of my hand but rather on the game's dynamics and the information provided by the bids so far.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. Given that there are 6 players with 8 digits each (48 total digits), the probability of having 5 or more 8s is relatively low, but not impossible. However, increasing the quantity to 6 8s seems highly improbable. I will challenge the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an opening bid. Looking at my hand, 13836513, I notice I have two 1s, two 3s, two 5s, and one 6 and one 8. Since the goal is to make a bid that is reasonable yet challenging for others to surpass, I should consider the digits I have in abundance. With two 1s and knowing that each player has 8 digits, it's possible that 1s could be relatively common. However, to make a safe initial bid, I should choose a digit that I have at least one of, to increase the chances of its presence in other players' hands. Given that I have two 1s and considering the total number of digits remaining is 40, bidding on a digit I have multiple of seems like a good strategy. Bidding on 1s could be a good starting point because it's a low digit, making it easier for me to potentially increase the bid later if needed, or challenge if someone bids too high.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have no 1s in my hand, but I have a 4, a 3, a 8, a 5, and a 6. Considering the bid is relatively low, I'll try to bid on a digit that I have more of. I have two 5s and one 6, but bidding 2 6s would be a weak move. Bidding 3 5s seems reasonable, as I have two 5s and it's a higher quantity than the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s, and I have the digits 0, 2, 8, 0, 9, 7, 1, 8 in my hand. Counting the 5s, I have zero 5s. Bidding 5 5s would be risky, as the actual count is likely less than 4, and increasing the digit to 6 or higher is unlikely to be supported by my hand. Challenging the current bid seems prudent because the total number of 5s in the game is probably less than 4, making the current bid suspiciously high. Challenging is the safer move here.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 90619559, which contains three 5s. The current bid by Player 4 is 8 5s out of a total of 32 digits across 4 players. Given that I have three 5s, there need to be at least five more 5s among the other 24 digits to meet the bid. The probability of this is relatively low, as it would mean over 20% of the remaining digits are 5s. While it's possible, I believe the bid is on the higher side, and challenging could be a strategic move to potentially eliminate a player or confirm the distribution. However, since I have a significant portion of 5s myself, I’ll make a higher bid instead to push the game forward and test the waters. I’ll bid 9 5s to slightly increase the quantity while staying on the same digit, as I have confidence in at least some 5s being out there.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 9 5s, meaning at least 9 fives among 32 digits. That requires at least 8 fives in the 24 unknown digits. The probability of 8 or more fives in 24 digits is under 0.2%, making this bid extremely unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. With 16 unknown digits, there’s an expected ~1.6 additional 9s, giving a high probability (over 80%) that at least one more exists. Bidding 3 9s is safe and, since 9 is the highest digit, it prevents any same-quantity overbids, forcing opponents to jump to 4 of a kind.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 9s and my hand of 13836513, which contains no 9s, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least three 9s among the 24 total digits. Since each player has 8 digits, and there are 3 active players, it's possible but not highly probable that three 9s exist. However, without more information about the other players' hands, making a bid that is strictly higher than 3 9s seems risky. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 24, and I have to make a bid that is higher in either quantity or digit, bidding on a digit I have more information on or challenging the current bid are my options. Given my hand and the fact that I don't have any 9s, challenging seems like a safer option because if the bid is unlikely, I could win by challenging. On the other hand, making a bid on a digit I have, like 1, 3, 5, 6, or 8, could be strategic but must be done carefully to ensure it's plausible and higher than the current bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. I have the hand 13836513, which contains two 1s, two 3s, two 5s, and two 6s. Since I have two 1s and the total number of digits remaining is 16, it's reasonable to start with a low quantity and a low digit to minimize risk. Bidding 2 1s seems like a safe and reasonable starting point, as it's likely that there could be at least two 1s between the two players.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s, and I have one 1 in my hand. Since I have a 1, I should bid a higher quantity or digit. I have no 2s or higher quantities of 1s, but I have a 3 and a 1, so I can bid 3 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 1s' by Player 4 and considering my hand '13836513', I notice I have two 1s. Since there are only 16 digits in total and I have 8 of them, Player 4 must also have 8 digits. The presence of two 1s in my hand suggests that bidding higher on the quantity of 1s might be risky without knowing Player 4's hand. However, I also see that I can increase the digit value while keeping the quantity the same as the current bid or increase the quantity. Considering the distribution of my hand and the fact that I have multiple occurrences of digits other than 1, I could consider bidding on a different digit. Given my hand has two 6s and a 5 and a 3, and considering the bids made in previous rounds, it seems plausible that there could be a significant number of higher digits. Yet, without clear evidence of their distribution in Player 4's hand, any bid on higher digits involves risk. Given these considerations and the need to make a strictly higher bid, challenging the current bid seems like a viable option, especially since the bid of '3 1s' might be within the realm of possibility given my own two 1s and the potential for Player 4 to have at least one 1. However, the safer approach, considering the information at hand and the potential risks, would be to make a bid that is reasonably informed by my hand and the game's history.

Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 1s and my hand containing two 1s, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least 5 ones in total across both players' hands. Since each player has 8 digits and there are only 16 digits in total, the maximum number of any digit is 16. With my two 1s, if I bid higher, I need to consider if it's plausible for the total to reach or exceed that number. Given that I have two 1s and the bid is already at 5 1s, bidding higher in quantity seems risky without more information about Player 4's hand. However, I also note that the digit '1' is relatively low, and there's room to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same or slightly increasing it. A safer approach might be to increase the digit, considering the distribution of digits in my hand and the fact that we are down to the last two players, making each digit's distribution more critical. Since my hand contains a 3 and other higher digits, and given the current state of the game, a strategic move could be to increase the digit, aiming for a number that is plausible given the remaining digits and the history of bids and challenges.

Since I have two 3s, this means there must be at least four more 3s in Player 4's hand to meet the bid, which seems unlikely given the distribution of digits. However, I must also consider the possibility that Player 4 has made an informed bid based on their own hand. Given that I can bid higher either by increasing the quantity or the digit, and considering the constraints of the game, I should challenge this bid as it seems unlikely that there are six 3s in total, especially with the limited number of digits remaining.
