Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With 48 total digits, the expected number of any digit is about 4.8. Bidding 5 sixes is plausible, and since I hold 2, I only need 3 more among 40 other digits, which has roughly a 78% chance. Starting with 5 sixes is a strong opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Given that there are 48 digits remaining across 6 players, it is plausible that there could be at least 6 6s in total. Bidding 6 6s is a reasonable increase in quantity while keeping the same digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 and one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 6 6s. Bidding 6 7s is a valid higher bid since it maintains the same quantity but increases the digit. This leverages my possession of a 7 and pressures others to respond.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s made by Player 3. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than this. I have two 6s and one 8 in my hand. Since the bid must be higher than 6 8s, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity seems risky without knowing the distribution of 8s among other players. However, I can increase the digit and bid on 9s. There is one 9 in my hand. Bidding 1 9s is a valid higher bid because it's the same quantity but a higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Given that there are 6 players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 48 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. Bidding a higher quantity or digit requires careful consideration. I can see that bidding 7 0s would be a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity. However, I should also consider the likelihood of the current bid being true or false. Given my hand and the total digits available, challenging seems risky without strong evidence the bid is false. I will bid 7 0s as it is a strictly higher bid quantity than 6 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 8 0s is a reasonable increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 2. However, given the history of bids increasing in quantity, and the fact that 7 0s is already a fairly high bid, increasing the quantity of 0s seems like the most logical and safe move. Bidding on another digit would be riskier without knowing what others have.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I only have one zero in my hand, so for 8 zeros to be present the other 40 cards must contain at least 7 zeros. With an expected 4 zeros and only about an 11% chance of seeing 7+ in those cards, the bid is highly unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand and with 32 unseen cards the expected count of 6s in the other players’ hands is about 3.2, giving a total around 5.2. Starting with a bid of 5 sixes is just below that expectation and makes a solid opening move based on my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Given that there are 40 digits remaining and 5 players, it's plausible that there could be at least 6 6s in total. Bidding 6 6s is a safe and strategic move, as it matches the previous high bid of 6 [any digit] while maintaining the same digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s made by Player 3. I have 2 zeros in my hand. Given that there are 3 other active players, the total count of 0s could reasonably be higher than 1. I will bid 2 0s to increase the quantity based on my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 2 0s. By bidding 2 6s (same quantity, higher digit) I leverage my two 6s—if challenged I automatically win since I hold exactly two 6s. This minimal raise also pressures opponents to bid digits they may not hold.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Given the bidding history, it's reasonable to assume that there are more 6s in other players' hands. Bidding 3 6s is a logical next step, increasing the quantity based on my hand and the previous bids. Challenging seems risky as there could easily be 2 6s among the other players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s made by Player 3. I have 2 sevens in my hand. Given that there are 4 active players and each has 8 secret digits, there are 32 digits in total. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. I should calculate the likelihood of there being at least 3 7s. If I assume the worst-case scenario for 7s distribution, it's possible but not guaranteed. However, I can make a higher bid with a digit that has a higher chance of existing or challenge if I think it's unlikely. My hand contains 2 sevens, so bidding higher seems feasible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 7s in my hand. The remaining 24 digits have an expected 2.4 sevens (σ≈1.47), so the probability of at least 4 sevens is only about 23%. A bid of 4 7s is therefore unlikely, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my turn as Player 4. I have 8 secret digits: 22577442. I see opportunities to bid based on my hand. I have two 7s and two 0s. Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. Bidding '2 7s' seems reasonable as it's based on my own hand and not excessively high given the total digits remaining.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have two 9s in my hand. Given the previous bids and challenges, it seems reasonable to bid on a higher digit. Bidding 3 9s increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a strong bid. Challenging seems risky because 2 7s is a low bid and could easily be true.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is '4 0s' made by Player 3. I have two 7s and one 0 in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and there are 24 total digits remaining, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems feasible. Since I need to bid higher than '4 0s', I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 7s, and considering the total digits and previous bids, bidding '5 0s' seems reasonable but I should also consider the likelihood of higher digits being more scarce. Alternatively, I could bid '4 1s' or higher digit with a lower quantity, but given my hand, bidding '4 7s' seems like a strong move as it increases the digit and I have two 7s.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Player 3 previously bid 4 0s. Bidding 5 9s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand. The current bid '4 7s' is likely to be true, so challenging is not a good idea. I have no 7s, and the previous bid of '3 9s' suggests there are at least three 9s among all players, making it plausible that there are four 7s among all players. Also, there are 24 digits left, and it's possible that there are four 7s among the remaining digits.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits: 22577442. I count 2 zeros in my hand. Given that there are 24 total digits remaining across 3 players, and assuming the other players have a reasonable distribution, bidding a high quantity of a less likely digit or increasing the quantity of a digit that could reasonably exist seems strategic. However, I should consider the likelihood of 0s being distributed. With 2 zeros in my hand and 16 digits remaining for other players, the bid of 6 0s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more beneficial.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. Given that there are 24 digits remaining across 3 players, a bid of 7 1s seems plausible. However, I need to make a higher bid. I have two 9s, and previously, a bid of 5 9s was made. Increasing this to 8 9s seems reasonable, as it's unlikely that any player has more than two 9s, making it a safe bid. Challenging 7 1s could be risky since I have two 1s myself.

If I challenge and lose, I'll be eliminated. I should calculate the risk and potential. My hand contains 2 zeros, so the bid of 9 0s could be plausible but I need to verify if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more beneficial.
