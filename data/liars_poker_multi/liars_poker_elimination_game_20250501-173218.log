Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round. My hand is 89179874. I have two 8s, two 9s, two 7s, one 1, and one 4. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. A bid of 3 8s or 3 9s seems reasonable based on my hand and the number of players, as it's slightly above the expected average (40 total digits / 10 possible digits = 4 per digit on average). Bidding 3 8s is a good starting bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 8s in my hand, meaning the actual count of 8s is at least two. Since the bid requires at least three 8s, there's a possibility the bid is false. Challenging this bid could expose the lie, especially since the minimum possible count (based on my hand) is two, which is less than the bid. This makes a challenge a strategic risk with potential reward.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round and the current bid is None. I have two 8s, two 9s, two 7s, one 1, and one 4 in my hand. With 32 total digits across 4 players, an average distribution would be 3.2 of each digit. Bidding 3 8s is a safe starting bid based on my hand and the total number of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 9, which means Player 3's bid of '3 9s' requires at least two more 9s among the other three players (24 digits). While possible, this seems somewhat unlikely. Given that Player 3 raised from 3 8s to 3 9s rather than increasing the quantity, they might be bluffing. Additionally, Player 1's earlier successful bid of '3 8s' in the previous round doesn't necessarily mean they still have many 8s in this new round. With only one 9 in my hand and the relatively high digit being bid, challenging seems like the safer option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is '1 0s' made by Player 3. I have two 0s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and there are only 3 active players with 8 digits each, bidding a higher quantity seems reasonable. I will bid '2 0s' as it is a straightforward increase in quantity based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:2 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 89179874. I have zero 0s. The current bid is 2 0s. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the average count of any digit is 2.4.  Since I have zero 0s, the other two players would need to have a combined total of at least two 0s for the bid to be true. This is plausible, but not certain.  I need to make a higher bid. I have two 8s, two 9s, two 7s, and one 1 and one 4. Bidding on 0s is risky since I have none. Bidding on a digit I have multiple of is safer. I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s is a reasonable increase from 2 0s, as it increases both the quantity and the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 3. I have the hand 03227011, which contains one 9. Given that there are two other active players (Player 1 and Player 3), and each player has 8 digits, the total number of digits across all players is 24. The bid of 3 9s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. My hand has one 9, and I don't know the exact distribution of digits in the other players' hands. However, bidding a higher quantity or digit is required. I can see that Player 1 previously bid 3 8s, so they might have some 8s or lower digits. Since my hand has two 0s, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 7, I should consider bidding on a digit that is more likely to have a higher count. Given that 3 9s is the current bid, I can try to bid higher on a digit that I have or seems likely.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits: 03227011. I see that I have no 9s in my hand. Given that there are 3 active players and 8 digits per player, there are 24 digits in total. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. I should consider the likelihood of there being at least 3 9s across all players' hands. Since I have no 9s, I need to assess if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is None, and it's my turn as Player 5. I have 8 secret digits: 03227011. I see that I have two 0s, and I can start with a conservative bid. Since there are no bids yet, I can make any valid bid. Bidding 2 0s seems reasonable based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. My hand is 89179874. I have zero 0s. Player 5 bid 2 0s. With only two players and 16 total digits, the probability of having two 0s is not extremely high, but it's not impossible. However, I have two 8s and two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s or 3 9s is a strong move based on my hand and is a valid higher bid than 2 0s. Bidding 3 8s seems like a solid next step.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 1. I have the hand 03227011, which contains two 0s and one 8. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, I should consider the likelihood of there being at least 3 8s. Since I only have one 8 and no information on Player 1's hand, I must assess if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. Bidding 4 0s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 89179874. I have two 8s, two 9s, two 7s, one 1, and one 4. The current bid is 4 0s. I have zero 0s. Bidding 5 0s seems too risky as I have none and there are only 16 total digits. Bidding 4 of a higher digit is possible. I have two 8s and two 9s. Bidding 4 8s or 4 9s are both valid and plausible given my hand. Bidding 4 8s is a slightly lower risk than 4 9s as 8s were previously shown to be somewhat common (actual count of 5 in a previous round with 48 digits). Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable increment over 4 0s and aligns with my hand.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 1. I have two 0s in my hand and previously bid 4 0s, which is a higher quantity of a lower digit. Since the total number of digits remaining is 16 and there are only 2 active players, I should assess the likelihood of there being at least 4 8s. Given that I have no 8s in my hand and only 8 digits in total for both players, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding 5 0s would be a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity.

Player 5 bids: 5 0s

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:2 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 89179874. I have two 8s, two 9s, two 7s, one 1, and one 4. The current bid is 5 0s. I have zero 0s. The total number of digits is 16. A bid of 5 0s means Player 5 believes there are at least 5 zeros between our hands. This seems high given the average expected number of any digit is around 1.6 (16 total digits / 10 possible digits).  However, challenging 5 0s is risky as Player 5 might actually have several 0s. Bidding higher is an option. I have two 8s, and my previous bids in this round were 3 8s and 4 8s.  Bidding 5 8s would be the next logical step based on my hand and previous bids, and it's a valid higher bid than 5 0s (same quantity, higher digit). Given I have two 8s and Player 5 might have some, 5 8s is a plausible bid, more so than challenging 5 0s when I have no information about Player 5's hand.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s made by Player 1. I have already bid 5 0s. To make a valid higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 0s and one 1, and no 9s, bidding a higher quantity of 0s or switching to a higher digit like 1 seems reasonable. However, I should also consider the likelihood of Player 1's bid being true. Given that there are 16 digits in total and Player 1 bid 5 8s, if I assume Player 1 has some 8s, it might be possible for them to have at least 5 8s. But I have only 1 8 in my hand, so challenging seems risky without more information. I will increase the quantity of 0s as it seems more certain.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 89179874. I have two 8s, two 9s, two 7s, one 1, and one 4. The current bid is 6 0s. With 16 total digits, the expected count of any single digit is around 1.6 (16 / 10). A bid of 6 of any digit is quite high. Player 5 has been consistently bidding on 0s. Given the low probability of 6 0s existing among 16 digits, and my lack of 0s, challenging seems like a strong move.
