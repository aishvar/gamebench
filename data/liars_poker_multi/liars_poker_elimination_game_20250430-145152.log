Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the round. I have one 1, one 2, one 4, two 6s, one 5, one 7, and one 8 in my hand. Starting with a low bid is generally a good strategy to gauge the other players. I'll bid 1 1s, which is a reasonable starting point given my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 1 1s. Bidding 2 8s increases the quantity and uses a digit I possess, making it a logical and higher bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. I could bid higher, but I'm not confident about the total number of 8s. I'll bid a slightly higher amount on a digit I have more of. I have two 3s. I will bid 3 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand of 04764414, I have two 4s but zero 3s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. The current bid of '3 3s' means Player 2 thinks there are at least 3 threes among all players. Given I have none, and the bid is still relatively low (3 out of a possible 48), it's reasonable to assume other players might have some 3s. Based on my hand having two 4s, I can make a safe bid of '3 4s', which is valid as it keeps the same quantity but increases the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s, meaning there must be at least three 4s across all players' hands. Given that there are five other players, it's plausible that two of them have a 4 each, making the bid valid. However, I don't have strong evidence to challenge. I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 5, which I have two of in my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a safe move.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 15878394, which contains one 5. The current bid is 3 5s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits in play, so it is plausible that there are at least 3 of any digit. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the digit or the quantity. I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding 3 8s is safe and keeps the quantity the same while increasing the digit, which is a valid move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. While it's possible other players do, bidding higher seems risky. I could bid 4 8s, but that's unlikely to be true. I could try a different digit, but given the previous bids are increasing, it suggests players *are* finding some of these digits. Bidding 4 1s is possible, but it doesn't capitalize on any information. Given my hand and the history, challenging seems like the best option. The previous bids have been relatively low, so 3 8s isn't outrageously high, but without any 8s myself, it feels like a good challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: As the first bidder this round, I should make an opening bid. My hand is 15878394, which contains two 8s and one of each of the other digits. Since 8s are strong in my hand and were also a successful bid in the last round, I will start with a conservative but credible bid of 2 8s.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, which matches the minimum possible count (since I already have two 8s). Bidding 3 8s increases the quantity, making it a valid higher bid based on my hand's composition.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Since the total digits remaining are 40, it is possible that there are at least 4 eights in total. I don't want to challenge and risk being wrong. I can bid 4 0s, which is a safe increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand of 04764414, I have one 0. The current bid of 4 0s means there need to be at least 3 more 0s among the other 32 digits held by other players. While possible, this seems unlikely given that 0s haven't been mentioned in previous rounds and I can only see one 0. I have strong information about my own hand, and the probability of finding 3 more 0s in 32 remaining digits is relatively low. A challenge here would be a calculated risk with good odds.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 3s, one 1, one 4, one 6, one 7, and one 8. Since there are no bids yet, I should start with a conservative bid. I'll bid 1 3s since I know I have at least one.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 9s and two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 1 3s, which is very low. Since I have two 5s, I can safely bid 2 5s, increasing both the quantity and the digit from the current bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand (15878394). The current bid is 2 5s, which is reasonable since there are 32 digits in play and it's likely that at least two 5s exist among all hands. Since I must either challenge or make a higher bid, and challenging this early is risky, I will make a minimal higher bid. I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding 2 8s is safe and strictly higher than 2 5s.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 5s and one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s. Since I have two 5s, it's reasonable to assume there might be at least one more 5 in the other players' hands, making a bid of 3 5s plausible. This bid increases the digit from 3 to 5 while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 15878394, which contains two 8s and one 5. The current bid is 3 5s. I only have one 5, so there must be at least two more 5s among the remaining 24 digits. This is plausible, but not certain. However, I have two 8s, and 8s have been bid successfully in previous rounds, suggesting there may be more in play. I can safely raise to 3 8s, matching the quantity and increasing the digit, which is a valid and relatively safe bid based on my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 8s and two 9s. The current bid is 3 8s. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid since the digit (9) is higher than 8, and I have sufficient 9s to support this claim. This maintains pressure without overcommitting.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 3 in my hand. I could bid 4 0s, but that seems weak. I could also bid 4 1s, 4 2s, etc. Since I have one 3, I will bid 4 0s to increase the quantity. I don't want to bid a higher digit because I don't have any.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand (from 90059568). The current bid is 4 0s. Given that there are 32 digits in total and only four players left, a bid of 4 0s seems plausible but risky. Since I have two 0s, it's possible there are at least two more among the other players. However, challenging now could be risky as well. A safer move would be to increase the bid slightly by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have three 5s in my hand, so bidding 4 5s is a reasonable next step.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 15878394, which contains one 5 and two 8s. The current bid is 4 5s. With only one 5 in my hand, there would need to be at least three more 5s among the remaining 24 digits (held by three other players). Statistically, this is plausible but not guaranteed. However, I have two 8s, and 8s have been bid up to 3 in previous rounds without being challenged. Bidding 4 8s increases the quantity and switches to a digit I have strong representation of. This is a safe and valid higher bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s. To bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. I could bid 5 0s, or 4 of a digit greater than 9, which is not possible. Alternatively, I could bid 5 of any digit. Given that I don't know the distribution of the other players' hands, and there are 32 total digits, bidding 5 of any digit seems somewhat risky. However, I have three 3s in my hand, so I will bid 5 3s. This is a raise on the quantity, and might be believable given my hand.

I can bid 2 9s, since I have one 9 and 9s have been bid frequently, but a more aggressive move is to bid 3 7s, since I have two 7s, making it plausible.

With only three players left (24 digits total), for the bid to be valid, there must be at least three 9s among all hands. Given that I have only one 9, there would need to be at least two more 9s among the other two players' 16 digits. Since 9 is a high digit and previous rounds have shown that high quantity bids for specific digits are often challenged successfully, it is unlikely that there are three or more 9s in total.

To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or the digit. Raising the digit to a higher value (e.g., 2 10s) is not possible since digits range from 0-9. Therefore, I should raise the quantity to 3 9s, which is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Since there are 16 digits remaining (8 per player), the total 9s could be 2 (if Player 4 has none) or higher. Challenging this bid would reveal the actual count. If the total is 3 or more, Player 4 wins; otherwise, I win. Given the uncertainty and my two 9s, challenging is a reasonable risk.
