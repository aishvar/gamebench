Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I should make a conservative but reasonable opening bid. My hand contains two 6s, two 7s, one 0, one 4, one 5, and one 7. Since there are 6 players, each with 8 digits, the expected number of any digit is about 4.8. I will start with a safe opening bid of 3 7s, as I have two 7s myself, making it likely there are at least three among all hands.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have the digits 0, 9, 2, 4, 7, 9, 8, 7 in my hand. Counting the '7's, I see two '7's. The current bid is 3 7s, which I believe is quite high given I only have 2 '7's. Since increasing the quantity to 4 would be unlikely without more '7's, and increasing the digit beyond 7 (to 8 or 9) would still require at least 4 '7's, which I do not have, I should challenge the bid. The current bid seems overestimated.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round, I need to make an opening bid. My hand contains three 7s (digits: 66740657). Given 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits total. Statistically, each digit should appear around 4 times. Since I have three 7s myself, bidding 3 7s is a safe and credible opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I don't have any 7s in my hand. I can raise the bid to 4 0s, which is a safe and valid bid, increasing the quantity and changing the digit. Given that I don't have any 7s, it's risky to challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. With 5 active players having 8 digits each (40 total), and Player 2 claiming there are at least 4 zeros, this seems plausible. Given my single 0, there would need to be only 3 more zeros among the other 32 digits I can't see, which is reasonable. I could bid higher, but since I only have one 0, I'd be taking a significant risk. The safer play is to bid a higher digit with a lower quantity. Looking at my hand, I have a 5, so bidding '4 5s' maintains the same quantity but uses a higher digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. My hand contains no 5s, and with 40 total digits, it's possible the actual count of 5s is less than 4. Challenging could be a strategic move to eliminate the bidder if the bid is false.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains three 8s. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid based on my hand's highest count (3 8s) is logical. This bid is truthful and sets a baseline for subsequent players to challenge or outbid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. In my hand (66740657), I have no 9s. With 32 digits in play and only needing 3 9s, this is a plausible bid, as it's likely that the other three players could collectively hold 3 or more 9s. Challenging now would be risky. To raise, I look for digits I have multiples of. I have three 6s and three 7s. I can safely bid 3 0s, but 3 9s is already the current bid. To increase, I must either go to 4 of any digit or 3 of a higher digit (which is impossible since 9 is the highest). I have two 0s, so bidding 4 0s is risky. I have three 6s, so bidding 4 6s is reasonable, as I already have three and only need one more among 24 unknown digits. This is a safe and aggressive bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I don't have any 6s in my hand. I could bid 5 0s (increasing the quantity), or 4 of a higher number. Since I have two 4s, bidding 4 7s seems like a reasonable increase that isn't too risky.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains three 8s. The current bid is 4 7s. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid since it maintains the same quantity (4) but uses a higher digit (8 > 7). This leverages my existing 8s and follows the bidding rules.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which is plausible given there are 24 digits in play and two other players. Since it's early in the round and 3 of any digit is reasonable, challenging is too risky. I can make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit to 9, bidding 3 9s, which keeps the quantity the same and puts pressure on the next player.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains three 8s. The current bid is 4 0s. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid since it maintains the same quantity (4) but increases the digit (8 > 0). This leverages my known high count of 8s while adhering to the rules.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. In my hand (66740657), I have zero 8s. With 24 digits in play (8 per player), and knowing I have none, the probability that the other two players together have at least 4 of the 8s is not especially high (each player would need to have 2 or more 8s on average). The bid is plausible but somewhat aggressive. Given the recent bidding history, Player 4 has bid on 8s repeatedly, possibly indicating they have some 8s, but it's unlikely both opponents have enough to reach 4. Therefore, challenging is the best move.

Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to open the bidding this round. My hand is 66740657, which contains three 6s, three 7s, one 0, and one 4. Since I have three 6s and three 7s, opening with a bid of 3 6s is safe and gives me flexibility for future raises. Bidding 3 7s is also possible, but since I have previously opened with 3 7s and Player 2 may expect it, I'll opt for 3 6s to vary my play and keep options open.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 66740657, which contains three 7s. The current bid is 4 7s. For that bid to be valid, my opponent would need to have at least one 7. While it's possible, I'm holding a strong majority of the 7s, so it's unlikely my opponent has the fourth. Statistically, with only 16 digits in play, the probability that Player 2 has at least one 7 is not high enough to justify a higher bid. Therefore, challenging is the best move.
