Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I can start by bidding a low but safe bid to establish a baseline. I have only one '8' in my hand, so bidding '1 8s' seems reasonable. It is the minimal possible bid, and it sets a starting point for others to challenge or raise.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 8s. I don't have any 8s in my hand, but I can bid a slightly higher amount to stay in the game. I can bid 2 of any digit. I will bid 2 0s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 2 0s, which is relatively low. With 5 other players, it's plausible that at least one more 0 exists among them. To keep the game going, I can increase the bid slightly by raising the digit to a higher number that I have in my hand, such as 4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (73586772), I have zero 4s. The current bid is '2 4s' made by Player 2. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Since I have no 4s in my hand, the other 5 players would need to have at least 2 4s among their 40 digits. This is quite possible, so challenging seems risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I notice I have two 7s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 7s. I'll bid '2 7s', keeping the same quantity but using a higher digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8. A bid of 2 7s is relatively low and plausible.  I have two 6s and one 8 in my hand. I can bid 3 6s, which is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 3 6s, to make a valid higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I have no 6s in my hand (79608248) and the total number of digits is 48, bidding on a higher quantity of 6s seems risky. However, I can consider bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity, which would be bidding on 7s or higher. Considering the history, Player 3 previously bid 2 7s, which was surpassed by Player 4's bid of 3 6s. Given my hand does not contain any 7s or higher digits that I can confidently bid on, and considering the risk of challenging versus bidding, I should challenge the current bid of 3 6s because it seems unlikely that there are at least three 6s among all players, especially since my hand does not contribute to this count.

Player 4 Reasoning: It is the start of a new round and I am the first to bid. My hand is 36814267. I have two 6s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. A bid of 1 6s is a safe starting bid, and a bid of 2 6s is also very likely. Given I have two 6s, bidding 3 6s is a slightly more aggressive but still reasonable starting bid, as there are 32 unknown digits among the other players. Bidding 2 6s is a safer play to start the round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s, and I have no 6s in my hand. The maximum total for 6s across 5 players is 5. Bidding 3 6s is impossible since I don't hold any 6s, and the total can't be more than 5. Bidding 2 7s is also impossible because I have no 7s. The only logical move is to challenge, as the bid of 2 6s is very likely accurate given the low total and my lack of 6s. Challenging will verify the actual count and potentially eliminate the current bidder if the count is less than 2.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand (40309549). The current bid is 3 0s, which is plausible given my hand and the total number of digits. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since increasing the quantity to 4 0s might be risky, I'll increase the digit to 1s, which I also have two of in my hand. This seems like a safe move to keep the game going.

Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (73586772), I don't have any 1s. The current bid is 3 1s made by Player 2. With 32 total digits in play and 4 players having 8 digits each, the average frequency of each digit would be about 3.2. Since I have zero 1s in my hand, the other 3 players would need to have at least 3 1s between them, which is certainly possible. I have two 7s in my hand, which suggests 7s might be more common. I could bid 3 7s, but that's risky if other players don't have many 7s. I also have one 5, one 6, and one 8, which I could use for a higher bid. A safer option would be to increase the quantity to 4 of a lower digit. Since I don't have evidence that the current bid is unreasonable, I'll make a higher bid rather than challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 36814267. I have one 1 and two 6s. The current bid is 4 1s. With 32 total digits across 4 players, the average count for any digit is 3.2. A bid of 4 1s is slightly above average. I have one 1, so the other players would need to have three more 1s combined. This is possible but not highly probable. I have two 6s, and the previous bid was 4 1s. Bidding 4 6s is a valid higher bid and seems more likely given my hand and the average distribution.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand (40309549). The current bid is 4 7s, which seems high given that there are only 32 digits in total and 4 players. The likelihood of there being at least 4 7s across all hands is low, especially since I only have one. Challenging seems like the best move.

Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (73586772), I don't have any 0s. Player 1 has bid 1 0s, which is a very low and safe bid to start the round. With 24 total digits in play and me having 8 of them (none of which are 0s), there are 16 other digits between Player 1 and Player 4. It's quite likely that at least one 0 exists among those 16 digits, so challenging would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Since I have two 7s in my hand, I can confidently bid at least 2 7s. However, I could also consider other digits. I have one 5, one 6, and one 3 as well. Given that I have two 7s, bidding on 7s gives me the most confidence.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains two 6s and one 7. The current bid is 2 7s. While I have a 7, bidding higher on 7s seems risky as I only have one. Bidding on 6s is a better option since I have two. I can bid 3 6s, which is higher than 2 7s (higher quantity). This is a reasonable bid given my hand and the total number of digits remaining.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '3 7s' made by Player 1. Looking at my hand (73586772), I have two 7s. For there to be at least 3 7s total, Player 1 and Player 4 combined would need to have at least one more 7. Given that Player 1 increased the bid to 3 7s after Player 4 bid 3 6s, it suggests Player 1 might have at least one 7. This makes the current bid of 3 7s quite plausible. I could safely bid '4 7s' since I know I have two 7s myself, but I think I can make a stronger move. I'll bid '3 8s' which is higher than '3 7s' because it's the same quantity but a higher digit. I have one 8 in my hand, so I'm hoping there are at least two more 8s between the other players.

With 24 total digits, the average count of any digit is 2.4. A bid of 3 8s is slightly above average, but not outrageously high, especially if Player 3 has multiple 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The bid is at '5 6s', meaning Player 1 claims there are at least 5 sixes among all players' hands. Looking at my hand (73586772), I have 0 sixes. For the bid to be valid, Player 1 and Player 4 would need to have 5 sixes between them. With 8 digits per player, this is possible but becoming less likely. Player 4 previously bid '4 6s', suggesting they have at least some sixes. Player 1 increased this to '5 6s', which means they might have at least one six. Given that I have no sixes and the bid is getting high for a specific digit, I could challenge. However, if Player 4 has 3-4 sixes and Player 1 has 1-2 sixes, the bid would be valid. Since I have two 7s in my hand, I could also bid '5 7s', which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This seems safer than challenging, as it builds on my known cards.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have two 6s and one 7 in my hand. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the average count for any digit is 2.4. A bid of 5 7s is significantly higher than average. While I have one 7, it's unlikely the other two players have four or more 7s combined. Bidding 6 0s is a valid higher bid, but it feels too high given I have no 0s. Bidding 5 8s is also a valid higher bid and I have one 8, making it slightly more plausible than 5 7s, but still high. Given the high current bid relative to the total digits and my hand, challenging seems like a reasonable move to put pressure on Player 3.

Since I'm making the first bid of the round, I should bid something I'm confident about. I have two 7s in my hand, which means there could be more in Player 1's hand. A conservative opening bid would be to claim there are at least 2 7s total, which I know is true based on my hand alone. This gives me room to maneuver later in the bidding while starting with a truthful claim.

Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current game state. I have 8 digits in my hand (73586772) and there are 16 total digits between me and Player 1. Looking at my hand, I can see I have two 7s. Player 1 has bid '3 7s', which means they're claiming there are at least 3 sevens total between our hands. Since I already have 2 sevens, their bid is reasonable if they have at least 1 seven in their hand. I could challenge, but it's a risky move since their bid is quite plausible. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I could bid '4 7s', but that might be risky if Player 1 doesn't actually have any 7s. A safer option would be to increase the digit to 8, which I have one of in my hand. So I'll bid '3 8s', keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (73586772), I have zero 0s. Player 1 has bid 4 0s, meaning they believe there are at least 4 zeros between our hands. Since I have none, Player 1 would need to have at least 4 zeros in their hand for this to be true. While possible, it seems unlikely that Player 1 would have 4 or more zeros in an 8-digit hand. The probability of having 4+ zeros in 8 random digits is relatively low. Additionally, Player 1 previously bid 3 7s, which suggests they might have some 7s (I have three 7s). Given this information, I think challenging is the better option than making a higher bid that would require at least 5 digits of a kind or 4 of a higher digit than 0.
