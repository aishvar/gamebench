Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand and with 48 digits total we’d expect about 4.8 ones. Bidding 4 1s means only two more among the other 40 digits (≈92% chance), making this a safe opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have many high digits, bidding a slightly higher quantity or a similar quantity with a higher digit seems reasonable. I will bid 5 1s as it's a straightforward increase in quantity based on my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid of 5 1s is plausible given the average distribution, but bidding 5 7s leverages my own digits to make a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and shifts focus to a digit I have confidence in.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains two 7s, which is the maximum possible total of 7s I can contribute. The current bid is 5 7s, and since I have only 2 7s, I cannot make a higher bid on 7s. The only way to continue is to bid on a higher digit with the same quantity, but that would be 5 8s, which is unlikely given I only have two 8s. Alternatively, I can challenge the current bid, which seems high considering the limited number of 7s in my hand and the total remaining digits. Challenging is the safer move, as the bid appears unlikely to be true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With the average digit count across 40 total digits being around 4, bidding 3 8s seems reasonable given my possession of two 8s. This starts the round with a plausible bid that accounts for potential additional 8s in other players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. My hand contains two 8s. Given that I hold two 8s, it is very likely that there is at least one more 8 among the other 4 players (32 digits total), making the current bid of 3 8s likely true. Challenging would be risky. Bidding higher is the strategic move. My hand's strength is in 8s. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid supported by my two 8s and the general expectation of around 4 total 8s among 5 players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, which is higher than 4 8s. However, it's also possible that there are not 5 zeros. I could also bid 5 8s, since I have one in my hand. Or I could bid 4 9s. Since I have a 9 in my hand, I'll bid 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand. With 40 cards total and expected 4 nines but none in my hand, the other 32 cards have an expected 3.2 nines and only about a 40% chance of containing 4 or more. The bid of 4 9s is unlikely, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. Across 32 digits the expected count of any digit is about 3.2, and I need just two more 1s among the other 24 unseen digits (≈70% chance). Opening with 4 1s is a reasonably safe bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s made by Player 0. I have one 1 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my goal is to make a strategic move, I should consider what I have and the potential risk of being challenged. Given that I only have one 1, bidding higher on 1s might not be the best strategy. I will look for a higher digit that I have in my hand. My hand contains an 8, which is a higher digit than 1. I will bid on the 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have 2 ones in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have a clear count of other players' hands, I should make a conservative bid that is higher. I can see that bidding 4 2s would be a reasonable increase in digit. However, without exact counts of others' hands, I must consider the risk of overbidding. Given my hand, bidding 5 1s seems risky as I only have 2 ones. Therefore, increasing the digit seems safer.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid of 4 2s requires at least four 2s in the remaining 32 digits. I have one 2 in my hand. Given the average expected count of 3.2 for any digit and the lack of evidence of multiple 2s in other players' hands, challenging seems viable. Player 1's bid likely relies on bluffing or marginal support, and the probability of the total being less than 4 is sufficiently high to justify a challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with 3 8s is a reasonable opening bid. This leverages my existing 8s and assumes at least one more 8 exists among the other two players' hands. The bid follows the pattern of previous rounds where 3 8s was a common starting point with reduced player counts.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 2. My hand contains two 8s. With 24 total digits, a bid of 3 8s is quite plausible (expected 2.4). Challenging is risky as it's likely true. Bidding higher is necessary. Based on my hand, the strongest bid I can make is related to 8s. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable step up, leveraging the two 8s I hold and requiring only two more 8s from the remaining 22 digits, which is close to the expected count (2.2). This is more supported by my hand than bidding 3 9s (I have zero 9s) or other quantity 4 bids on digits I have only one or zero of.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand. With 16 unknown digits, the chance of seeing at least four 8s is under 10%, making Player 4’s bid of 4 8s very unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round with 16 total digits. My hand contains two 8s (32845181). In the previous round with 3 players (24 digits), the total count of 8s was revealed to be 4 when Player 0 challenged my bid of 4 8s. Since I had two 8s, the other two players (Player 2 and Player 0) combined had two 8s. Player 0 is now eliminated, leaving only Player 2. It is plausible that Player 2 holds the two 8s that were previously shared between Player 2 and Player 0. If Player 2 has two 8s, the total count would be 4 (my two + Player 2's two). Bidding 4 8s is a strong opening bid supported by this possibility and my hand, and it was a successful bid for me in the previous round.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 8s in my hand, meaning Player 4 needs at least two 8s for the bid to be valid. Assuming independent digit distribution, the probability of Player 4 having >=2 8s is only ~18.7%, making the bid likely false. Challenging has a high chance of success.
