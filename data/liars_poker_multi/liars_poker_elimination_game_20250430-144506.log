Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since it's the first bid of the round, I can bid anything. I have two 0s, two 2s, one 7, one 6, and one 1. Bidding 1 7s is a reasonable starting bid, as I have one 7 in my hand and it's unlikely someone will have a very high count of 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. It is possible that another player also has a 7. I can safely bid 2 7s. I could also bid 2 8s, but I only have one 8, so it is riskier. I do not have any 9s in my hand, so I cannot bid 1 9s. Challenging seems too risky, as the current bid is low and is likely to be true. I will bid 2 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand (the digit 7 appears once). The current bid is 2 7s, which is already quite high considering only 8 digits per player and 6 players total. Since I only hold one 7, bidding 3 7s is impossible. Therefore, challenging the current bid is the best move, as it's unlikely that there are at least 3 sevens among all players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None'. Since there are 5 active players with 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in play. I have one 7 in my hand. The last bid was 2 7s, which was challenged and won, indicating there are at least 4 7s in play. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable, as it increases the quantity of the previous highest bid for 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s made by Player 1. I have 8 secret digits in my hand: 55097649. I can see that I have one 7 in my hand. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 40 and there are 5 active players, each having 8 digits, the total number of digits is 40. Given that Player 1 has already bid 3 7s, and assuming other players might have a few 7s as well, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. However, challenging seems risky as we do not know the actual count yet. I will bid higher with a reasonable guess.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 5 7s seems like a reasonable increase, and I know I can contribute at least two to the total count. It's safer than challenging immediately.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: In my hand, I have zero 7s. The current bid is 5 7s. From the previous round, we know there were at least 4 7s when there were 6 players. Now with 5 players and 40 total digits, having 5 7s is still possible. However, since I have zero 7s, and the bid has escalated quickly from 3 to 4 to 5 7s, it seems unlikely that the remaining players would have accumulated 5 7s between them. The previous challenge revealed 4 7s with more players, so 5 seems risky. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: In my hand of 98890194, I have: two 9s, two 8s, one 0, one 1, and one 4. Since I'm starting the round and know my own hand, I can make a conservative opening bid. Two 9s is a safe start since I can see them in my hand, and 9 is the highest digit which makes it harder to outbid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Given the previous rounds saw bids escalate quickly on the 7s, and the total number of digits is now 32, bidding 3 9s is a reasonable attempt to increase the bid while acknowledging the possibility of a bluff. Bidding 2 9s is not allowed as it's not strictly higher. Bidding a different digit with a quantity of 2 seems risky without knowing the other players' hands. A challenge is also possible, but 2 9s isn't an outrageously high bid given the remaining digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. Player 0 bid 3 9s. With 32 digits remaining across 4 players, it's possible but unlikely that there are 3 9s. However, I should not challenge just yet, as I have a 9 and there could be more 9s in other players' hands. Instead, I'll bid 4 0s, increasing both the quantity and the digit, which seems reasonable given the remaining digits and the distribution seen so far.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is '4 0s' made by Player 1. I have 8 secret digits in my hand: 55097649. I see that I have one 0 in my hand. Given that there are 3 other active players, the total count of 0s could reasonably be higher than 4, especially considering that each player has 8 digits. However, I also need to consider the likelihood of higher digits being present. I have two 9s, and Player 5 and Player 0 have already bid 2 9s and 3 9s respectively. This suggests there could be a significant number of 9s in play. My goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge if the bid seems unlikely. Since I have one 0 and the bid is 4 0s, bidding 5 0s seems aggressive but possible if others have 0s. However, I should also consider bidding on a digit that I know is present in my hand and could be less common.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: In my hand of 98890194, I have one 0. The current bid of 5 0s means there need to be at least 4 more zeros among the other three players' hands. While possible, this seems unlikely given: 1) Players tend to bid on digits they have, 2) Player 1 bid 4 0s suggesting they might have 1-2 zeros, 3) The bidding jumped from 3 9s to 4 0s to 5 0s quickly, suggesting possible bluffing. With only one 0 in my hand and needing 4 more among 24 remaining digits, the probability feels too low to let this bid stand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', which means I can make any initial bid. I have 8 secret digits: 55097649. I see that I have two 0s, two 5s, and one 7. Given that there are 24 total digits remaining across 3 players, bidding 8 0s seems too high as it would imply all players have at least 2 or 3 zeros which is unlikely. A conservative bid based on my hand would be to start with a lower quantity and digit. I will bid '3 5s' as it is based on my hand and not too aggressive.

Player 0 Reasoning: Player 3 bid 3 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Bidding higher than 3 5s is possible. I have two 0s, two 2s, one 1, one 6 and one 7. Bidding 4 0s is a reasonable option, as it increases the quantity. Bidding 3 6s or 3 7s is also possible, but 4 0s is slightly safer given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. There are 24 total digits remaining, which makes it plausible that there could be 4 0s among the three players' hands. However, I do not have enough information to make a higher bid with confidence. Therefore, I will challenge the current bid, as it seems risky for Player 0 to have bid 4 0s without strong information.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None. I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 1 0s is a valid starting bid and doesn't reveal much information about my hand. It's a conservative approach given the limited digits remaining and the previous rounds. I could bid higher, but starting with a low bid allows me to gather more information before committing to a larger claim.

Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, bidding 2 0s seems reasonable as it accounts for my 0 and potentially Player 0's 0.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 3 0s is a logical next step, increasing the quantity while staying within the realm of possibility given my hand. It's a relatively safe bid as I know I contribute two to the total count.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s made by Player 0. I have 3 zeros in my hand (55097649). Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, I should consider the possibility of challenging or bidding. Since my hand contains 3 zeros, which matches the current bid, and I have no information about Player 0's hand, I must assess the risk. Bidding higher would require me to bid at least 4 0s or 3 of a higher digit. However, I only have 3 zeros, so bidding 4 0s would be risky. I should challenge the bid as it seems unlikely Player 0 has 3 zeros without me knowing.
