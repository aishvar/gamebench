Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the round. I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, and one 8 in my hand. Since it's the first bid, I can make a relatively low bid to test the waters. Bidding 1 0s seems reasonable given I have one myself, and it's a low digit so it's less likely to be challenged immediately.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s, which is very low. I have one 0 in my hand (from the digit '0' in 85148647), but since the bid is already at 1 0s, I need to make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since increasing the quantity to 2 0s seems risky without knowing others' hands, I'll increase the digit to 1 1s, which is a safer incremental bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 1s. My hand contains one '7', one '2', one '5', one '9', one '4', one '8', one '9', and one '0'. I have a single '1', but no '1s' in my hand. To beat the current bid, I need to either increase the quantity or move to a higher digit. Given my hand, I cannot confidently bid more than 1 1s because I have no '1s' and only one '7', '2', etc. The total remaining digits are 48, so the total count of '1s' across all hands is likely low, probably just 1 or 2. Bidding higher than 1 1s seems risky, and challenging might be the better move, as the total '1s' is unlikely to be more than 1.

Player 2(Orig:4 - gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14) challenges Player 1(Orig:0 - deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor)'s bid of 1 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand, and the previous round showed there were at least 4 1s in total. Starting with a bid of 1 1s seems safe and conservative, given the information from the last round.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand and no 1s. The current bid of 1 1s is almost certainly correct, so instead of challenging I should raise. Bidding 2 2s is strictly higher and guaranteed by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand of 92075900, I don't have any 2s. The current bid of '2 2s' is relatively low considering there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total digits). Even without any 2s in my hand, it's quite possible that other players have at least 2 twos among their 32 remaining digits. I should make a conservative higher bid. Since I have two 5s in my hand, bidding '2 5s' is safe as I know those exist, and it's higher than '2 2s' because 5 > 2.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s by Player 4. Given that I have two 5s, bidding 3 5s is a reasonable move, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have zero 5s in my hand. Given that there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total digits), and the previous bids show players bidding on low numbers, 3 5s seems plausible, but not overwhelmingly so. I can bid 3 6s, which is a valid higher bid. Alternatively, I could challenge, but with 40 total digits, 3 5s isn't completely unreasonable. I'll bid 3 6s to try and progress the game and see if anyone challenges.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s by Player 0. Given that there are 40 digits in total and 5 players, it's plausible that there are at least 3 6s. However, increasing the bid to 4 6s seems risky as I only have two. Instead, I can bid 3 7s, which is a higher digit but same quantity, based on my hand having one 7.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 8,3,4,5,2,2,8,7, giving me two 8s. The current bid is 3 7s. Raising to 3 8s requires just one more 8 among the 32 unknown digits. The chance of at least one 8 is over 96%, making this a safe increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand. The current bid of '3 8s' requires at least 3 eights among the other 32 digits I can't see. While possible, the bidding sequence shows players being cautious with quantities, suggesting they don't have many high digits. Given my zero 8s and the conservative bidding pattern, challenging seems safer than raising to '3 9s' or '4 anything'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s made by Player 3. I can make a valid bid by increasing the quantity to 3 8s, as I have two 8s and it is a higher quantity than the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that two players have already bid on 8s and one challenge already occurred, it's likely there are more 8s in play. I can bid 4 8s to increase the quantity, but that feels risky. I could bid 3 9s, but that's a significant jump in digit. I could also challenge, but the previous challenge on 3 8s was incorrect (actual count was 6). Considering I only have one 8, and the previous challenge failed, I will challenge again, hoping the bidder is bluffing.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains two 5s. The previous bid was None, so I can start with a bid. I'll bid a quantity of 4 and a digit of 5, as it's a reasonable starting point based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s, which means there would need to be at least 3 more 5s among the other two players' hands (total of 16 digits). Given the previous challenges and outcomes, it's plausible that there are at least 4 5s in total. However, to be safe, I will bid higher by increasing the quantity to 5, targeting a digit I have more of (8s). I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding 5 8s seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I hold two 8s, so to meet a bid of 5 8s there must be at least three more 8s among the 16 unknown digits. The probability of at least three 8s in 16 random digits is only about 21%, making 5 8s unlikely. I will challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand (85148647). The current bid is 3 8s by Player 5. Given that there are only 16 digits in total, and I already have two 8s, it's plausible that Player 5 has at least one more 8 to make the bid valid. However, the bid is relatively low, and challenging it might be risky. A safer move would be to increase the bid slightly to 4 8s, which is still within reasonable limits given the total digits.

However, the previous rounds have shown that the actual count of 8s has been higher than the bids. Given the uncertainty, it's safer to challenge the bid rather than risk bidding higher.
