Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the opening bidder I want a reasonable, defensible starting bid. I hold three 8s in my own eight digits. With 40 unknown digits among the other five players, the expected number of additional 8s is about 4 (40 × 0.1). Therefore reaching a total of at least four 8s is very likely. A bid of 4 8s is modest (below the average of 4.8) yet forces the next player to raise. It is unlikely to be immediately challenged, and if it is, I have a strong chance to win.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have only one 8 in my hand, and the current bid is 4 8s. To beat this bid, I need to bid at least 5 8s or 4 9s. Since 5 8s is possible but unlikely given I only have one 8, and bidding 4 9s would be even less likely, the safest move is to challenge the current bid, as the total number of 8s across all players is unlikely to reach 5. Challenging now maximizes my chances of winning if the bid is false.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first bidder this round and I already have three 8s in my own hand. Out of the remaining 32 hidden digits (4 other players × 8), the chance that there is at least one additional 8 is about 97%, so a bid of 4 8s is extremely safe. I used the same opening bid last round and it proved correct, making opponents less likely to challenge it immediately. This gives me a strong, low-risk starting position.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which is plausible given there are 40 digits in play and 4 other players' hands are unknown. However, with zero 8s myself, I have little information to justify a challenge this early. It's safer to make a minimal higher bid. I have three 5s in my hand, so bidding 4 5s leverages my strong position in that digit and is a valid next bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 03355502, which contains no 8s. The current bid is 4 8s, which is plausible given 40 digits in play, but I have no direct information to challenge. The optimal play is to make the minimum higher bid. I have three 5s, so bidding 4 5s leverages my hand strength and is a safe increment over the current bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I need to bid higher or challenge. I don't have any 9s, and the total number of digits is 40. Bidding 5 of any digit seems risky. I could bid 4 0s, 4 1s, 4 2s, 4 3s, 4 4s, 4 5s, 4 6s, 4 7s or 4 8s. Since I have a 5, I will bid 4 5s.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 67870229. The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand.  With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.  A bid of 5 0s is slightly above average, but not unreasonable, especially since Player 3 made the bid. I have two 2s, one 6, two 7s, one 8, and one 9. I can make a higher bid based on my hand. Bidding on 2s or 7s seems like a good option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold three 8s (8,8,8) in my hand. To beat the current bid of 5 3s I can keep the quantity at 5 and raise the digit. With 32 unknown digits still in play, the expected number of 8s among them is roughly 3.2, giving about an 85% chance that at least two more 8s exist. Adding those to my three makes a total of five or more 8s very likely. This is a safer move than challenging and comfortably outbids Player 5.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 5 8s, which means there need to be at least four more 8s among the other 32 digits. Given that 8s are not extremely rare, this is plausible but not certain. However, I have three 5s and two 3s, which gives me strong holdings in those digits. Since all 5-quantity bids for digits 0, 2, and 3 have already been made, my only legal bid is to increase the quantity to 6 for any digit. I have three 5s, so bidding 6 5s is somewhat aggressive but reasonable since I hold half of the needed 5s myself and it's early in the round. I will bid 6 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I have three 5s in my hand. To bid higher, I could bid 7 0s, or 7 1s, or 7 2s, or 7 3s, or 7 4s, or 7 5s, or 7 6s, or 7 7s, or 7 8s, or 7 9s. Alternatively, I can bid 6 6s. Bidding 7 0s seems like a safe option since I have a 0 in my hand, and it's higher than 6 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 67870229. The current bid is 7 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4.  A bid of 7 0s is already above average. While possible, challenging is an option. However, I also have two 7s and two 2s. Bidding higher than 7 0s is required. I can bid 7 of a higher digit, or increase the quantity. Given my hand, bidding 8 of a digit I have multiple of seems safer than challenging a bid of 7 0s which is not outrageously high. I have two 7s, so bidding 8 7s is a reasonable increase.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. I have one 6, but I can make a higher bid with 9s, as I have none of those either. However, I have two 5s, so I can safely bid on 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In the last round, the actual count of 8s across ALL six players was revealed to be 5. Digits do not change between rounds—only Player 1 (8 digits) has been removed. Therefore, the current maximum possible number of 8s among the five remaining players is still 5, and could be less if Player 1 held any of those 8s. I personally hold 3 of those 5, leaving at most 2 (and possibly 0) 8s in the other four hands. The current bid of 8 8s is therefore impossible. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I start the round and need to make the opening bid. I already hold three 8s (3/32 digits). To satisfy a bid of 4 8s, only one more 8 needs to be present in the 24 unknown digits. With the expected count per digit around 3.2, the chance that at least one additional 8 exists is well over 90%, making this a very safe opening bid that builds on the strong digit in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 5s, two 0s, two 3s, and one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s. With 32 digits in play, the expected average for any digit is about 3.2. The previous round showed that 8s are rare (5 out of 40, then 5 out of 32). I have no 8s, so unless the other players have a lot, 4 8s is a risky bid. However, since this exact bid won a challenge in the previous round, it is possible but still unlikely. Given the history and my hand, I think challenging is the best move.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. With 16 unknown digits in the two opponents’ hands, the expected additional number of 8s is about 1.6, giving roughly an 80% chance that there is at least one more 8. A bid of 4 8s is therefore statistically safe, continues a proven and believable pattern from earlier rounds, and forces the other players to either out-bid or make a risky challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. With only 24 total digits, 4 8s seems plausible. I will increase the bid to 5 0s, as I have one 0 in my hand and it's higher than 4 8s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the average count for any digit is 2.4. A bid of 5 0s is already above average. While I have one 0, bidding higher on 0s feels risky. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s and two 2s. Bidding on 7s or 2s seems more favorable based on my hand strength. Bidding 5 2s is a valid higher bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have only one 2 in my hand, so the other two players would need to have at least four more 2s among their 16 hidden digits. With a 10% chance for any given digit to be a 2, the probability of seeing four or more 2s in 16 draws is roughly 7%. That means there is about a 93% chance the actual count is below five. Challenging is therefore strongly favored over making a higher, riskier bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I hold three 8s (8,8,8) in my eight-digit hand. By opening with 3 8s, the bid is unquestionably true from my perspective, so an immediate challenge would guarantee me the win. If Player 3 chooses not to challenge, they must raise to a higher and likely riskier bid, giving me the option to challenge them on their turn.
