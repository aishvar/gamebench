Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first bidder and the current bid is None. I need to make a starting bid. My hand contains two 6s and two 8s. A bid of 3 6s or 3 8s seems reasonable as a starting point, considering there are 6 players and 48 digits in total. Bidding 3 6s is a safe starting bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The current bid is '3 6s', meaning Player 0 claims there are at least 3 sixes among all players' hands. Looking at my own hand (48051921), I have zero 6s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. The probability of finding at least 3 sixes in the remaining 40 digits (excluding my hand) is reasonable. Since I don't have any 6s to support raising with the same digit, I should either bid a higher quantity of a digit I have or a higher digit. In my hand, I have two 1s, one 2, one 4, one 5, one 8, one 9, and one 0. I could bid '3 7s', '3 8s', or '3 9s' to increase the digit, or I could bid '4' of a digit I have multiple of. Since I have two 1s, bidding '4 1s' seems risky. I'll bid '3 8s' since I have one 8 in my hand and it's a higher digit than 6.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have the hand 72578129, which contains two 8s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I have two 8s, I know that there are at least two 8s in my hand. The total count of 8s must be at least 2 plus whatever other players have. Bidding 4 8s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, bidding 3 9s is also an option as it increases the digit. Given that I have some information about my own hand and the bid is not extremely high, I will choose to bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. There are 48 total digits. Statistically, we expect about 4.8 of each digit. I have one 8 in my hand (95891294). For the bid of 4 8s to be true, there need to be at least 3 more 8s among the other 40 digits (5 players). This is plausible (average would be 4 more), so challenging seems risky, especially since Player 1 bid 3 8s before Player 2 raised to 4 8s. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 4 9s or 5 0s (or higher). I have three 9s in my hand. Bidding 4 9s requires only one more 9 among the other 40 digits, which is highly likely. This is a strong and safe bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand (digits: 30728238). Earlier, Player 2 confidently bid 4 8s, suggesting additional 8s are already in play. With 40 unknown digits remaining, the chance of at least three more 8s among them is high (around 78%), so a total of five or more 8s is very plausible. By raising the quantity from 4 to 5 and returning to the digit 8, I make a strictly higher bid than 4 9s while keeping the risk of a successful challenge low.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand. For the bid to be true, the other 5 players must collectively have at least five 8s among their 40 digits. The expected number of 8s among 40 digits is 4. The probability of having 5 or more 8s is less than 50% (approximately 37%). This means it is more likely (approximately 63% chance) that the total count of 8s is less than 5. Given my hand contributes zero 8s, challenging the bid is statistically favorable.

Player 4 Reasoning: I must open the bidding this round. I already hold two 8s. With 40 digits in play, the expected count for any digit is about four. Given my two 8s, it’s highly probable that at least two more 8s are among the 32 unknown digits, making a total of four or more. This is a sensible, moderately strong opening that still leaves room for future raises.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 8s. The current bid is 4 8s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 4 (40 total digits / 10 possible digits).  Player 4's bid of 4 8s is exactly the expected value, but the previous round showed a high count of 8s (7).  However, challenging 4 8s is risky as it's a very plausible bid, especially given the previous round's outcome. Bidding higher is the safer option. I have two 8s, so bidding 5 8s is a reasonable increase based on my hand and the previous round's information, and it's a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have 8 digits in my hand (48051921), and I see one 8. The current bid is '5 8s' made by Player 0. In the previous round, when Player 5 challenged a bid of '5 8s', the actual count was 7 8s. Now we have one fewer player (5 instead of 6), meaning 8 fewer digits in total. In the previous round, we had 7 8s out of 48 digits. It's reasonable to assume the distribution of digits is somewhat similar. I have 1 eight in my hand, so there would need to be at least 4 more 8s among the other players' hands to make the current bid valid. Given that the previous round had 7 8s, and we now have 8 fewer digits overall, having 5 or more 8s is plausible. I'll make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 9s, which I have one of in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have two 9s in my hand (72578129), so I know there are at least 2 nines. With 32 digits remaining among other players, it's plausible that there are at least 3 more 9s. However, bidding more than 7 9s seems risky given the total count of 9s is unlikely to be that high. I can bid higher than 5 9s by either increasing the quantity or keeping the quantity the same and bidding on a higher digit. Bidding 6 0s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have zero 0s in my hand (95891294). The total number of digits is 40, so the average count for any digit is 4. A bid of 6 is significantly above average, especially since I hold none. However, challenging is risky. My hand contains three 9s. Bidding 6 9s is a statistically sound move. I contribute 3 of the 6 required 9s. We only need 3 more 9s among the remaining 32 digits held by the other 4 players. The expected number of 9s among those 32 digits is 3.2 (32/10). Therefore, bidding 6 9s is plausible, leverages my strong hand in 9s, and forces the next player to make a difficult decision (bid 7+ or challenge).

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The bid is 6 9s. I hold zero 9s, so the other 32 unseen digits must contain all six or more 9s for the bid to be true. With a 10% chance per digit, the expected number of 9s in those 32 digits is 3.2; the probability of there being 6 or more is roughly 11%. This is an unfavorable likelihood for the bidder, giving me about an 89% chance to win the challenge. Raising the bid would force me into an even riskier, less plausible quantity. Therefore, the optimal move is to challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I’m first to act this round, so I must place an opening bid. In my 8-digit hand I hold two 8s. With 32 total digits in play, the expected number of any given digit is about 3.2. Given my two 8s, the chance that there are at least two more 8s among the remaining 24 unseen digits is roughly 70%, making a bid of four 8s statistically sound. I’ve also been the player consistently bidding on 8s in previous rounds, which should make opponents less inclined to challenge an opening bid on that digit. Therefore, 4 8s is a credible yet competitive start.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 8s. The current bid is 4 8s. With 4 players and 32 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 3.2 (32 / 10). An actual count of 4 8s is plausible, especially since the previous round saw 7 8s among 40 digits. However, I have two 8s, which is a strong hand for 8s. Bidding 5 8s is a safe and reasonable increase based on my hand and the previous round's count of 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current state carefully. In my hand, I have 48051921, which contains no 8s. The current bid is 5 8s made by Player 0. From the game history, I can see that in the previous round when Player 5 challenged a bid of 5 8s, there were actually 7 8s total. However, that was with 6 players (48 total digits). Now we're down to 4 players (32 total digits). In the most recent complete round, Player 4 bid 4 8s, suggesting they may have some 8s. Since I have zero 8s in my hand, and we're now working with fewer total digits, 5 8s seems potentially risky but not impossible. I could bid 5 9s, which is higher, or 6 0s, 6 1s, or 6 2s based on the digits I have in my hand. Since I have a 9 in my hand, bidding 5 9s seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. My hand is 72578129, which contains one 9. So, the total count of 9s across all hands must be at least 1 (mine) plus whatever Player 0, Player 1, and Player 4 have. Given that there are 32 total digits and the previous bid was 5 8s, it's plausible that there are at least 5 9s. However, bidding higher than 5 9s requires either a higher quantity or a higher digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, I must increase the quantity. I have one 9, so the remaining 3 players must have at least 4 more 9s to make a total of 5 9s. Bidding 6 9s seems reasonable as it slightly increases the quantity. Alternatively, I could challenge if I think 5 9s is too high, but given the hand history and the fact that Player 3 was eliminated for having a bid of 6 9s that was too high (actual count was 5), I believe bidding 6 0s could be a safer option as it changes the digit and is a relatively low quantity increase.

Player 4 Reasoning: I see only one 0 in my hand. That means at least 5 more 0s must be among the 24 unknown digits for Player 2’s bid of 6 0s to be valid. With a uniform digit distribution, the expected number of 0s in 24 digits is 2–3, and the chance of there being 5 or more is under 10%. Given this low probability, challenging offers a far higher chance of success than trying to out-bid with an even riskier claim.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my own hand. With 16 unknown digits in the other two players’ hands and an expected frequency of roughly one 8 in every ten digits, the chance that there is at least one more 8 among those 16 digits is high (over 80% probability of there being three or more 8s in total). As the opening bidder I want a statement that is strong enough to move the game forward but still very safe against an immediate challenge. Therefore I will start with 3 8s.

Since I have two 8s, and the bid is only 3 8s, it's quite possible there's at least one more 8 between the other two players. Challenging feels risky with my hand. The next logical bid is 4 8s, which increases the quantity by one. This is a reasonable bid given my hand and the total digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand (48051921). Player 0 has bid 4 8s total. This means Player 0 and Player 4 would need to have at least 3 more 8s between them for this bid to be valid. In the previous round, Player 4 started with a bid of 3 8s, suggesting they might have at least one 8. However, Player 0 immediately raised to 4 8s, which could indicate they have multiple 8s or are bluffing. Since I only have one 8, and we need 3 more from the other two players, this is possible but not guaranteed. I could challenge, but it's risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have a 9 in my hand, so I'll bid 4 9s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand. For Player 1’s bid of 4 9s to be correct, all four (or more) 9s would have to come from the 16 unknown digits held by Players 0 and 1. With a uniform digit distribution, the expected number of 9s in those 16 digits is only about 1.6, and the probability of there being at least 4 is roughly 7%. Raising would require bidding at least 5 of some digit, which is riskier than challenging. Given the very low likelihood that 4 9s actually exist, challenging is the strongest play.
