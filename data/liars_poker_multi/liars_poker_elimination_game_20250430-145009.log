Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 58108538, which contains two 0s, two 5s, two 8s, and one 3. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I see in my hand. Bidding on a digit that appears frequently in my hand seems logical. I have multiple 8s, so bidding on 8s could be a good start. However, I should not bid too high. A bid of 5 8s seems like a reasonable starting point because it's a moderate quantity that is likely to be met or exceeded given the number of players and digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. Challenging is risky because I already have one 8, so the other 40 unseen digits need only contain 4 more 8s; that happens a little more than half the time. Instead, I can over-bid by keeping the quantity at 5 but moving the digit up to 9. I hold two 9s, so the other 40 digits would need at least 3 more 9s. With an expected 4 nines among those 40 cards, the chance there are 3 or more is roughly 76%, giving me a much stronger position than challenging. Therefore I will bid 5 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (the digit 9 does not appear in my hand 27268521). Since I have no 9s, the bid of 5 9s is somewhat risky but still plausible. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 5 and increase the digit. The next higher digit after 9 does not exist, so I must increase the quantity to 6 and can bid any digit from 0 to 9. I have two 2s and two 1s, so bidding 6 2s or 6 1s might be reasonable. However, 2 is lower than 9, so I cannot bid 6 2s because the quantity increase is sufficient. The bid 6 1s is valid and plausible. Since I have two 1s, bidding 6 1s seems reasonable. Alternatively, I could bid 6 2s. I will bid 6 1s to increase the quantity and use a digit I have some of, making the bid more credible.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I don't have any 1s in my hand. To make a safe bid, I will increase the quantity to 7 and choose a digit that is less likely to be challenged. I will bid 7 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '7 2s' and my hand '12910290', I notice I have one 2. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 players, each with 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 48. Since the bid '7 2s' is not extremely high, I should consider making a higher bid. A safe increase would be to bid a higher quantity of the same digit or the same quantity of a higher digit. However, without more information about other players' hands, bidding the same quantity of a higher digit seems risky. Given my hand, I could consider increasing the quantity of 2s or bidding on a different digit that I have more of, like 1 or 9. Since I only have one 2, increasing the quantity of 2s might be challenging. Noticing I have two 9s and one 1, and considering the bids made so far, I could try to bid on a digit I have more of, but I must ensure it's a valid higher bid. Bidding '7 9s' would be a higher bid because 9 is greater than 2, and it leverages my hand's composition more effectively.

Player 5 Reasoning: I hold one 9, so for the bid of 7 9s to be valid there must be at least 6 more 9s among the 40 unknown digits. The probability of that is under 25%, so it’s more likely the bid is false. I should challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits among the other four players, the expected number of additional 2s is about 3.2, so bidding 4 2s (requiring only two more beyond my hand) is a safe and reasonable opening bid that pressures others.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have one 2 in my hand (58108538). With 5 active players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in total. The bid of 4 2s is relatively conservative given the total number of digits. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I see one 2 and there are 4 other players who might have 2s as well, bidding 5 2s seems plausible. However, increasing the digit is also an option. I will choose to bid 4 3s, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit, as it is a valid higher bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I hold two 4s while there are still 32 unknown digits among the other four players. Statistically, the chance that at least two more 4s exist in those 32 cards is high (over 80%). The current bid of 4 3s is quite plausible, so challenging would be risky. A safe, minimal raise that leverages my own cards is to keep the quantity the same and increase the digit to 4. This cleanly outbids Player 0 without over-committing.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I must bid higher. I have two 2s and one 1 in my hand. Since the current quantity is 4, I can either increase the quantity to 5 with any digit or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit above 4. Bidding 5 1s is a reasonable step because I have one 1 and 1 is a low digit, making it easier to increase the quantity. Bidding 5 1s is valid and a safe increment.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. The bid of 6 2s needs four more 2s among the other 32 cards. With an expected 3.2 2s in those cards, the chance of ≥4 is only about 40%, so the bid is more likely false. I should challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have one 8, one 5, one 0, one 0, one 8, one 5, one 3, and one 8 in my hand, totaling 3 eights, 2 fives, 2 zeros, and 1 three. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I see 3 eights in my hand, it's likely there's a significant number of eights in total. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable move as it increases both the quantity and the digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: I hold two 9s and one 8. The current bid is 3 8s. With 24 unknown digits remaining, the expected number of any specific digit is about 2.4. Therefore the likelihood that there is at least one additional 9 among the unknown cards (giving a total of 3 or more 9s) is over 90%. Challenging 3 8s would be risky, but raising minimally to 3 9s leverages my strong hand while only slightly increasing the bid, keeping future options open.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand contains the digits 2, 7, 2, 6, 8, 5, 2, 1, which includes no 9s. Given there are 32 digits total, bidding 4 0s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and reasonable since 0s are common. Alternatively, bidding 3 0s would be invalid because the quantity is not higher and digit 0 is less than 9. Therefore, I will bid 4 0s to increase the quantity and keep the bid plausible.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. I could bid 4 1s, but that's risky. Bidding 5 0s is safer as I have one 0, and there are 32 total digits, so it's not unreasonable that there are at least 5 total 0s in all hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, so the total count of 0s across all players must be at least 1 and at most 4 (one from each of the other 3 players). Bidding higher than 5 0s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since the actual count of 0s is likely to be less than 5, challenging seems reasonable. However, I should also consider the possibility that other players might have more 0s. Given the total digits remaining is 32 and there are 4 players, I should analyze the likelihood of the count being at least 5. My hand has 58108538, which includes one 0 and one 8. The previous bid was 4 0s by Player 2, and Player 3 increased it to 5 0s. Considering the count of 0s in my hand and the fact that the previous bidder increased the quantity, it seems plausible that the count could be around 5. However, given that I have one 0, and it's unlikely that all other players have 4 or more 0s (since that would mean 13 0s in total), challenging seems like a viable option. But, I will first evaluate making a higher bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None' as it's the start of the round. I have 8 digits in my hand: 58108538. I can see that I have two 8s and one 5. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and the total number of digits. Since there are 24 digits in total and I have two 8s, I can make an initial bid. Bidding 6 8s seems too high because it assumes a high distribution of 8s among other players. A more conservative bid like 5 5s or 5 8s could be reasonable. However, given that I have two 8s, bidding on 8s seems more informed. I will bid 5 8s as it's a relatively safe starting point, considering the total count and my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I can see only one 8 in my own hand. For Player 0’s bid of 5 8s to be valid, at least four more 8s must be hidden in the 16 digits held by Players 0 and 2. Under a uniform distribution the expected number of 8s in those 16 digits is 1.6, and the probability of there being 4 or more is roughly 7%. Even if Player 0 happens to be holding 3 8s (already an unlikely 3% event for an 8-digit hand), they would still need at least one more 8 from the remaining 8 digits of Player 2, giving them only about a 50% success chance. Overall the bid looks far too optimistic, so challenging is the best move.

I have one '2', one '7', one '6', one '5', and two '1's, but no '9's or '0's. Bidding 3 9s is a modest increase and more believable than jumping to 4 0s. Therefore, I will bid 3 9s.

To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since my hand doesn't support a high count of 9s or higher digits, I'll consider increasing the quantity. Bidding 4 9s is a valid move as it increases the quantity. However, given that I don't have any 9s and the total count of 9s is likely low, I should assess the likelihood of the bid being true. With 16 digits remaining, a count of 3 or 4 nines is plausible but challenging to verify. I will bid 4 0s to increase the quantity and change the digit, making it a more strategic move.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s made by Player 2. I had previously bid 4 0s. I can see my hand: 58108538. It contains two 1s. Considering there are 16 digits in total and I have two 1s, it's plausible that the total count of 1s is at least 4. However, I should consider the likelihood and my next move. I can either challenge or bid higher. To bid higher, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit to 2 would be a valid move, making it 4 2s. However, I should assess if this is likely. My hand has one 2, so it's possible there are more 2s. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to 5. Given that there are 16 digits and I have two 1s, bidding 5 1s seems reasonable as it slightly increases the quantity, and it's still a relatively low digit. I will choose to bid 4 2s as it's a safer increase in the bid by changing the digit rather than the quantity.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. To bid higher, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. My hand has two 2s, one 1, one 5, one 6, one 7, one 8, and one 2. Since 2s are already bid at 4, I can increase the digit to 3 or higher at the same quantity of 4, or increase the quantity to 5 with any digit. Given I have no 3s but do have one 5 and one 6, bidding 4 3s might be risky. Bidding 4 3s is the next valid bid, but since I don't have any 3s, bidding 4 4s or 4 5s is better. I have one 5, so bidding 4 5s is plausible. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 5 with a low digit. I have one 1, so bidding 5 1s is a possible bid. Given the previous bids and my hand, bidding 5 1s seems a reasonable step up, as it raises quantity and the digit is low, making it more plausible. Challenging 4 2s might be risky because 2s are common digits and the opponent could have them. Therefore, I will bid 5 1s.

However, I should assess the likelihood and consider a bid that is higher or challenge if it seems too high. Bidding 5 2s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have two 2s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 5 and increase the digit. Since increasing the quantity to 6 might be risky without more 2s, bidding 5 3s is a valid and reasonable increase. This bid is higher than 5 2s, and 3s are a plausible digit to bid on.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s made by Player 2. My hand is 58108538, which contains two 3s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since there are 16 digits in total and I have 8 of them, I can estimate the likelihood of the count of 3s or higher digits. Bidding 5 4s seems reasonable as it increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid. I have one 5 and no 4s or higher digits except for one 8, so bidding 5 4s or 5 5s might be too high, but it's worth trying to increase the digit. However, considering my hand and the fact that the previous bid was 5 2s, it's likely that there are at least some 3s. Thus, I will bid 5 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity to 6 or keep the quantity at 5 but increase the digit above 4. I have only one '4' in my hand and one '2', two '1's, and one '5', among others. Bidding 5 5s seems reasonable since I have a '5' and the bid is a slight increase in digit with the same quantity. Increasing the quantity to 6 seems risky because I only have one '4' and one '5', and I doubt the total count of any digit at 6 is likely given my hand and the previous bids. Therefore, I will bid 5 5s.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have the hand 58108538, which contains two 5s. Given that there are 16 digits in total and I have 8 of them, the remaining 8 digits are with Player 2. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand has two 5s, the total count of 5s must be at least 2. Bidding 5 6s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit, making it a higher bid. I should bid 5 6s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one '6' in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I must increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. The next valid bid is 5 7s or 6 0s. Since I have one '2', one '7', and one '8', but no '7's or '0's, bidding 5 7s is plausible but risky. Bidding 6 0s is a bigger jump and less likely to be true given my hand. Considering the total digits and previous bids, 5 7s is a reasonable next bid to challenge the opponent's claim while keeping the bid credible.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have the hand 58108538, which contains two 7s and no 5s or 6s. The total count of 7s across both hands is at least 2 (mine) plus some unknown number from Player 2's hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 7s, the total count of 7s must be at least 2. Bidding 6 7s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity. However, I should consider if it's likely that Player 2 has more than 3 sevens. Given the history of the game and the fact that we've been gradually increasing the bids, I should assess the likelihood of Player 2 having a significant number of 7s. If I bid 6 7s and it's challenged, I risk losing if the total count is less than 6. On the other hand, challenging 5 7s directly is risky because if the count is 5 or more, I lose. My hand has a good number of 8s (three 8s), so bidding 5 8s is a viable option as it increases the digit. It's a safer bet given my hand's composition.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have only one '8' in my hand, so I cannot confidently support a higher bid on 8s. The next valid bids must be either 6 of any digit or 5 of a digit higher than 8 (i.e., 5 9s). Given the total digits are 16 and the previous bids, bidding 6 of any digit seems risky without stronger evidence. Bidding 5 9s is the minimal increase but I have only one '9' and no strong reason to believe there are many 9s. Therefore, challenging the bid of 5 8s is a reasonable move since it might be an overestimate.
