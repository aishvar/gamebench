Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid of the round, I need to start with a reasonable bid. I have one 8, one 6, and two 4s in my hand. Bidding 3 4s seems like a safe starting point, as it's likely that other players have at least one 4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand and the current bid is only three 4s. With 40 unknown digits and an expected 4s count of around four, bidding four 4s is plausible and increases the quantity. It’s a safe raise based on my hand and the expected distribution.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 78965373, which contains no 4s. The current bid is 4 4s by Player 1. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an average of 4.8 of each digit is expected across all hands. A bid of 4 4s is slightly below average and plausible, but since I have none, it feels a bit high to me. However, challenging might be risky early in the game with limited information. I’ll make a higher bid instead. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 5 7s feels reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit, and I can support part of the count myself.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 7s and my hand of 14410147, I notice I don't have any 7s. However, considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 players, the maximum possible count for any single digit is 48. Since I don't have any 7s and the bid is already at 5 7s, I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. Making a higher bid would require either bidding a higher quantity of 7s, which seems risky given I have no 7s, or bidding the same quantity but a higher digit, which is not possible since 7 is already the digit being bid on. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit with a higher quantity, but given the information and my hand, challenging seems like a safer option because the current bid of 5 7s might be too high given the distribution of digits across all players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet in this round and I am starting the bidding, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand is 78965373, which includes two 7s and two 3s. Bidding on 7s seems reasonable as I have two of them, and with 40 total digits across 5 players, it's plausible there are a few more 7s. I'll bid 4 7s to start, which is a moderate increase over a typical starting bid and aligns with my hand strength while leaving room for others to bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand contains zero 7s, making challenging risky as 4 is close to the expected number of 7s across 40 digits. My hand contains two 8s. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and only requires 2 additional 8s among the other 32 digits held by the other 4 players. This is a very plausible scenario.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. I can bid 5 8s, which is a safe increase. There are 40 total digits, so 5 of a single digit is plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Given that there are 40 digits remaining and 5 players, it's plausible that there could be 5 8s in total. However, bidding higher on 8s is risky. I have two 6s in my hand, and it's likely that there are at least 6 6s in total across all hands. Bidding 6 6s is a safer and valid higher bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 6s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits and an expected ~3.2 sixes, the chance of at least 6 sixes is under 10%, making the current bid highly unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. Across 32 total digits we’d expect about 3.2 4s on average, so bidding 4 4s is below expectation but high enough to seize the initiative safely.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:1 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 78965373, which contains two 7s, two 3s, and one each of 8, 9, 6, and 5. The current bid is 4 4s by Player 1. I have no 4s in my hand, so I must rely on the likelihood of 4s in other players' hands. With 32 total digits across 4 players, an average of 3.2 of each digit is expected if digits are uniformly distributed. A bid of 4 4s is slightly above average but plausible. However, since I have no 4s, it means the other 3 players must collectively have at least 4 4s among their 24 digits, which is possible but not guaranteed. I could challenge, but the risk is high as the bid isn’t extremely unlikely. Instead, I’ll make a safer bid of 5 7s, leveraging the two 7s in my hand. This increases the quantity and changes the digit, which should be reasonable given the total digits and my contribution to the count.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:2 - openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s across 32 total digits. My hand contains zero 7s. This means all five or more 7s must be among the other 24 digits held by the other three players. The average expected number of any digit in 24 random digits is 2.4. A bid of 5 is significantly higher than this average. Based on probability, the chance of having 5 or more of a specific digit in 24 random digits is low (around 7%). While Player 2 has previously bid 7s, the quantity relative to the total digits this round makes 5 7s a high bid. Since I have no 7s to support a higher bid, and the current bid seems statistically unlikely, challenging is the optimal move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round with no current bid to beat, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand is 78965373, which contains two 7s and two 3s, among others. Since there are 24 total digits across three players, I can bid on a digit I have some of, to make it believable. Bidding 3 7s is a safe starting point, as I already have two 7s, and it's likely there is at least one more among the other 16 digits. This bid also leaves room for others to escalate while not appearing overly aggressive early in the round.

Player 1 Reasoning: I only have one 7 in my hand, leaving 16 unknown digits. With a 10% chance per digit, the expected number of 7s among them is 1.6, and the probability of getting at least three is only about 21%. A total of four 7s is therefore unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 78965373, which contains no 1s. The current bid by Player 5 is 2 1s, meaning there should be at least two 1s across all 16 digits. Since I have none, the likelihood of there being at least two 1s depends entirely on Player 5's hand. With only 16 total digits, and knowing my 8 digits have no 1s, it's possible but not highly likely that Player 5 has two or more 1s in their 8 digits. However, bidding higher is safer at this stage. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 3 7s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 2 1s, and I can support part of the count myself.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 78965373, which contains three 7s. The current bid by Player 5 is 4 7s, meaning there should be at least four 7s across both our hands (16 digits total). Since I have three 7s, Player 5 must have at least one 7 for the bid to hold. Given that there are only 8 digits in Player 5's hand, it's possible they have one or more 7s, but it's also risky to assume they have exactly what's needed. However, since the total possible 7s could be up to 16, and I already contribute three, a bid of 4 7s is plausible but on the lower side of likely. I could challenge, but the risk is high since only one more 7 is needed. Instead, I will bid higher with 5 7s, as I can justify it with my three 7s and it's a reasonable escalation, pushing Player 5 to either challenge or bid higher.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. I could bid 6 7s, but that seems risky. Instead, I will bid a higher quantity of a different digit. I have three 1s, so I will bid 6 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 78965373, which contains three 7s but no 1s. The current bid by Player 5 is 6 1s. With only 16 total digits across both players, a bid of 6 1s means that at least 6 out of 16 digits must be 1s, which is a 37.5% probability per digit if distributed randomly. Since I have zero 1s in my 8 digits, Player 5 would need to have at least 6 1s in their 8 digits for the bid to hold, which is highly unlikely (less than 1% chance for exactly 6 or more 1s in 8 digits under random distribution). Even if Player 5 is bluffing based on a few 1s, the probability of them having such a high count is low. Bidding higher, such as 7 1s or switching to another digit, carries risk since I have no 1s and limited high counts of other digits (e.g., two 3s, one each of other digits). Given the low likelihood of 6 1s existing, challenging seems the better option over escalating the bid further.
