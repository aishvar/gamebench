Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 26598902, which gives me two 9s, two 2s, and one each of 6, 5, 8, and 0. Starting with a conservative bid based on my strongest digit, I will bid 3 9s. This is slightly above my personal count of two 9s, assuming at least one other 9 exists among the remaining 40 digits across the other players, which is statistically reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which is likely true given the expected distribution of digits. Bidding 4 9s increases the quantity while maintaining the digit, which is plausible since there are 40 remaining digits. Challenging the current bid would be risky as it's probable to hold.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 9s is risky without knowing other players' hands. I can either bid a higher quantity of a different digit or challenge. Considering I have a 7, bidding 5 7s is a possibility, but that's a significant increase. Given I have no 9s, and 4 is already a considerable number, challenging seems like the most logical option. It's unlikely that there are 4 nines across all players, and I have no nines to contribute.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since there are five active players, and each has eight digits, it's plausible that other players hold additional 9s. Bidding 4 9s builds on my existing 9s and aligns with the previous round's successful bid of 4 9s, making it a reasonable starting point for this round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my own hand. With 40 total digits in play, the expected count for any digit is about 4. Needing just three more 3s among the 32 unseen digits gives well-over a 50% chance (roughly 60%+) that the bid will be true. Challenging 4 9s would succeed only about 60% of the time, so making a higher, well-supported bid is the safer move. Increasing the quantity to 5 and choosing the digit 3 satisfies the requirement of being strictly higher than 4 9s.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have the hand 67317170, which contains two 7s, one 3, and no other 3s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I see one 3 in my hand and there are 4 other players, it's plausible that there are at least 5 3s in total. However, I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I will increase the digit to make a higher bid. Bidding 5 4s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and keeps the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have 0 4s in my hand, so all 4s must be in the other 32 digits across 4 players. The average expected count for any digit is 4 (40 total digits / 10 digits). Since the bid requires at least 5 4s, which is above average, and Player4's bid likely relies on bluffing or limited information, challenging is statistically favorable. If the count is less than 5 (which aligns with average distribution), I win the challenge and eliminate Player4.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand. Starting the round, bidding 4 1s is a reasonable opening bid, as it's likely there are at least four 1s across all four players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:1 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 26598902, which contains no 1s. The current bid is 4 1s by Player 5. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 4 1s is plausible as it represents only 12.5% of the total digits, which is a reasonable expectation for a single digit. I don't have any 1s myself, but statistically, it's likely that among the other 24 digits, there could be at least 4 1s. Challenging seems risky given the low bid relative to total digits. Instead, I will make a higher bid. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 4 9s feels safe and builds on previous bids in the game history where 4 9s was confirmed to exist with more players. Since the number of players has decreased, it might still be close but is a reasonable escalation from 4 1s.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:2 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 0. I hold two 9s in my hand, and the expected total number of 9s across 32 digits is ~3.2. Bidding higher (e.g., 5 9s) would require at least three additional 9s from opponents, which is unlikely. Challenging the bid of 4 9s is justified because the probability of the total being ≥4 is low given my two 9s and the average distribution.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 26598902, which contains two 9s, one 6, one 5, one 8, one 2, and one 0. Bidding on 9s seems reasonable as I have two of them, and with three players each having 8 digits (total 24 digits), it's plausible that there could be more 9s in other hands. I’ll start with a conservative bid of 3 9s to gauge the other players' responses while keeping the bid believable based on my own hand.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:0 - o3-2025-04-16) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Challenging 3 9s is dangerous: Player 0 has twice been exactly right on bids of 4 9s, and I have zero 9s, so 3 9s could easily be true. Instead, I’ll raise the quantity. I hold two 3s myself, so only two more are needed among the sixteen unknown digits held by Players 0 and 5—about a 50% chance if the digits are random. Bidding on a digit I already have multiple copies of is safer than continuing with 9s, so I’ll increase the bid to 4 3s.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:4 - qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have no 3s in my hand, so all 3s must be in Player 0 or Player 3's hands. With 16 digits spread across two players, the statistical expectation for any specific digit (like 3) is ~1.6 per player, totaling ~3.2 combined. This makes the bid of 4 3s slightly above the expected distribution. Since Player 3 placed the bid, they might be bluffing or holding a marginal number of 3s. Challenging leverages the low probability of the bid being valid, especially given my lack of 3s and the limited remaining digits.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand. Bidding 4 1s is reasonable as it's likely Player 0 has at least one 1, making the total count sufficient. This bid leverages my own digits while maintaining a plausible threshold.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 26598902, which contains no 1s. The current bid by Player 5 is 4 1s out of a total of 16 digits across both hands. Since I have zero 1s, all 4 would need to be in Player 5's hand of 8 digits, which is possible but not extremely likely (about a 12.5% chance if digits are random). However, given the history of aggressive bidding and challenges, I think it's safer to bid higher rather than challenge. I have three 9s, so bidding 4 9s feels reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 4 1s. This keeps me in the game without taking an immediate risk on a challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand. Since there are only 16 total digits remaining across both players, Player 0's bid of 4 9s requires them to have at least 4 nines in their 8-digit hand. Statistically, holding 4+ of a single digit is highly improbable in a random 8-digit hand, especially when I have none. This bid is likely a bluff.
