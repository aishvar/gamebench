Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I can make an opening bid. I have two 9s in my hand. I will bid a small amount of 9s to start.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have the hand 33006525, which contains no 9s. Given that there are 6 players and each has 8 digits, the total count of 9s is unlikely to be very high. However, I should consider the possibility that other players might have 9s. My hand has a total of 2 zeros and other digits but no 9s. A reasonable next bid should be higher than 2 9s. I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since 9 is the highest digit, I can only increase the quantity to make a higher bid. Bidding 3 9s seems like a cautious increase, considering the total number of digits is 48 and the distribution is random.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Since the bid of 3 9s is very likely to be true across 48 digits, challenging is risky. By raising to 4 6s I increase the quantity, satisfying the rules, and base the bid on a digit I already hold two of. The other 40 unknown digits need to contain only two additional 6s, which is highly probable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. Given that there are 6 players with 8 digits each, there are 48 digits total. It's possible, but unlikely, that there are 4 6s. Player 1 bid 3 9s, and I have two 9s, so I know there are at least two 9s. Player 0 bid 2 9s. Bidding higher than 4 6s without knowing the distribution of digits is risky. Challenging seems like the best option, as 4 6s is a relatively high number and I have no 6s to contribute.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I am the first to act this round. Out of my eight digits, I hold two 6s. With 40 digits in play, the expected count of any given digit is about 4. By bidding 4 6s I’m asking for just two more 6s among the 32 unknown digits, which is highly likely (≈84% chance). Using the same digit that just won a challenge also makes opponents less eager to contest it immediately. This is a safe, credible opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I’m starting the round and must place an opening bid. I see two 6s in my own eight-digit hand. On average, with 32 total digits, we expect roughly 3.2 of any given digit to be in play. I only need one more 6 among the other 24 hidden digits for a total of three, which has about a 92% likelihood (1 – 0.9^24). A bid of 3 6s is therefore very safe for me—hard to challenge successfully yet high enough that the next player must either raise or risk a weak challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s, and I know I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 4 6s would be a logical step, increasing the quantity since I only have one 6, and no other player has bid higher. Challenging the current bid seems risky because the total number of 6s could reasonably be 3 or more, given the previous bids and my own hand. Therefore, I will raise the bid to 4 6s, which is plausible and consistent with my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I could bid higher, but since the game history shows that previous bids of 4 6s have been successful (actual count was 5), it seems risky to challenge. I will bid 5 6s to increase the pressure.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have the hand 33006525, which contains two 6s. Given that there are 32 digits in total and the current bid is 5 6s, it's plausible that there are at least 5 6s since two other players have already bid on 6s, indicating they might have some. However, considering the total count of 6s, I have to assess if increasing the bid is reasonable. I see that I can bid 5 7s, which is a higher digit with the same quantity, or increase the quantity. I'll analyze my hand and the history. My hand has 2 sixes. To make a higher bid, I can either keep the digit and increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since I have two 6s, and there are 6 other players' digits I don't know, it's possible there are more 6s. However, I can bid 5 7s as it's a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Across the 32 total digits, the expected count for any specific digit is about 3.2. I see only one 7 in my own hand (68256753), so the other 24 unknown digits would need to contain at least four more 7s for Player 1’s bid of 5 7s to be correct. The chance of getting at least four 7s in 24 random digits (p≈0.1 each) is roughly 20 %, meaning there is about an 80 % chance the real count is below five. Those odds strongly favor a challenge rather than making a shaky higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: As the opening bidder with 8 of the 24 total digits, I want a bid that is believable but still gives me room to maneuver later. I hold two 5s, so only one more 5 is needed among the 16 unknown digits for the bid to be valid. Statistically, the chance that at least one 5 appears in those 16 digits is over 80%, making the bid reasonably safe. Going higher (e.g., 4 5s) would require two more 5s and is far more likely to be challenged. Therefore, starting with 3 5s balances credibility and pressure on the other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s, and I have the digits 7, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 6, 8 in my hand. Counting the 5s, I see zero in my hand. The total possible count of 5s across all players is unlikely to reach 3, given the total of 24 digits and the previous bids. Bidding higher with 4 5s seems risky since I have none, and challenging the current bid might be prudent if I believe the count can't reach 3. However, I have no 5s, so the actual count is at most 0 or 1, making the current bid of 3 5s impossible. Challenging is the best move.

Player 2 Reasoning: There is no current bid, so I must open. I hold two 6s, which guarantees that a bid of 2 6s is true no matter what Player 0 has. Opening any higher quantity would depend on unknown cards and could be challenged successfully. Therefore a safe, challenge-proof opening is 2 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Since there are only 16 total digits, I could bid 3 6s. However, Player 2 has been winning a lot of challenges as the bidder. It might be safer to bid 3 of a digit I don't have, to avoid revealing information about my hand. I'll bid 3 7s, as I don't have any 7s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I only have a single 7 in my eight-digit hand. For Player 0’s bid of 3 7s to be true, they would need at least two 7s in their eight digits. Randomly, the chance of an opponent holding two or more 7s in eight digits is under 20%, making the bid unlikely. Challenging now gives me a much better than even chance to win the game immediately.
