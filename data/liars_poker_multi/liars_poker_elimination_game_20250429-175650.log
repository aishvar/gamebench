Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no previous bid has been made, I have the opportunity to start the bidding. My hand contains the digits 2, 9, 5, 5, 6, 7, 5, 0. Counting these, I have three 5s, one 2, one 9, one 6, one 7, and one 0. To make a strong opening bid, I should choose a reasonable quantity and digit based on my hand. Bidding '3 5s' reflects the three 5s I hold, and it's a plausible bid given the total of 48 digits across 6 players. Starting with this bid is conservative yet competitive, encouraging others to challenge or bid higher.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. I could challenge, but since it's early in the game, a safe play is to increase the bid slightly. I can bid 4 0s, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. I have 2 3s, 2 4s, 2 9s, 1 2, and 1 6. Since the bid is for the digit 0, I should bid on a different digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 twos. I have no 2s in my hand, so I cannot rely on my own cards to support that bid. However, the previous bids were 3 fives and 4 zeros, so the bidding is increasing reasonably. To make a valid higher bid, I can increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Bidding 5 threes is a valid next step and plausible given the number of digits in play. I will bid 5 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 3s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have a 3 and a 6 in my hand (19083675), and considering the total digits remaining (48), I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit seems more reasonable because the total count of any digit cannot exceed 48. Given that I have a higher digit (6) in my hand, I can try to bid on that, keeping in mind the distribution of digits might not be even. A bid of 5 4s or higher seems risky without knowing the exact distribution, but bidding on a higher digit like 6 could be a safer bet if I assume not all players have the same digits. Therefore, bidding on 5 6s seems like a balanced approach, considering both the need to increase the bid and the uncertainty of the digit distribution.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 33735449. I have three 3s, two 4s, one 5, one 7, and one 9. The current bid is 5 6s. I have no 6s.  With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4.8. A bid of 5 6s is slightly above average, but not extremely high. However, since I have zero 6s, and the bid is already at 5, it's more likely that the other players don't have enough 6s combined to reach 5.  Challenging seems like a reasonable move given my hand and the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 3s, two 4s, one 5, one 7, and one 9 in my hand. As the first bidder in this round with 5 players and 40 total digits, I need to make an opening bid. A bid of 6 3s is a reasonable starting point given I hold three 3s and there are 32 unknown digits across the other 4 players. This is a strong bid based on my hand without being overly aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The previous bid was 6 3s. Since the actual count was 4, the bid was false, and the challenger (me) would win if I challenge now. However, I have a 3 in my hand (once), so challenging might be risky if the total count is close to the bid. To avoid losing immediately, I can consider raising the bid slightly to test the current count. My hand contains one 3, so I can bid 7 3s or 6 4s. Bidding 7 3s is risky because I only have one 3, so I cannot support that. Bidding 6 4s is a safe higher bid in terms of digit, but I only have one 4. Alternatively, I can raise the quantity to 7 with the same digit 3, which I cannot support. Therefore, the best move is to challenge, as the previous bid of 6 3s is unlikely to be accurate, given the previous challenge outcome and my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 3s and two 4s in my hand. Since I am the first to bid in this round and the current bid is None, I can make any valid starting bid. I will start with a bid based on my strongest digit, the 3s. Bidding 5 3s is a reasonable starting point, considering there are 32 total digits and I have 3 of them.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s, which means the previous bids have escalated the count of zeros. I have only one zero in my hand (98632588), so I cannot strongly support a high number of zeros. The bid of 7 zeros seems plausible but somewhat high given the total digits (32). However, since the bid must be strictly higher than 7 0s, I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding 7 8s is a reasonable next step, increasing the digit and making it a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 7 8s. With 4 players and 32 total digits, the expected number of any digit is around 3.2 (32 / 10). A bid of 7 8s is significantly higher than this average. While it's possible there are many 8s among the other players, a bid of 7 8s feels quite high, especially since Player 3 jumped from 7 0s to 7 8s. Given my single 8, I don't have strong support to bid higher on 8s or confidently bid 8 or more of another digit. Challenging seems like the safer play given the high bid relative to the expected distribution and the lack of support in my hand.

Since I'm the first to bid, I need to make a reasonable opening bid. Given I have three 3s, bidding 5 3s seems like a safe starting point, accounting for the possibility of other players having some 3s as well.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand. With only 24 total digits, a bid of 7 6s seems quite high, especially since I don't have any. The expected number of 6s would be around 2.4 (24 digits / 10 possible digits). While luck can play a role, 7 is significantly above the expected value. Given that I have no 6s, the other two players would need to have a combined total of at least 7 6s, which is unlikely. Challenging seems like the best move here.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have no 3s in my hand.

With only two players and 16 total digits, a bid of 6 4s means Player 1 is claiming they have at least four 4s in their hand (6 total - 2 in my hand = 4). This seems quite high given there are only 8 digits in their hand. A bid of 6 4s is already a high bid relative to the total digits. While I could potentially bid 6 5s or higher, challenging 6 4s seems like a strong play given the probability of Player 1 having four or more 4s is low.
