Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid. My hand is 97700532. I have two 0s and two 7s. The total number of digits is 48 across 6 players. The expected average count for any digit is 4.8 (48/10). A safe opening bid is typically based on the digits in hand and slightly below the expected average. I have two 0s. Bidding '3 0s' is a conservative opening bid, leveraging my hand and starting with the lowest digit, forcing subsequent players to increase the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. Looking at my hand (27819268), I don't have any 0s. The current bid is '3 0s' made by Player 0. There are 6 active players with 8 digits each, for a total of 48 digits in play. Since I don't have any 0s, there are at most 40 digits among the other players that could be 0s. It's quite possible that there are at least 3 zeros among those 40 digits. I could challenge, but it seems risky given the low bid. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have one 1, one 2, two 2s, one 6, one 7, one 8, and one 9 in my hand. I could bid '3 1s', '3 2s', or even '4 2s' since I have two 2s in my hand. I'll go with '3 2s' as a conservative but higher bid than '3 0s'.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand (30221145). The current bid is 3 2s. Since I have two 2s, it's plausible that at least one other player has a 2, making the bid of 3 2s possible. However, I can make a slightly higher bid that is still reasonable based on my hand. I have two 1s and two 2s. Bidding 3 3s is a valid higher bid, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This seems like a safe progression.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. Since the current bid is 3 3s, bidding 3 6s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid is truthful because I know there are at least three 6s in total (my own), making it safe if challenged later.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. The previous bids were relatively conservative, with no bid exceeding a quantity of 3. Given that there are 48 total digits remaining and 6 players, a bid of 4 7s seems reasonable, as it increases both the quantity and the digit. This bid is likely to be higher than the current bid while still being plausible.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have zero 7s in my hand. While challenging is an option, the bid of 4 7s is close to the average expected count (4.8 among 6 players), meaning it could be true, especially if Player 4 holds some 7s. My hand contains two 2s. Bidding 5 2s is a valid higher bid (increased quantity from 4 to 5). This bid is plausible, as it only requires three additional 2s to be present among the other 40 digits held by the remaining 5 players. Bidding based on my hand strength feels safer than challenging a potentially true bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have one 2 in my hand (97700532). The total number of digits is 48 (6 players * 8 digits). The expected average count for any digit is 4.8. A bid of 5 2s is very close to the statistical average, making a challenge risky. I need to make a higher bid. Options include increasing the digit (5 3s, 5 4s, etc.) or increasing the quantity (6 0s, 6 1s, etc.). I have two 7s. Player 4 previously bid 4 7s, suggesting there might be several 7s in play. Bidding 5 7s is higher than 5 2s. This bid implies a total of five 7s across all hands. Since I hold two 7s, this requires only three more 7s among the other 40 digits (5 players). This is below the statistical average of four 7s expected in those 40 digits, making it a relatively safe and plausible bid, especially considering Player 4's prior bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The current bid is 5 7s made by Player 0. In my hand, I have one 7 (27819268). With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For the bid of 5 7s to be valid, there need to be at least 5 sevens across all hands. I already know of 1 seven in my hand, so there would need to be at least 4 more sevens among the other 5 players, which is certainly possible (less than 1 per player on average). Player 4 previously bid 4 7s, suggesting they might have at least one 7. Given this information, the bid of 5 7s seems reasonable. I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s and two 8s, but no strong concentration of any digit. I'll bid 5 8s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average number of any digit is 48/10 = 4.8. A bid of 5 8s is slightly above average. However, with 6 players, the probability of having at least 5 of a specific digit is not extremely low, especially if someone has multiple. Given my hand has no 8s, and the bid is only slightly above the average, I will bid higher based on the digits I do have. I have two 2s and two 1s. Bidding 6 0s is a safe increase from 5 8s, and the 0s are likely to be present in other hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. With 48 total digits and my hand containing no 0s, the average expected count of 0s across all players is ~4.8. Since the bid requires at least 6 0s, which exceeds this average, and Player 2’s bid likely represents a bluff or overestimation, challenging appears statistically favorable. Additionally, no player has shown strong prior interest in 0s beyond the initial bid, reducing confidence in the bid’s validity.

A conservative starting bid is usually around the average expected count of a digit (Total Digits / 10 = 40 / 10 = 4). I have two 2s, which is a good starting point.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. I have no reason to believe that 3 2s is an invalid bid. I have one 9 in my hand and 40 total digits remaining. Bidding 4 9s increases both the quantity and the digit.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. With 40 total digits remaining, the average expected count for any digit is 4. Challenging a bid of 4 9s is risky as it's at the expected value. My hand contains two 2s. Bidding 5 2s is a valid higher bid (quantity 5 is greater than quantity 4). This bid requires the other 4 players (with 32 digits combined) to have a total of at least three 2s, which is close to the expected number of 2s (3.2) among them. This seems like a reasonable and safer bid based on my hand compared to challenging or bidding higher quantities of other digits I have fewer of.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have one 2 in my hand (97700532). This means the other 4 players (32 digits) must have at least four 2s combined for the bid to be true. The statistical average is 4 (40 total digits / 10 possible digits). Player 2 bid 3 2s and Player 5 raised to 5 2s this round, suggesting multiple 2s might be held by them. Challenging 5 2s seems risky as it's plausible. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 5 3s, 5 4s, ..., 5 9s, or 6 of any digit. I have two 7s. Bidding 5 7s is a valid higher bid. Last round, Player 4 bid 4 7s and I bid 5 7s, indicating some belief in 7s. With two 7s in my hand, claiming a total of five 7s across 40 digits (requiring 3 more from the other 32 digits) is a reasonable and defensible bid based on my hand and history.

Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. My hand contains 27819268, which includes one 7. The current bid is 5 7s, meaning Player 0 believes there are at least 5 sevens among all players. Since I have 1 seven, there would need to be 4 more sevens among the other 4 players to make this bid valid. That's an average of 1 seven per player, which is reasonable. I could bid 5 8s, but I already have 2 eights in my hand, making this a strong bid. Alternatively, I could bid 6 2s since I have 2 twos in my hand, or I could increase to 6 7s, but that seems risky given I only have 1 seven. Given my hand strength with 8s, bidding 5 8s seems most strategic.

A bid of 5 8s is slightly above average, but not extremely unlikely, especially since Player 1 might have a couple of 8s. However, I have two 2s and two 1s. I can make a higher bid based on my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The last round ended with a challenge on 6 1s, which failed. This suggests players are more cautious.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I need to bid higher, meaning at least 4 of any digit. My hand contains two 2s, making a bid of 4 2s a strong possibility. I need only two more 2s from the remaining 24 digits across the other three players, which is statistically likely (expected 2.4). Challenging 3 9s is risky as I have one 9 and the expected count in other hands is also significant. Therefore, bidding 4 2s is the most reasonable action.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have one 2 in my hand (97700532). The total number of digits is 32, so the expected number of 2s is 3.2. For the bid of 4 2s to be true, there need to be at least 3 more 2s among the other 24 digits held by the other 3 players. The expected number of 2s in those 24 digits is 2.4, so 3 is plausible. Player 5, who made the bid, has bid 2s aggressively in previous rounds (5 2s twice). Challenging seems risky.

I need to make a higher bid. Options are 4 3s through 4 9s, or 5 0s onwards. My hand contains two 0s and two 7s. 
- Bidding based on 0s: I have two 0s. Bidding 5 0s would require 3 more 0s from the other 24 digits (expected 2.4). This is plausible. There were 6 0s confirmed in the first round (48 digits).
- Bidding based on 7s: I have two 7s. Bidding 5 7s would require 3 more 7s from the other 24 digits (expected 2.4). This is also plausible. I have bid 5 7s in the previous two rounds, and Player 4 bid 4 7s in the first round. Continuing with 7s leverages my strong holding and bidding history.

Comparing 5 0s and 5 7s, both seem reasonable. However, bidding 5 7s aligns with my previous actions and might put more pressure on the next player due to the established pattern. It's a confident bid based on having two 7s.

For this to be true, there would need to be 4 more 7s among the other three players' hands. This is certainly possible, as each player has 8 digits, so the other three players could easily have more than 4 sevens combined. However, I want to make a strategic move. I could bid 5 8s, as I have two 8s in my hand, which gives me better confidence. Alternatively, I could bid 6 2s since I have two 2s in my hand. I'll go with 6 2s as it increases the quantity, which is a stronger move than just increasing the digit value.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s, made by Player 4. There are 3 players remaining, with a total of 24 digits. The expected count for any digit is 24 / 10 = 2.4. A bid of 6 is significantly higher than the expected value. My hand (48321925) contains only one 9. For the bid of 6 9s to be true, there must be at least 6 - 1 = 5 more 9s among the remaining 16 digits held by Player 0 and Player 4. The probability of getting 5 or more 9s in 16 random digits is very low (less than 2%). Making a higher bid would require bidding 7 or more of any digit, which is even less likely to be true (claiming nearly 3 times the expected value). Given the low probability of the current bid being true and the difficulty of making a valid higher bid, challenging is the most strategic move.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s made by Player 5. I have one '2' in my hand (97700532). This means Player 5 needs at least two '2's in their 8-digit hand for the bid to be true, which is plausible. Challenging seems risky. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 3 3s up to 3 9s, or 4+ of any digit. My hand contains two '7's and two '0's. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Since I have two '7's, this bid only requires Player 5 to have at least one '7', which is statistically likely (expected value 0.8). This is a safer bid than challenging or bidding on digits where I hold fewer copies, like bidding 4 0s (requiring two '0's from Player 5) or 3 3s/5s/9s (requiring two of those digits from Player 5). Bidding 3 7s leverages my hand strength and puts pressure on Player 5.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s by Player 0. My hand contains zero 7s. With only 16 total digits remaining (8 in my hand, 8 in Player 0's hand), the entire quantity of 7s for the bid to be true must come from Player 0's hand. For the total count of 7s to be 3 or more, Player 0 must hold at least three 7s in their 8 digits. The probability of a player having 3 or more of a specific digit in a random 8-digit hand is low (approximately 4%). Given this low probability, challenging the bid is the most favorable action.
