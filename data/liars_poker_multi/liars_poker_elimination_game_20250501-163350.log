Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: There are 48 digits remaining across 6 players. With no previous bids, I can start with a conservative estimate based on my hand. I have one 2, one 3, one 4, one 6, and two 8s. Bidding 3 8s seems like a reasonable starting point, as it is likely that at least three 8s exist among all players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. With 48 total digits among 6 players, the expected average quantity for any digit is 4.8. The bid of 3 8s is low and statistically likely to be true, making a challenge risky. I have one 8. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 3 9s or 4 [any digit]. My hand contains two 6s (96867575). Bidding 4 6s is a valid higher bid. Since I hold two 6s, only two more 6s are needed from the remaining 40 digits held by other players. Given the statistical expectation of 4.8 sixes total, needing only 2 more makes this a relatively safe and justifiable bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 6s' by Player 1, I must decide whether to bid higher or challenge. My hand contains 00664130, which includes one 6. Since the current bid is '4 6s', I need to consider if there could be at least four 6s among all players. With 48 total digits and 6 players, each having 8 digits, it's possible but not guaranteed that there are four or more 6s. Considering I only have one 6, and without knowledge of other players' hands, bidding higher on 6s might be risky. However, I also need to consider bidding on a different digit. Given my hand, I have two 0s and one 1, 3, 4, and 6 each. Bidding on 0s or any other digit I have more than one of could be a safer strategy, but I must ensure the bid is higher than '4 6s'. Since I don't have enough information to safely bid higher on 6s and considering the distribution of my hand, challenging '4 6s' seems like a reasonable option, especially since I only have one 6 and the bid seems somewhat high without more information about other players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: It's my turn to start the bidding round. I have 8 digits: 9, 6, 8, 6, 7, 5, 7, 5. This means I have two 5s, two 6s, and two 7s. With 40 total digits in play (5 players * 8 digits), the expected average count for any digit is 4. A safe opening bid would be based on a digit I hold multiples of. Bidding 3 7s is a reasonable start. I have two 7s, and it's statistically likely there's at least one more 7 among the other 32 digits. Bidding 3 is below the average of 4, making it relatively safe, and using the highest digit among my pairs (7) forces the next player into a higher bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 4 7s would be a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have some information from the previous round that higher bids are possible. Bidding 3 8s would also be valid, but I prefer to increase the quantity since I have a 7. I will bid 4 7s.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits and a 10% chance per digit, the expected number of 7s is 3.2 and the probability of there being at least 4 sevens is only about 40%. It’s more likely than not that the bid of 4 7s is false, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. With 32 total digits, the expected total count of 9s is about 3.2; given I hold one, opponents likely hold about 2.2, so there’s roughly a 70% chance of at least three 9s. Opening with 3 9s is a reasonable, safe bid and as the highest digit at quantity 3 it forces others to jump to 4 to overbid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which requires a higher quantity or digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, I must increase the quantity. Bidding 4 9s is logical as my hand already contains three 9s, and there's a chance others have at least one more.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have two 9s in my hand, which makes this bid possible. However, there are only 32 digits remaining across 4 players, making it unlikely that there are 4 or more of any other digit. I should challenge the current bid of 4 9s.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains three 9s. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid that reflects my hand's highest count (3 9s) is logical. This establishes a baseline for subsequent bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (96867575). There are 24 total digits among the 3 remaining players. For the bid to be true, there need to be at least two more 9s among the 16 digits held by Player 4 and Player 5. The expected number of 9s in those 16 digits is 1.6 (16 * 0.1), so needing two more is quite plausible, especially since the previous round showed five 9s among 32 digits involving players 4 and 5. Challenging seems risky. I should make a higher bid. I have two 6s, two 7s, and two 5s. Bidding 4 of any of these requires two more from the other 16 digits, which is plausible. I will bid 4 6s, leveraging my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I see I have only one 6 in my hand. To make Player 1’s bid of 4 6s true, there would need to be at least three more 6s among the 16 unseen digits, which is quite unlikely (around an 18% chance). It’s more probable the bid is false, so I should challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand and bidding 1 9s is guaranteed true. As the highest digit at quantity 1 it forces Player 5 to increase the quantity rather than the digit on their turn, giving me better control.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. The current bid is 1 9s, which is true. To make a higher bid, I can increase the quantity. Bidding 2 9s is a valid move, as it's higher than 1 9s.

Player 4 Reasoning: I hold one 9, so for there to be at least two 9s, Player 5 must have at least one 9 in their 8 cards. The chance of that is about 57%, meaning a 43% chance the bid is false. Any raise to 3 of a digit has under a 19% chance of being correct. Challenging gives me the highest win probability.
