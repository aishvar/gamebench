Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 99838367, which contains multiple 8s and 3s. A reasonable starting bid could be based on the digits I have. I have two 8s and three 3s. Considering the total number of players and digits, bidding on a digit I have in abundance seems sensible. I'll start with a bid that reflects a moderate count of a digit I hold, taking into account the total number of digits in the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 63653964, which contains three 3s. The current bid is 12 3s by Player 0. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an average of 4.8 of each digit is expected across all hands. I have 3 out of the 8 digits in my hand as 3s, which is above average for my share. However, for the total to reach 12 3s, the remaining 5 players would need to have an average of about 1.8 3s each, which is plausible but on the higher side. I could challenge, but the risk is significant since it's not an extreme bid. Instead, I’ll make a safer bid of 13 3s, increasing the quantity slightly to test the waters and see if others challenge or continue bidding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 3s in my hand. With 48 digits total, the expected number of 3s is about 4.8 and getting 13 is extremely unlikely. The bids of 12 and then 13 3s seem implausible, so I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. With 32 unseen digits, I expect at least two more 4s, making a total of four likely. Starting with a bid of 4 4s is reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s, which is close to the average expected count for a digit (40 total digits / 10 digits = 4). Challenging an average bid is risky. My hand (20190232) contains three 2s, which is a strong concentration of a single digit. Bidding 5 2s is a valid higher bid (quantity 5 is greater than quantity 4) and is well-supported by the three 2s in my hand, making it a plausible and strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. Bidding higher than 5 2s is necessary. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 6 2s seems risky given I only have one 2. Increasing the digit to 5 3s seems reasonable as I have two 3s in my hand. Alternatively, I could challenge, but 5 2s doesn't seem impossibly high with 40 total digits remaining and 5 players. Therefore, I will bid 5 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 3. The current bid claims there are 5 threes total among all players. With 5 active players having 8 digits each (40 total), this is quite plausible. Given that Player 1 was eliminated for overbidding on 3s earlier (actual count was 7), and the game has progressed with fewer players, 5 3s seems reasonable. Based on my hand having one 3, and the previous round revealing information about 3s, I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. I'll bid 5 4s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have one 3 and no 4s or higher digits relevant to the current bid in my hand (99838367). To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll have to make an educated guess. Bidding 5 5s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit. However, I should also consider the likelihood of the current bid being true. Given that there are 40 digits in total and the current bid is for 5 4s, it's possible but I should be cautious. I'll choose to bid 5 5s as it's a relatively safe increase in digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 5s in my hand. With 32 unknown cards, the expected number of 5s is about 3.2 and the probability of at least five 5s is only around 20%. The bid of 5 5s is unlikely, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: With 32 total digits and 24 unknown, each digit appears ~2.4 times on average. I hold two 4s, so expecting ~4.4 total 4s makes bidding 4 4s reasonable—and it leverages my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s by Player 2. My hand contains zero 4s, which makes me skeptical of the bid, although 4 4s is not an extremely high bid for 32 total digits (expected 3.2). I have three 2s in my hand. Bidding 5 2s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity than 4 4s) and is strongly supported by my hand, requiring only two additional 2s from the other 24 digits (expected 2.4). This is a safe and strategic bid that leverages my hand strength and passes the decision to the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. Bidding 6 2s would be a reasonable bluff, as it's a direct increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 3s (two 3s) or 4s (one 4). Since the previous rounds saw challenges on higher bids, I want to avoid a high quantity bid. Increasing the digit while keeping the quantity at 5 seems safer. I have one 4, so bidding 5 4s is plausible. However, given the history of challenges, I think increasing the quantity of 2s slightly is the best option, hoping Player 3 is bluffing.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: In my hand, I have only one 2. The current bid claims there are 6 twos total across all hands (32 digits). While not impossible, this would mean the other three players would need to have 5 twos between them to make this true. Given that Player 3 previously bid 5 2s and Player 4 only increased it by one, this suggests they might be bluffing. With only one 2 in my hand, and needing to see 5 more among just 3 other players, this seems unlikely. A challenge is the safer move than trying to bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: It's the start of a new round with only three players. The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. I have one 3, one 4, two 2s, and one 0. Bidding 2 4s is a reasonable starting point, as it's a digit I have and isn't overly aggressive given the limited number of total digits (24).

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. Challenging 2 4s would always lose since there are at least my two 4s. I can safely raise to 3 4s, which only needs one more 4 among the other 16 cards (about 82% chance).

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 20190232, which contains three 2s. The current bid is 3 4s. Bidding 4 2s is a valid higher bid as the quantity (4) is greater than the current bid's quantity (3). This bid is well-supported by my hand, as I only need one additional 2 from the remaining 16 digits held by the other two players for the bid to be met. This seems like a strong and relatively safe move compared to challenging the current bid of 3 4s, which I have no information about from my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. Bidding 5 2s would be a reasonable increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 5, and two 8s. Bidding 2 8s would be lower than the current bid, so that is not an option. Bidding 3 3s is a valid bid, but I don't want to reveal information about my hand unnecessarily. Increasing the quantity of 2s seems like the best option, even though I only have one 2, as it's a relatively low digit and the other players may not have many either.

Player 4 Reasoning: It's the start of a new round with only two players. The previous bid was challenged and won, so the other player is likely to be cautious. I have three 3s, one 0, one 8, one 4, one 5, two 2s. Bidding 3 3s would be a reasonable starting bid, leveraging my hand. It's higher than the initial bid of 'None' and doesn't seem overly aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s by Player 4. There are 16 total digits across two players. My hand is 20190232, which contains one 3. For the bid of 3 3s to be true, there must be at least two more 3s in Player 4's hand (1 from me + 2 from P4 = 3). Assuming Player 4's 8 digits are random, the probability of them having 2 or more 3s is approximately 19% (1 - P(0 threes) - P(1 three)). This means there is about an 81% chance that Player 4 has 0 or 1 three, making the total count of 3s less than 3 and the bid false. Challenging the bid offers an immediate win with a high probability (approx. 81%). While I could make a bid like 4 2s (I have three 2s, Player 4 needs one 2 for 4 2s to be true, which has about a 57% chance), challenging the current bid provides a significantly higher chance of winning the game immediately.
