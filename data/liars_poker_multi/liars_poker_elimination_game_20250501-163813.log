Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I must open the bidding. My hand contains two 4s. With 40 unseen digits spread among five other players, the chance that at least two more 4s exist is high, making a total of four 4s very plausible. This is a reasonable opening bid that isn’t so low it’s trivial to outbid but isn’t extreme enough to invite an immediate challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 3, 5, 9, 2, 9, 3, 6, 3. Counting the 4s in my hand, I see zero. The current bid is 4 4s, which I believe is unlikely given the total of 48 digits and my own hand. Since I have no 4s, challenging the bid seems appropriate, as the total number of 4s across all players is likely less than 4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. With 40 digits in play, the expected number of any particular digit is about 4, so needing only two more 4s among the 32 unseen digits gives roughly an 84% chance the bid is true. Last round the same opening bid of 4 4s was validated (there were 6), so opponents are less likely to challenge it immediately. This makes 4 4s a solid, defensible opening that also sets a meaningful bar for later bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains a 5, and bidding 4 5s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid than 4 4s. Challenging risks losing if the actual count of 4s is 4 or more, which is plausible given 5 players each holding 8 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 47500660, which contains one 5. The current bid is 4 5s made by Player 2. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, an average of 4 of each digit is expected across all hands. Since I only have one 5, it’s possible but not highly likely that the remaining 3 fives are distributed among the other 4 players. However, challenging now carries a risk since the bid is not excessively high. I will make a higher bid instead, moving to 5 5s to test the waters and see if others challenge or continue bidding. This bid is slightly above average expectation but still plausible.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 2 0s is a safe and logical next step, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same. It's a reasonable bid given my hand and the current state of the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I hold exactly two 4s in my hand (digits: 16234924). By keeping the quantity at 2 and raising the digit to 4, I make a strictly higher bid that I know is guaranteed true—my own hand already satisfies it, so any challenge would eliminate the challenger with zero risk to me.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have one 4 in my hand, and with 32 total digits remaining, it's possible the actual count is only 1. Challenging this bid could expose the liar, as the total 4s might not meet the required quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I start the round and want a bid that is unquestionably safe. I hold exactly two 4s, so the statement that there are at least 2 fours in total cannot be false no matter what the other 16 hidden digits are. If either opponent challenges immediately I win for sure, and if they don’t I’ve set a low baseline that leaves me room to maneuver later.

Player 5 Reasoning: Player 4 bid 2 5s. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity while maintaining the digit. It's a plausible bid given my hand and the current game state. I don't have enough information to confidently challenge.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:2 - o3-2025-04-16) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold no 5s, so while 3 5s might be overstated, both opponents have been bidding on 5s, suggesting they each hold at least one. Challenging would therefore be a coin-flip at best and could easily eliminate me. A safer move is a small raise. I have one 6, and the chance that the other 16 hidden digits contain at least two more 6s is roughly 50%. By bidding 3 6s I legally top the current bid while presenting something plausible enough that neither opponent is likely to risk an immediate challenge, letting me stay in the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. Player 4 has been aggressive and seems confident. Bidding 4 7s is risky as it's a significant increase and I have no information to support it. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid, but still relies on other players having 8s. I believe challenging the 3 7s is the best option, as it's unlikely that there are three 7s among the remaining three players' hands (24 total digits remaining).

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is None. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 4 5s is a reasonable starting bid, as it's higher than any previous bid and I have some of the digit in my hand. It also doesn't seem overly aggressive given the limited total digits remaining (16).

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand 16234924 contains zero 5s. For the current bid of 4 5s to be true, Player 5 would need at least four 5s in their eight digits. Randomly, the chance of having 4 or more of a specific digit in just 8 digits is well under 1%. Given this improbability and that raising would force me to make an even riskier claim, the best play is to challenge.
