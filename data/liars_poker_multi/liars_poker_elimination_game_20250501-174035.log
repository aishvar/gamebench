Player 1 Reasoning: I have four 7s in my hand. Bidding 4 7s is a safe bid since the total count of 7s across all players must be at least 4, making this bid truthful.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s, which means there would need to be at least 3 more 7s among the other 5 players (40 digits). Given the low probability of this, I should challenge the bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have four 7s in my hand. Bidding 4 7s is certain since the total count cannot be less than four. This bid cannot be successfully challenged, making it the safest opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:4 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 4 (40/10). The previous round showed the actual count of 7s was 6, which is higher than the current bid. However, the current bid of 4 7s is exactly the expected value. Given I only have one 7, bidding higher on 7s (like 5 7s) seems risky. Bidding on another digit with a quantity of 4 or higher is also an option, but I don't have a strong hand in any other digit to support a higher bid confidently. Challenging 4 7s is also risky because the actual count was 6 in the previous round, and it's the expected value. Given the history and my hand, bidding 4 8s is a safe increase in digit while keeping the quantity at the expected value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. My hand contains 68510602, which has zero 8s. Player 3 has bid 4 8s, meaning they believe there are at least 4 eights among all 40 digits. In the previous round, we discovered there were 6 sevens when there were 48 total digits. Now with 40 digits, it's still plausible there could be 4 eights total, even though I don't have any. Since I don't have strong evidence to challenge, I should make a higher bid. I have one 9 in my hand, so I could bid 4 9s. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to 5 of a digit I have multiple of (like 0s, as I have two 0s). I'll go with 5 0s since I have some in my hand, making it more likely to be true.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 0s and my hand of 13394166, I notice I have one 0, but bidding on 0s might not be the best strategy since the quantity is already at 5. Considering the total digits remaining are 40 and there are 5 players, each having 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 40. Since I have two 1s and one 6, I could consider bidding on either of these digits. However, given that the current bid is on 0s and I only have one 0, increasing the quantity of 0s might not be feasible. Instead, I could try to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same or slightly higher. But, looking at my hand, I don't have enough of any single digit to confidently bid higher than 5 without risking a challenge. Given the bidding history, players have been somewhat conservative. However, the last bid of 5 0s seems relatively high for a digit that might not be as common, considering my own hand doesn't have many 0s. This makes me skeptical about the likelihood of there being at least 5 zeros among all players. Therefore, challenging the current bid seems like a viable option, especially since the total number of digits is 40, and distributing 5 zeros evenly might be plausible but not guaranteed, especially with the information from my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. I have two 1s, two 3s, two 6s, and one 9 and one 4 in my hand. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 32 and I have 8 digits, I can make an educated guess. Since I have two 1s and they are the most frequent digit in my hand, I will bid on the digit '1'. The quantity should be reasonable, considering there are 32 digits in total and I have 2 of them. Bidding 3 1s seems like a safe start, as it's possible other players might have at least one '1' in their hands, making the total count of '1s' at least 3.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand. With 32 total digits across 4 players, the probability of there being at least 4 zeros is low (estimated ~22% based on binomial distribution). Player 0's bid of 4 0s is likely incorrect, making challenging the optimal move.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have four 7s in my hand. With 24 total digits remaining across three players, bidding 5 7s is reasonable since even one additional 7 in other players' hands would satisfy the bid. This leverages my strong position in 7s and follows historical patterns where 7s have been successful in prior rounds.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 29791244. I have one 7. The current bid is 5 7s. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the expected number of 7s is around 2.4 (24 * 0.1). A bid of 5 7s is significantly higher than the expected value and the previous history shows players challenging bids that are likely too high. Given I only have one 7, it's unlikely there are 4 more 7s spread across the other two players. Challenging seems like the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have four 7s in my hand. Since the total number of digits remaining is 16 (8 in my hand and 8 in Player 5's hand), bidding 4 7s is a truthful bid because there are at least 4 7s in total (even if Player 5 has none). This makes it impossible for Player 5 to successfully challenge the bid, as the actual count cannot be less than 4. Starting with this safe bid forces Player 5 to either raise the stakes or risk losing immediately if they challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 7s by Player 1 and considering the total digits remaining is 16, I have to make a decision based on the likelihood of the bid being true and the potential for a higher bid. My hand contains 13394166, which does not have any 7s. Since the total number of digits is 16 and we are down to the last two players, each having 8 digits, the bid of 4 7s seems plausible but challenging it could be risky. However, considering the distribution of my digits and the fact that I don't have any 7s, I need to think about the probability of there being at least 4 7s in total. Given that I have no 7s and the bid is for 4 7s, and knowing that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, I must consider if bidding higher is feasible or if challenging is the safer option. Since I don't have enough information to confidently bid higher and considering the risk of challenging, I should think about the safest strategy. Given the constraints and the information available, challenging seems like a viable option because if the actual count of 7s is less than 4, I win. However, this decision heavily depends on the perceived likelihood of the current bid being true, which is difficult to assess without more information about Player 1's hand. Considering all factors, including the risk of elimination and the potential gain, I must weigh my options carefully.
