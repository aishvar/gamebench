Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s is a safe starting point since it's guaranteed to be true (my own digits) and allows room for higher bids. With 5 other players, there's likely more 6s, making this a conservative and reasonable first bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, so the current bid of 4 sixes relies entirely on the other 40 unknown digits. The probability of at least 4 sixes among 40 digits (p=0.1) is only about 58%, so challenging is risky. Instead, I can bid 4 sevens: I have one 7, so I only need three more among the 40 unknown, which has a ~78% chance. This is a safe raise while keeping the quantity low.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. With 48 total digits (6 players * 8 digits), the statistical average for any digit is 4.8. A bid of 4 is very close to the average, making a challenge risky, even though I have zero 7s in my hand (13685010). The expected number of 7s among the other 5 players is 40/10 = 4, making the total expected number exactly 4. Instead of challenging, I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 0s and two 1s. Bidding based on these digits is strategically sound. Options are 4 8s (I have one 8), 4 9s (I have zero 9s), 5 0s (I have two 0s), 5 1s (I have two 1s). Bidding 5 0s leverages my hand; having two 0s makes a total of 5 seem more plausible than 4 7s (where I have none). The expected number of 0s is 4.8, and with my two 0s, the expected total is 2 (mine) + 4 (others) = 6. Bidding 5 0s is a reasonable step up.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 93668813, which contains no 0s. The current bid is 5 0s made by Player 3. With 48 total digits across 6 players, an average of 4.8 zeros would be expected if distributed evenly, so 5 zeros is close to the expected value and quite plausible. I don't have any information from other players' bids about zeros specifically, as previous bids were on 6s and 7s. Challenging now might be risky since 5 0s is not an extreme bid. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. I have three 8s in my hand, so bidding 5 8s feels reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 5 0s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have no 8s in my hand, meaning all 5+ 8s must be in the other 40 digits. The expected number of 8s in 48 digits is ~4.8, but with 0 in my hand, the remaining digits have an expected 4 8s. Bidding 5 is slightly above average but risky. Since I have no 8s, the actual count is more likely below 5, making a challenge favorable.

Player 4 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet in this round and I am starting the bidding, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand is 93668813, which contains three 8s and two 6s. Bidding 3 8s is a safe starting point as I know at least three 8s exist in my hand alone. With 40 total digits across 5 players, it's plausible that more 8s could be out there, but I'll start with a bid that reflects my own strength to avoid overbidding early.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s. The current bid is 3 8s. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages my existing 9s. Since I have no 8s, challenging the bid of 3 8s would be risky given the likely presence of 8s in other players' hands. Bidding on 9s aligns with my hand and maintains plausible deniability.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s, and I need to bid higher. My hand contains one 8, one 6, two 4s, one 2, and one 1. Given the total of 40 digits, and considering the previous bids, it's unlikely that there are 3 or more 9s across all hands. I can safely increase the digit to 0 or 1 with a quantity of 3, but since the previous bid was 3 9s, I must bid higher. Bidding 4 0s seems reasonable because I have no 9s, and the total possible count of 0s across all hands could reach 4, especially with multiple players. Alternatively, I could challenge if I think the previous bid is too high, but given my hand, I don't have enough 9s to support a bid of 3 9s, so challenging seems safer. However, since the previous bid was 3 9s, and I have only one 8, I think challenging is the best move to test the validity of the bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round, I need to establish a bid based on my hand. I have three 6s in my hand (96769556). Bidding 4 6s is reasonable because I already have three, and it's likely at least one other player has a 6. This increases the quantity from the previous round's starting bids and uses a digit I hold, making it a defensible position.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 4 6s is reasonable, as it slightly exceeds my own count and there are two other players with 8 digits each. This bid is conservative (only 4 total) and gives me a good chance to win if challenged, since even if the other players have no 6s, my three plus one from elsewhere would make 4. Bidding on 6s also leverages my existing holdings.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 0. I have one 6 in my hand (13685010). This means Player 0 and Player 4 need to have at least three 6s combined in their 16 digits for the bid to be true. Player 0 won the previous round with the exact same bid (4 6s) when there were 32 total digits and the actual count was 6. Now, with only 24 total digits, the expected number of 6s is lower (2.4 vs 3.2). Repeating the same bid is aggressive and could be a bluff, making a challenge tempting. However, Player 0 might have retained their 6s or be confident. Instead of challenging, I can make a higher bid based on my hand. I have two 0s and two 1s. Bidding 5 0s requires three more 0s among the other 16 digits. This is statistically similar in likelihood to the current bid being true, but it leverages the strength of my hand (two 0s) and shifts the pressure to Player 4. Bidding 5 0s seems like a safer and more strategic move than challenging Player 0 directly on a bid they just won with.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 93668813, which contains no 0s. The current bid by Player 3 is 5 0s across all 24 digits in play. Since I have no 0s, the other two players (Player 0 and Player 3) must collectively have at least 5 0s in their 16 digits for the bid to be true. This seems plausible given that 0s could be distributed among them. Bidding higher, I can go to 5 1s or higher quantity. However, I have strong counts of 6s (three in my hand) and 8s (two in my hand). Bidding 5 6s feels safer as it leverages my own hand strength, and with a total of 24 digits, it's reasonable to assume there could be two more 6s among the other players.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. The current bid is 5 6s. Bidding 6 6s increases the quantity, and since I already have three, it's plausible the total across all players meets this.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s made by Player 0. I have one 6 in my hand (13685010). This means Player 0 and Player 4 must have at least five 6s combined among their 16 digits for the bid to be true. Player 0 initially bid 4 6s, Player 4 then bid 5 6s, and Player 0 raised to 6 6s. This strong bidding sequence on 6s by two different players suggests challenging is risky, as it's plausible there are indeed six or more 6s. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 6 7s, 6 8s, 6 9s, or 7+ of any digit. I have one 8. Player 4 successfully bid 3 8s in the previous round and won a challenge on 5 8s in the round before that, indicating they might hold 8s. Bidding 6 8s requires five more 8s across the other 16 digits. Given Player 4's history with 8s and my own 8, this seems like a plausible next step compared to bidding 7 of a digit (which would require five more of that digit from 16, based on my two 0s or two 1s) or bidding on digits I don't possess (7s, 9s). Bidding 6 8s increases the digit while keeping the quantity, leveraging previous game history.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s made by Player 3. In my hand, I have three 8s out of my 8 digits. With a total of 24 digits across three players, the maximum possible number of 8s is 24. Since I have three 8s, there could be up to 21 more 8s in the other players' hands, making the bid of 6 8s plausible but not extremely high. However, looking at the bidding history, Player 3 has been aggressive with bids like 5 0s previously. I could challenge, but the risk is high since 6 8s is within a reasonable range (25% of total digits). Instead, I’ll make a higher bid to push the game forward and test the other players. I’ll bid 7 8s, increasing the quantity while staying on the same digit, as I have a decent number of 8s myself.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 0. There are 16 total digits (8 for me, 8 for Player 0). My hand is 13685010, which contains only one 6. For Player 0's bid to be true, Player 0 must hold at least three 6s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, holding three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is statistically less likely than holding two or fewer. Bidding higher would require me to bid at least 4 7s or 5 of something. Bidding 5 0s or 5 1s (based on my two 0s and two 1s) would require Player 0 to hold at least three of that digit, which also seems risky and might invite a challenge. Challenging the 4 6s seems slightly more favorable, as it relies on Player 0 having fewer than three 6s.
