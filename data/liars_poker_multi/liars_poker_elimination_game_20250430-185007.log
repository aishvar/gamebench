Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With 48 total digits, the expected number of 8s is about 4.8, so bidding 3 8s is a safe opening—likely backed by at least one more 8 among opponents—while still restricting same-quantity raises to only 3 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 1's bid of 4 8s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (60904565), I don't have any 8s. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. Player 1 is claiming there are at least 4 8s among all players. Without any 8s in my hand, there would need to be at least 4 8s among the other 40 digits. While this is certainly possible, it's not guaranteed. However, the bid is still relatively low (only 4 out of a possible 48 digits), so challenging might be risky. I'll make a slightly higher bid of 4 9s, which is the next valid bid (same quantity but higher digit).

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 53807796, which contains no 9s. The current bid is 4 9s by Player 2. With 48 total digits across 6 players, it's possible that there are at least 4 9s in play, as each player has 8 digits. On average, each digit (0-9) would appear about 4.8 times across all hands. Since I have no 9s, the likelihood of 4 or more 9s existing in the remaining 40 digits is still reasonable (expected count of 9s is around 4). I don't feel confident enough to challenge yet. Instead, I will make a higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 5 7s feels like a safer move, increasing the quantity while switching to a digit I have some of in my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have two 7s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of this bid. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity and increase the digit. Bidding 5 8s is a valid next step and reasonable since the previous bids have focused on 8s and 9s. This bid is a conservative increase and keeps the game moving.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. I could bid 6 of any digit, or bid 5 of 9. I'll bid 6 0s, as 0 is a relatively uncommon digit, and I have one in my hand. It's a slightly safer bid than 5 9s, as another player bid 4 9s already.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have only one zero and expect about 4 zeros among the 40 unknown digits (Binomial mean=4), so the probability of at least 5 more zeros (total ≥6) is only ~37%. The bid of 6 zeros is unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits and each digit equally likely, the expected count of 2s among others is about 3.2, giving roughly an 84% chance of at least two more. Bidding 4 2s is a strong yet reasonable opening move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (60904565), I have zero 3s. Player 1 has bid 4 3s, which means they believe there are at least 4 threes among all players. With 5 players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. The expected number of any digit would be around 4 (40 total digits ÷ 10 possible digits). Since I have zero 3s in my hand, the other 4 players would need to have at least 4 threes between them, which is entirely possible. I could challenge, but it's a risky move at this early stage. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 4s, one 5, one 6, and one 9 in my hand. I'll bid 4 4s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value, which makes for a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 53807796, which contains one 4. The current bid is 4 4s by Player 2. With 5 players and 40 total digits, an average of 4 of each digit is expected across all hands. Since I only have one 4, it’s possible but not highly likely that there are at least 3 more 4s among the other 32 digits. However, bidding higher seems safer at this stage. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 5 7s feels reasonable, as it increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 4 4s. This bid aligns with my hand strength and the expected distribution of digits.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s, meaning at least five 7s exist among all players. I have two 7s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of this bid. To raise, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 5 and increase the digit. Since 7 is already high, increasing the digit to 8 at the same quantity is a valid move. Bidding 5 8s is a reasonable next step that challenges others to match or exceed this bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 5 8s by Player 4. To bid 6 8s I need 4 more 8s among the other 32 unknown digits. The probability of at least 4 successes in a Binomial(32,0.1) is about 40%, which exceeds the ~37% chance of winning a challenge on 5 8s. Therefore raising to 6 8s is the most favorable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge Player 1's bid of 7 8s. Looking at my hand (60904565), I have zero 8s. The current bid claims there are at least 7 eights among all 40 digits. That means the other players would need to have at least 7 eights among their 32 digits (8 digits × 4 players). While possible, this is getting quite high. The fact that multiple players have been bidding on 8s suggests there might be several in play, but 7 still seems high. Additionally, Player 0 bid 6 8s and Player 1 immediately raised to 7 8s, which could be a bluff. Given I have zero 8s in my hand, I think challenging is the better option here.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I'm starting this round as the first bidder. Looking at my hand (60904565), I have one 0, one 4, two 5s, one 6, and one 9. Since I have two 5s in my hand, that's a good digit to start with. With 4 players having 8 digits each (32 total digits), and assuming random distribution, each digit would appear about 3.2 times on average. Starting with a conservative bid of 3 5s seems reasonable based on my hand containing two 5s already.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 53807796, which contains one 5. The current bid by Player 2 is 3 5s across all 32 digits in play. Since I only have one 5, it means the other three players must collectively have at least two more 5s for the bid to hold. This seems plausible given that there are 24 digits I don't know about. I don't want to challenge yet as the bid isn't overly aggressive. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 3 7s feels safe and increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 7s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since the quantity is 3, I can bid 3 8s or 4 0s. I don't have any 8s or 0s in my hand, but bidding 3 8s is a small step up and might pressure the next player. Bidding 4 7s would be higher in quantity but I only have two 7s, so that might be risky. Therefore, bidding 3 8s is a reasonable and valid move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (60904565), I have zero 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, meaning Player 0 is claiming there are at least 3 nines among all players. Since I have none, those 3 nines would need to be distributed among the other 3 players. While this is possible, it means each other player would need to have exactly one 9 on average. From previous rounds, I've observed that Player 0 has made reasonable bids and even successfully challenged once. I could bid 4 0s since I have two 0s in my hand, but I think challenging is the better move here. The probability of exactly 3 nines existing seems lower than the probability of fewer than 3 nines.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 53807796, which contains one 8. The current bid by Player 0 is 3 8s across all 24 digits in play among the three active players. Since I only have one 8, the other two players must collectively have at least two 8s for the bid to hold. This is plausible given that each player has 8 digits, and it's early in the round with a low bid quantity. Challenging now seems risky as the bid is conservative. Instead, I will make a higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 4 7s feels reasonable as it increases the quantity while staying on a digit I have some strength in.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have two 7s in my hand (digits: 1,7,2,1,6,7,9,7), which supports the plausibility of the bid. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. The next higher bid after 4 7s could be 4 8s or 5 0s. Since I have one 8 in my hand, bidding 4 8s is reasonable and slightly safer than jumping to 5 0s, which is a bigger leap. Therefore, I will bid 4 8s.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and with eight unknown cards held by Player 3 there’s a reasonable chance (~53%) they have at least one more 8.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 53807796, which contains one 8. The current bid by Player 0 is 3 8s. With only 16 total digits remaining across both players, and knowing I have one 8, there must be at least two more 8s in Player 0's hand for the bid to hold. This is possible, but I can make a higher bid to push the game forward and test their confidence. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 4 7s feels safer as I already contribute half of the required count. This bid is higher than 3 8s since it increases the quantity.
