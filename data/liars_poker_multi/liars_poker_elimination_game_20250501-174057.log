Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made, I can start with a conservative bid based on the digits in my hand. I have one '5' and one '3', so bidding '2 5s' is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that at least one other player has a '5'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand (26456908). With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. The current bid is 2 5s, which is quite low and reasonable. Since I already have one 5, there only needs to be one more 5 among the other 40 digits held by other players, which is very likely. I could challenge, but it's too risky given the low bid. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding on 6s would leverage my knowledge. I'll bid 3 6s, which increases both the quantity and the digit value.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 6s and the current bid is 3 6s. With 40 unknown cards, the probability of at least two more 6s is over 90%, making a bid of 4 6s a safe raise.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s. Bidding 4 7s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Given that the average number of any digit across all hands is 4.8, 4 total 7s is plausible. This bid leverages my existing 7 to support the claim.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. Bidding 5 7s would be a blatant lie, and likely to be challenged. I could bid a lower digit with a higher quantity, but given the history of increasing bids, that might also be quickly challenged. I have two 8s, so bidding 5 8s is a reasonable bluff, increasing both the quantity and the digit. It's not an outrageous bid given the earlier bids of 4 6s and 4 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average number of any digit is 4.8. A bid of 5 8s is slightly above average, but not outrageously high given the bidding history has escalated quickly. I also have two 9s. Bidding 5 9s is a valid higher bid that uses the strength of my hand. Bidding 6 of any digit is also a valid higher bid, but with only one 8 myself, bidding 6 8s feels too risky. Bidding 5 9s is a safer option that leverages my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. With 48 total digits remaining and 6 players, it's plausible but risky that there are 5 9s. However, bidding higher on 9s is not feasible with my hand. I could bid 6 8s, as I have one 8 and it's likely there are at least 5 more 8s among the other players. Alternatively, I could challenge the current bid of 5 9s, as it's somewhat risky. Given the slight risk, I'll opt to bid 6 8s to maintain a safer play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The current bid is '6 8s' made by Player 0. Looking at my hand (26456908), I have one 8. Since there are 6 active players with 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For the bid of '6 8s' to be valid, there need to be at least 6 eights among all players. I already have 1, so there would need to be 5 more among the other players. This is possible but not guaranteed. Player 4 previously bid '5 8s', suggesting they might have some 8s. I could either challenge or make a higher bid. If I make a higher bid, I could bid '6 9s' (same quantity, higher digit) or '7 0s' (higher quantity). Looking at my hand, I have one 9, which gives me some confidence in bidding '6 9s'. However, Player 5 already bid '5 9s', suggesting they might have multiple 9s. Given this, I'll bid '7 0s' since I have one 0 in my hand, and it's a safer bet than challenging or bidding on 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, so there are 40 unknown digits. With p=0.1 for each digit, I expect about 4 zeros among them. Needing 6 or more zeros in the unknowns to satisfy a bid of 7 zeros is unlikely (~21% chance), making Player 1â€™s bid of 7 zeros improbable. I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With 5 players (40 digits), we expect about 4 sixes total. Bidding 4 6s means just two of the remaining 32 digits must be sixes, which has roughly an 84% chance, making this a reasonable opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand contains one 6 and one 7. Bidding 4 7s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Since I hold one 7, it's plausible there are at least four 7s across all hands. Challenging 4 6s carries risk as the expected total for any digit in 40 digits is 4, making the bid statistically neutral. A cautious bid on 7s leverages my existing 7 and pressures opponents to either raise or challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 7s is necessary. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit to 8 would require me to bid 4 8s, which is plausible given I have one 8. Increasing the quantity to 5 7s is also plausible. However, given the previous rounds and the elimination of Player 1 for overbidding on 0s, it's safer to bid a slightly higher quantity with the same digit. Therefore, bidding 5 7s seems like a reasonable move.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 5 7s. With 5 players and 40 digits total, the average count for any digit is 4. I have two 9s, which is above average for me. Bidding 5 9s is a reasonable increase over 5 7s, leveraging the strength of my hand in 9s.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, which makes this bid somewhat likely but not guaranteed. With 40 digits remaining and 5 players, it's possible but risky. I have one 6 in my hand, and previous bids suggest that higher quantities of lower digits have been successful. Bidding 6 6s increases the quantity and uses a digit I have, making it a reasonable and strategic move.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. There are 32 unknown digits, so I expect about 3.2 more 6s (32Ã—0.1), for a total of around 5.2. The probability of at least six 6s is under 50%, making the claim of 6 6s unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand, so there need to be at least three 6s in the remaining 24 digits of the other three players. The expected number of 6s in 24 digits is 2.4, making the bid of 4 6s slightly above average. Historical challenges against similar bids (e.g., 6 6s) have succeeded when actual counts were lower. With a ~56% probability that the total 6s are fewer than 4, challenging is statistically favorable.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 4 6s increases the quantity and is a reasonable bid, given my hand. Bidding a higher digit with the same quantity would be 3 7s, but I only have one 7. Bidding 3 7s would be a lie and potentially risky.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 6 and two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s. With 24 total digits and 3 players, the average count for any digit is 2.4. A bid of 4 6s is slightly above average. I have one 6, so the other two players would need three more 6s combined for the bid to be true. This is possible but not guaranteed. I have two 9s, and bidding on 9s seems like a stronger move based on my hand. I will bid 5 9s, which is a higher quantity than the current bid and aligns with my hand strength.
