Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 7s' by Player 0, I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. My hand is 89142066, which does not contain any 7s. However, it does contain two 6s. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 players, each having 8 digits, the bid of '3 7s' seems plausible but not extremely high. To make a higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since my hand lacks 7s but has 6s, and given that bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity is a valid move, I could consider bidding on a digit higher than 7 if I had enough information or digits to support such a bid. However, given the information and my hand, a safer approach might be to challenge the bid if it seems unlikely or to bid on a digit I have more information about. But, since I don't have 7s and don't want to bid blindly on a higher digit without sufficient evidence from my hand, and considering the current bid is not extremely high, making a bid that increases either the quantity or the digit seems like a strategic move. Given these considerations and the fact that I have two 6s, which is a significant portion of my hand but not directly useful for challenging the '3 7s' bid, I should look for a digit that I can reasonably bid on. The presence of two 6s in my hand suggests that bidding on 6s could be a good strategy if I were to increase the quantity. However, the current bid is on 7s, so I must decide whether to challenge based on the likelihood of the bid being true or to make a new bid that is higher in either quantity or digit. Since my hand does not directly support bidding on 7s or higher without more information, and challenging seems risky without more insight into other players' hands, I must weigh the options carefully. Given that I do not have enough information to confidently challenge the bid of '3 7s' and that my hand does contain digits that could support a bid on a different digit, I should consider what would be a reasonable next bid. Considering all players have 8 digits and there are 48 digits in total, bidding on a digit I have more of could be strategic. But, since the current bid is '3 7s', and I don't have 7s, my best option is to either challenge if I think '3 7s' is unlikely or make a bid that is higher in the sequence of bids. Since challenging directly requires more certainty about the bid's validity, and given that my hand does not provide strong evidence against '3 7s', I should focus on making a strategic bid. Given these considerations, making a bid on a higher digit or increasing the quantity while considering the digits I have seems prudent. But, without direct evidence or a strong hunch about the distribution of digits among other players, any bid I make must be cautiously considered. Thus, my action should balance the risk of challenging an uncertain bid with the strategic opportunity of making a higher bid that could potentially be supported by the distribution of digits across all players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 1. I have two 6s and four 4s and other digits in my hand (16768454). The presence of two 6s in my hand supports the bid slightly, but I need to consider the total count across all players. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 6s seems plausible because I know I have two 6s, and it's likely others have some as well. However, I should also consider the total number of digits remaining (48) and the fact that there are 5 other players. Bidding 4 7s is another option, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit. I will choose to bid 4 7s as it is a safer option given the information I have.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand, making the current bid of 4 7s potentially achievable if at least one other player holds a 7. Given the expected average of 4.8 total 7s across all players, challenging would likely eliminate me. Bidding 4 9s is strategic since I hold one 9, and the average distribution suggests four 9s could exist across all players, making this bid plausible.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, and I only hold one 9, making a challenge (~22% win chance) too risky. I have two 8s in my hand and across 48 digits we’d expect about 4.8 eights total. To reach a bid of 5 8s I need just three more among the other 40 unknown digits, which has roughly a 78% chance. Since I can’t raise the digit at quantity 4, I’ll increase the quantity to 5 on a digit I hold, making 5 8s a strong, plausible bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid of 5 8s means there need to be at least 4 more 8s among the other 5 players (40 digits). While possible, this seems unlikely given the progression of bids and that no one else has shown strong confidence in 8s earlier. The previous bids were relatively conservative (4 of various digits) before this jump to 5 8s. Given my knowledge of having just one 8, and that 5 8s would require a relatively high concentration of 8s among remaining players, challenging seems safer than making a higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand and with 32 unknown digits the expected number of 8s is about 3.2, giving a total expectation of ~5.2. Bidding 4 8s has a high probability (~76%) of being true and forces the next player to raise to either 4 9s or 5 of any digit, constraining their options.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, which is a safe increase in quantity. Or, I could challenge if I think the other players are unlikely to have many 8s. Given that the total digits remaining is 40, and the current bid is only 4, it is not unreasonable that there are at least four 8s in total. Therefore, I will make a slightly higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 5 0s and considering my hand has one 0, I need to assess the likelihood of this bid being true. Since there are 40 digits in total and each player has 8 digits, the maximum number of 0s any single player can have is 8. The bid of 5 0s seems plausible but not excessively high given the total number of digits. However, I must consider that I have only one 0 in my hand, and without knowledge of other players' hands, it's difficult to accurately assess the total number of 0s. Considering the bidding history, players have been bidding on higher digits, which might indicate a lower number of 0s. Given this uncertainty and the fact that bidding higher than 5 0s requires either bidding a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit, I should look for a reasonable increase. Since my hand contains two 6s, and previous bids have included 6s and higher digits, bidding on a higher digit seems more reasonable than challenging the current bid of 5 0s directly.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have the hand 16768454, which contains two 1s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since there are 40 total digits and 5 players, a bid of 5 1s suggests that the total count of 1s is at least 5. I have 2 ones, so the remaining 3 ones are distributed among the other players. Increasing the quantity to 6 seems plausible if I assume the other players have a reasonable number of the next higher digit. I will bid 5 2s, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. The current bid is 5 2s. Bidding 5 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages my strong holding in 7s, which increases the likelihood of meeting or exceeding the bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I hold two 8s. To bid 5 8s I need only three more 8s among the other 32 cards. The probability of ≥3 successes in Binomial(32,0.1) is about 63%, which is better odds than challenging the current 5 7s (≈60% chance of success). Bidding 5 8s is the next legal bid (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 6 0s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since my hand contains two 6s, and considering the bidding history where players have bid on various digits, I should look for an opportunity to increase either the quantity or the digit. Given that I have two 6s and no other digit appears more than twice in my hand, bidding on 6s seems like a reasonable choice. However, I must increase the quantity since the current bid is on 0s and I cannot decrease the digit. Therefore, bidding 7 6s could be a strategic move, considering my hand and the need to make a higher bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (16768454). The total count of 6s across all players must be at least 2 (mine) + other players'. With 3 other players and 8 digits each, it's plausible that there are at least 5 more 6s. However, bidding higher quantity or same quantity with a higher digit is required. I can either bid a higher quantity of 6s or keep the quantity and bid a higher digit. Given my hand doesn't have a high count of 6s, I should be cautious. Bidding 8 6s might be too aggressive. However, bidding 7 7s is a reasonable step as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit. I will choose to bid 7 7s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have four 7s in my hand. The current bid of 7 7s requires at least seven 7s in total. Given that the expected number of 7s in the remaining digits is around 3.2 (based on binomial distribution), the total expected count is approximately 7.2, making the bid slightly more likely to be correct. Challenging would have a ~37% success rate, which is risky. Instead, I place a higher bid on 8s, a higher digit with the same quantity, to escalate the bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 0s and my hand 89142066, I notice I have one 0. Considering the total digits remaining are 32 and there are 4 players, each with 8 digits, the maximum number of any digit could be 32 if all players had the same digit, which is highly unlikely. Since I only have one 0 and the bid is for 5 0s, which seems achievable given the number of players and digits, but not excessively high, I should consider challenging this bid. However, given that the previous challenge in the game history showed a bid of 5 8s being correct and the current total digits are exactly 32, it's possible that there could indeed be 5 zeros among the players. My hand does not provide strong evidence against the bid of 5 0s, so I must weigh the risk of challenging versus bidding higher. Since bidding higher than 5 0s requires either bidding a higher quantity of the same digit (which would be 6 0s) or the same quantity of a higher digit, and considering the digits in my hand, I could bid on a digit I have in higher quantity or a higher digit. I have two 6s, which could be a good basis for a bid, considering the game's history and the fact that we are now down to 4 players, making higher bids on specific digits more plausible due to the reduced pool of digits. Bidding 6 0s might be too risky without more zeros in my hand, but I could consider bidding on a digit I have more of, like the 6s. However, the current bid is on zeros, and moving to a different digit requires strategic consideration of what others might have. Given my hand and the need to bid higher, I should look for a balance between the quantity and the digit that is reasonable and not overly risky. Since I have two 6s and the game history shows bids on various digits, I could consider increasing the quantity or moving to a higher digit. The safest increase from 5 0s, considering my hand and the goal to bid higher, would be to either increase the quantity of zeros, which I'm not confident in due to my hand, or move to a higher digit with the same quantity, which could be risky without knowing others' hands. Given these considerations and the fact that I need to make a strategic decision based on the information available, I decide to bid on a digit I have in my hand, considering the game's progression and the bids made so far.

Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 0s and considering my hand 89142066, which contains no zeros, I must decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Since the total digits remaining are 24 and we have 3 active players, each with 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 24. The bid of 4 0s seems plausible but not extremely high given the total possible count. However, without any zeros in my hand, I have to rely on the probability of zeros being present in other players' hands. Given that the previous bids and challenges have not revealed a significant number of zeros, and considering the game's progression, bidding higher might be risky. Challenging the bid of 4 0s could be a strategic move, especially since I don't have any zeros and the previous bids haven't shown a high count of zeros. It's a gamble based on the probability of zeros in the other players' hands.

Given the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and I have two 6s, bidding 2 6s seems like a safe and reasonable start, as it does not overcommit and leaves room for escalation or challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have zero 6s in my hand, so all 2 required sixes must be in Player 1’s hand of 8 digits. The chance of them holding at least two 6s is only about 19%, so it’s very likely the bid is false. I should challenge.
