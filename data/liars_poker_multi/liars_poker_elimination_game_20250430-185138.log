Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. With 40 unknown digits among the five other players, I’d expect on average 4 more 7s (10% frequency), giving an expected total of about 6 7s. Even to reach 4 7s requires only 2 more among them, which has over a 90% chance. Bidding 4 7s is a safe opening and restricts same-quantity raises to only two higher digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have 3 7s in my hand, which makes me think the bid is plausible. I'll try to bid higher by increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, which gives me some confidence in the digit. The current bid of 5 7s is slightly above the expected average of 4.8 for any digit, making it a marginal challenge risk. Bidding 6 0s leverages my zeros and increases the quantity, which is statistically plausible given the average distribution.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 6 0s. Since I only have one 0, it is unlikely that there are 6 0s in total. I should challenge the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The last round ended with a challenge to 6 0s, revealing only 5 0s. This suggests that 0s are less common. I have one 0, one 6, and two 7s in my hand. Given the previous bids of 4 7s and 5 7s, I should bid higher than 5 7s. Bidding 7 6s increases the digit and slightly increases the quantity, leveraging my hand and the game history.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s made by Player 4. I have 8 digits in my hand: 3, 1, 9, 4, 2, 5, 1, 9. I see that I have one 7 in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 40 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. The current bid of 7 7s seems high but not impossible. However, I do not have enough information about other players' hands. I will increase the quantity to try and win. I have two 1s, so bidding on 1s could be strategic, but increasing the digit seems more straightforward. I will bid 8 1s as my quantity and digit are reasonable given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 1s in my hand, and among the other 32 unknown digits the chance of there being at least eight 1s is extremely low (around 1%). Therefore I should challenge the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand and expect about 2.4 more among the 24 unknown cards. The probability of at least two of those showing up (for a total of 4) is around 70%, so bidding 4 7s is a reasonable opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s, and I have a 7 in my hand. Given the relatively low total digits remaining, I should increase the quantity or digit to make a more competitive bid. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 4 9s seems like a reasonable increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. With only 32 total digits remaining and four players, it's unlikely that there are 4 9s in total. Challenging seems like a good move, but if I must bid, I have two 8s in my hand, so I could bid 5 8s, which is a reasonable increase in digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 0s in my hand, so there must be at least two 0s among the 24 digits. The current bid is “1 0s”, so increasing to “2 0s” is a valid higher bid and is guaranteed to be true, making it unchallengeable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no '1's in my hand. There are 16 unknown digits among the other players, with an expected 1.6 '1's and only about a 22% chance of three or more. A bid of 3 1s is unlikely, so I should challenge.
