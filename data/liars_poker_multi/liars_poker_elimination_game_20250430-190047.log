Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 0s. Since there's no current bid, I can start with a bid that reflects my hand's composition. Bidding 2 0s is a safe and accurate starting point.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, but the expected number of 0s across all 48 digits is ~4.8, making Player 0's bid of 2 0s very likely to be true. Challenging would be risky. Since I have two 1s in my hand, bidding 2 1s (same quantity but higher digit) is a logical next step to raise the bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand, so there are guaranteed to be at least three 0s across all players. The current bid is 2 1s, so I must raise. Bidding 3 0s increases the quantity and is certain based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. With 48 total digits among 6 players, this is a relatively low bid, close to the expected average count of 4.8 for any digit. My hand contains one of every digit. Challenging at this stage is risky as 3 0s is quite plausible. Bidding 3 1s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is well supported by my hand, as I have one 1 and only need two more 1s from the remaining 40 digits among other players, which is likely.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand, so the current bid of 3 1s is plausible, but not high enough to challenge. Looking at my hand, I have three 9s, which is the highest count of any digit I possess. The current bid is 3 1s, so I can either raise the digit to 3 2s or higher, or increase the quantity. Since I have three 9s, bidding 3 9s is a safe, legal, and strong move, as it's less likely to be challenged early and is supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 47775869, which contains no 9s. The current bid is 3 9s by Player 4. Since there are 48 total digits across all players, and I have 8 digits with no 9s, there are 40 digits remaining among the other players. A bid of 3 9s is plausible as it represents a small fraction of the total digits, and I have no information to suggest it's unlikely. Therefore, I will make a higher bid rather than challenge. I have three 7s in my hand, which is a strong count for a single digit. Bidding 4 7s increases the quantity and changes the digit, making it a reasonable escalation based on my hand strength.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand contains a 9, which is a higher digit than 7. Bidding 4 9s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, making it a valid and strategic move based on my available digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid of 4 9s is slightly below the expected average of 4.8 9s across all 48 digits, making it likely valid. Challenging would be risky. Instead, I should raise the bid. With two 5s in my hand, bidding 5 5s is reasonable, as the expected total number of 5s (4.8) is close to 5, and my hand provides some support for this bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. With 40 unknown digits, the expected number of additional 7s is about 4, giving an expected total of around 6 sevens. That makes at least five 7s quite likely (~78%), so it’s safe to raise to 5 7s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s, which is slightly above the average expected count (4.8) across 48 digits. Challenging this bid is risky as it's plausible. My hand contains one 8. Bidding 5 8s requires 4 more 8s from the remaining 40 digits held by other players. The expected number of 8s among 40 digits is 4 (40 * 0.1). Therefore, bidding 5 8s is a reasonable and plausible step up from 5 7s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. In my hand (39940248), I have one 8. With 48 digits in play and five other players, the expected average per digit is about 4.8. Bidding 5 9s is reasonable since I have two 9s, and 9 is a high digit that has already been bid on and survived. This increases the digit and keeps the quantity the same, which is a valid next bid.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:4 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s made by Player 4. In my hand, I have only one 9 out of my 8 digits. With 6 active players and a total of 48 digits, the bid of 5 9s means that there need to be at least 4 more 9s in the other players' hands. Given that 9 is just one of ten possible digits, the average expected count for any digit is about 4.8 across all hands. While 5 9s is close to this average and plausible, I can make a slightly higher bid to test the waters. I have three 7s in my hand, which is a strong count for that digit. Bidding 6 7s increases the quantity and leverages my strong holding in 7s, which I believe has a reasonable chance of being accurate or at least not easily challenged. I will avoid challenging for now since 5 9s is not outrageously high.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. My hand contains no 7s, and with 48 total digits across all players, the likelihood of at least 6 7s existing is uncertain. Previous bids have escalated, but without evidence of multiple 7s in others' hands, challenging the bid is a strategic move to test its validity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round with no current bid to beat, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand is 47775869, which contains three 7s. Since there are 40 total digits across 5 players, I estimate that there could be more 7s in other players' hands. Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable starting point, as it reflects a slight increase over my own count and is plausible given the total digits. This bid also leverages my strong holding in 7s while keeping the quantity low enough to avoid immediate challenges.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s, which requires at least 4 sevens in total. Since I have no 7s, challenging would risk elimination if the bid is correct. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages my existing 9, making it plausible if others have 2-3 9s combined.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I only have one 9, so challenging now wins only if there are fewer than three 9s among the other 32 cards (≈37% chance), which is too risky. I hold three 0s, so bidding 5 zeros requires just two more zeros among the 32 unknown digits. That has a high probability (≈84%), making “5 0s” a safe and valid increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. There are 5 players remaining with 8 digits each, totaling 40 digits. The expected average count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. The bid of 5 0s is slightly above this average. My hand contains one 0. For the bid to be true, the other 4 players must collectively hold at least 4 0s among their 32 digits. Based on probability (Binomial distribution B(32, 0.1)), the chance of getting 4 or more 0s from 32 random digits is approximately 39%. This means there is about a 61% chance that the other players hold less than 4 0s, resulting in a total count of less than 5. Challenging the bid has a statistically favorable outcome.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 39940248, which contains two 0s. The current bid is 4 0s. With 32 digits in play and 8 in my hand, it's reasonable to expect that there could be at least 4 zeros among all hands, especially since I hold two myself. Challenging now would be risky. The next valid bid must be 4 1s or 5 of any digit. I have two 9s, which is a strong showing. Based on previous rounds, bids on 9s have been competitive. Therefore, bidding 4 9s is a safe and valid increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 4. In my hand, I have one 9, which means I contribute only 1 to the total count of 9s. With 32 total digits across 4 players, the maximum possible number of 9s is 32, but it's unlikely that the remaining 24 digits from the other 3 players contain 3 more 9s to meet the bid of 4. However, considering the bidding history, Player 4 has consistently bid on 9s, which might indicate they have a few in their hand. Still, the probability of exactly 4 or more 9s seems low, but not impossible. I could challenge, but it's risky as the count might just meet the bid. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid of 5 0s, as it increases the quantity and changes the digit, which is a safer move. I have no 0s in my hand, but the bid history shows some interest in 0s, so it might be plausible.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid of 5 0s by Player 5 is risky to challenge given their history of accurate bids (e.g., previous 6 7s bid was exact). I hold no 0s, so the 5 0s bid relies entirely on the other three players' hands. My hand contains two 1s, two 2s, and two 5s, making 5 1s a plausible bid to escalate the round. This bid follows the rule of same quantity but higher digit (1 > 0), maintaining game progression while leveraging my hand's strength.

However, 4 is not an unreasonable bid at this stage, so challenging now is risky. I also have two 9s in my hand, making a bid of 4 9s (same quantity, higher digit) a strong play, as I have half the needed 9s myself. This keeps pressure on the other players and is a safe, legal raise.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 47775869, which contains no 9s. The current bid is 4 9s by Player 4. With only 24 total digits across three players, and knowing I have zero 9s, the bid of 4 9s means that the other two players would need to have at least 4 9s between them (out of their 16 digits). This seems plausible but not overly likely, as it requires a relatively high concentration of 9s in their hands. However, since it's only 4 9s, it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I have three 7s in my hand, so bidding 5 0s feels like a reasonable escalation, as it increases the quantity and changes the digit to a neutral one where I have no information but the total count is still within a believable range.
