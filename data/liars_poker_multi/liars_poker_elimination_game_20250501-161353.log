Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. It's the first round, and there are 48 digits remaining. I should make a bid to establish a baseline. Bidding 3 9s seems reasonable, as it's a common digit and a moderate quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand is 60191152, which contains one 9. This means there are at least 5 9s in total (one in my hand and potentially four in the other hands). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have information about my own hand, I can analyze the likelihood of certain digits. I have one 1 and one 6 and other digits but no other 9s. Bidding 3 0s or any other 3 [digit]s where [digit] > 9 is not possible because there's no digit higher than 9, and bidding 3 [digit]s where [digit] < 9 is not higher. So, I need to increase the quantity. Bidding 4 9s seems reasonable because it's a small increase in quantity and directly relates to the current bid.

Player 1 bids: 4 9s

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:0 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 9s' by Player 1, I must decide whether to bid higher or challenge. My hand contains the digits 25641649. Since I don't have any 9s in my hand, I have to consider the likelihood of there being at least 4 nines among all players. With 48 total digits and 8 digits per player, the maximum number of any single digit is capped at 48, but given the diversity of digits in a typical distribution, bidding higher than '4 9s' requires careful consideration. To bid higher, I could either increase the quantity of the same digit (which would be '5 9s') or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit (which is not possible since 9 is the highest digit). Considering the distribution and the fact that I have no 9s, challenging seems like a viable option, especially since the next possible bid ('5 9s') seems risky without knowing the distribution of 9s among other players. However, I must consider the potential presence of 9s in other players' hands, which could make '4 9s' a plausible bid. Given these considerations and without specific knowledge of other players' hands, making a decision involves weighing the risk of challenging versus the risk of making an unsustainable bid. Since I have no 9s and considering the total number of digits, I lean towards challenging the current bid as it seems unlikely that there would be exactly 4 or more 9s given the random distribution of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None' as it's the start of the round and I am Player 1. I have to make the first bid. My hand is 60191152, which contains two 9s and one 1. A reasonable starting bid could be on a digit I have, so bidding on 9s seems sensible. Starting with a low quantity like 3 or 4 is prudent. I choose to bid 4 9s as it reflects my hand and is a conservative start.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. My hand contains no 9s, but others might. Bidding 5 9s increases the quantity, which is the only valid way to challenge the current bid. Since the total digits remaining are 40, it's plausible there are at least 5 9s across all players. This bid maintains pressure without risking an immediate challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Since only 40 digits are remaining, it's more likely that the bid is an overestimate. I will challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains two 3s. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid based on my own digits. Bidding 2 3s is a logical first move, as it reflects the quantity of a digit I hold and sets a baseline for further bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. Bidding 3 4s is a legal raise (quantity from 2 to 3) and is guaranteed correct since I already hold three 4s, making any challenge impossible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 3 and two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s, so I can make a higher bid with the same digit, or a higher bid with a different digit. Since I have two 4s, I can make a higher bid with the same digit, increasing the quantity to 4.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I need to bid higher than this. My hand is 60191152, which contains one 4. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since there are 32 total digits and the current bid is 4 4s, bidding 4 5s or 5 4s could be reasonable. Given that I have one 4 and there's a possibility others have more, increasing the quantity to 5 4s seems plausible. Alternatively, bidding 4 5s is also a viable option as it increases the digit. I'll choose to bid 4 5s as it's a safer increase in digit rather than quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains a 6, and the current bid is 4 5s. Bidding 4 6s is a valid higher bid since it maintains the same quantity (4) but increases the digit (5 to 6). This leverages my known card and follows the rules for increasing bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, so all 4 sixes must be in the other 24 cards. The probability of at least 4 sixes among 24 cards (with p=0.1) is only about 21.5%, making the bid unlikely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I hold three 4s in my hand. With 24 total digits, the average count per digit is about 2.4, and since I already have 3, a bid of 3 4s is guaranteed by my own cards and reasonably backed by the unknown cards. It’s a safe opening move that uses my strong holding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have 2 4s in my hand. I could bid 4 4s, but that's the same quantity. I could bid 3 5s, but that's the same digit. I could bid 3 6s, but that's not a good use of my hand. I could bid 4 5s, but that's not a good use of my hand. Therefore, I will bid 4 5s, increasing the quantity and digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have the hand 60191152, which contains one 5. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. My hand has two 6s and one 9, but since the total count of 6s and 9s across all hands is unknown, I need to make an educated guess. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit. However, considering the total digits remaining (24) and that there are already 4 5s bid, bidding 5 5s could be a safer option as it doesn't overcommit on a higher digit. I'll choose to bid 5 5s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have only one 5 in my hand. To meet a bid of 5 5s, the other 16 unknown digits would need at least four more 5s. The probability of that is under 10%, making the current bid highly unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. Player 0’s bid of 4 4s requires only one more 4 from their eight cards, which has about a 57% chance of being true. Challenging gives me a ~43% win chance. Any higher bid would be an almost certain bluff and get challenged, giving me an even lower chance. Therefore I should challenge.
