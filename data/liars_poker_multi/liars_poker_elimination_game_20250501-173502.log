Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since I'm the first bidder, I need to make an initial bid based on my hand. Looking at my hand (41690639), I have one 1, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 9, and two 0s. The most frequent digit in my hand is 0, which appears twice. A conservative starting bid would be to claim there are at least 5 zeros among all players. This is reasonable because I already have 2 zeros, and with 5 other players having 8 digits each, it's very likely that at least 3 more zeros exist among their 40 remaining digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 0s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have one 0 in my hand, I know that the total count of 0s is at least 1. However, bidding on 0s may not be the best strategy as it's already been bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s and other digits. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 players, the average number of any digit should be around 8 (48/6). Given this, bidding on a digit like 5, which I have two of, seems reasonable. Increasing the quantity to 6 (which is higher than the current bid of 5) while keeping the digit the same as a starting point could be a good strategy, but since I don't have enough information about other players' hands, I should consider the likelihood of my bid being valid. Given that I have two 5s and assuming an even distribution, it's plausible that there could be at least 6 5s among all players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Bidding 7 5s is possible, but risky. Bidding 6 6s is also possible, as I have a 6 in my hand. However, bidding 7 0s seems more reasonable as the previous bid was 5 0s and I have no information suggesting a high count of 5s. It's a small increase in quantity, making it less likely to be a bluff and potentially forcing Player 1 to overextend if they are bluffing.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s made by Player 2. I have 8 secret digits in my hand: 57749742. I count two 0s in my hand. Given that there are 6 active players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 48 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. The bid of 7 0s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. I have two 7s in my hand, and bidding on 7s could be strategic. However, I must make a bid that is strictly higher than 7 0s. Bidding 8 7s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit value compared to the current bid of 7 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 7s. With 48 total digits, the average number of 7s is 4.8, making 8 7s unlikely. My hand has no 7s, and challenging this high bid could expose a bluff. The probability of the actual count being less than 8 is significant, so challenging is strategic.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains two 0s. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid that reflects my hand's composition. Bidding 2 0s is a logical first move, as it directly corresponds to the count of 0s I hold. This sets a baseline for the round while remaining cautious.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (41690639), I have 1 zero. Player 5 has bid 3 zeros total across all players. With 5 active players and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. If I have 1 zero, then the other 4 players would need to have at least 2 more zeros among them for the bid to be valid. This seems quite reasonable. I can either make a higher bid or accept this one. Since zeros are relatively common and I have other digits I could bid on, I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have 1 one, 1 three, 1 four, 1 six, 1 nine, and 2 sixes. I could bid on sixes since I have 2 of them, but I'll play it safe and just increase the current bid to 4 zeros, which should still be reasonable given the total number of digits in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 0s' and my hand containing '54659710', I notice I have one '0' and also several other digits. Since the bid is on '0s' and I only have one, I need to consider if bidding higher is reasonable or if challenging is a better option. With 40 total digits remaining and 5 players, the maximum number of any digit is capped. Considering my hand and the fact that '0' is not very frequent in my hand, and given that the previous round had a challenge on '8 7s' which was unsuccessful for the bidder, indicating players might be overestimating, I should consider the likelihood of there being at least 4 '0s' in the total pool. Given that I only have one '0', and without more information on other players' hands, it seems somewhat unlikely that there are 4 or more '0s' in total. However, the bid is not extremely high, so I must weigh the risk of challenging versus bidding higher. Since I have to bid higher than '4 0s', my options are limited. I could bid on a higher quantity of '0s', which seems risky given my hand, or bid on the same quantity but a higher digit. Given the digits in my hand, bidding on '5s' seems more promising because I have two '5s' and '7s' and other digits, but the current bid is on '0s', and switching to '5s' would require a higher quantity bid to be considered higher than '4 0s'. Considering all factors, my best move, given the need to make a strategic decision with limited information, is to challenge the current bid of '4 0s' because it seems risky to bid higher without more confidence in the distribution of digits across all players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding in this new round. Looking at my hand (41690639), I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 9, and no 2s, 5s, 7s, or 8s. Since I'm making the first bid, I should choose a digit I have at least one of to increase my chances. From my previous rounds, I know 0s were common (there were 5 in the last round with 5 players). I have one 0 in my hand, so bidding on 0s is reasonable. With 4 players having 8 digits each (32 total), a conservative starting bid would be around 3-4 of a digit. I'll start with 3 0s, which is reasonable given I already have one in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. The previous rounds showed a willingness to bid 0s, and with only 32 total digits remaining, 3 0s is plausible, but not extremely high. I can increase the quantity to 4 0s, which is a valid bid. Alternatively, I could challenge, but given the history of successful 0s bids, challenging seems risky. Increasing the quantity is a safer option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have two 0s in my hand, but the total count of 0s across all players could be as low as 2 (if others have none). Since the bid requires at least 4, challenging risks exposing a potential bluff. However, without knowing others' hands, it's uncertain. Alternatively, bidding higher (e.g., 5 0s or 4 1s) could be risky. Challenging is a strategic move to test the validity of the bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (41690639), I have 0 zeros. The current bid is 2 0s made by Player 5, and Player 2 previously bid 1 0s. Since I have no zeros in my hand, there must be at least 2 zeros between Player 2 and Player 5 for the current bid to be valid. With 8 digits per player and 3 players total, there could be up to 24 digits in play. I can either raise the bid or challenge. Since I don't have any zeros, I'm slightly skeptical about there being many zeros in total, but 2 zeros across two players is quite reasonable. I'll make a conservative bid by increasing the digit rather than the quantity, moving to 2 1s. I have one 1 in my hand, so I'm contributing to this bid myself.

Bidding 3 2s, 3 4s, 3 5s, 3 6s, 3 7s, 3 8s, or 3 9s would all be valid bids. Since I have a 1, increasing the quantity of 1s seems like a safe play. I will bid 3 1s.

Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (41690639), I have one 1. The current bid is 4 1s, meaning Player 5 claims there are at least 4 ones across all players' hands. Since I have 1 one, there would need to be at least 3 more ones between Player 2 and Player 5 for this bid to be valid. This is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's risky since the bid is reasonable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, which gives me some confidence. I could bid 4 2s (same quantity, higher digit) or 5 1s (higher quantity, same digit). Since I only know about my one 1, bidding 5 1s seems risky. I'll go with 4 3s - same quantity but higher digit than 1s.
