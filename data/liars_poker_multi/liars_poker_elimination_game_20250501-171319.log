Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to start the bidding (Current Bid: None). I must make a bid. My hand is 48613447, containing three 4s, which is my most frequent digit. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total digits), the expected average count for any digit is 4.8. Since I hold three 4s, bidding '4 4s' is a safe and statistically sound opening bid. It leverages my hand's strength while being close to the expected average, requiring only one more 4 among the other 40 digits held by the other players.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains three 1s and no 4s. The current bid is 4 4s, which could be plausible if other players have 4s. However, bidding 5 1s leverages my three 1s and increases the quantity, making it a safer and higher bid than challenging with uncertain outcomes.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I hold two 4s, and Player 0 previously bid 4 4s, indicating they probably have several 4s as well. Given 48 total digits, it is quite likely that there are at least five 4s in play. By keeping the quantity at 5 and raising the digit from 1 to 4, I make a higher, defensible bid supported by both my hand and the bidding history.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 5 4s, which means there needs to be at least four more 4s among the other five players (since I have one). With five players left, it's possible but risky. I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding 6 4s seems too high, and bidding on a higher digit like 5s or 6s would require a higher quantity. Given the uncertainty, I choose to challenge the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I can see two 4s in my hand. With 40 digits in play, the average count for any particular digit is about 4. Since I already hold half of that, it is highly probable that at least two more 4s are among the 32 unknown digits. Opening with 4 4s is a safe, conservative bid that leaves plenty of room to raise later if needed.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. To beat the current bid of 4 4s I can keep the quantity the same and raise the digit. With 32 unknown digits in the other players’ hands, the expected number of additional 6s is about 3.2, so the chance that there are at least two more 6s is high. This makes a total of at least four 6s quite plausible, while also putting pressure on the next players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 4's bid of 4 6s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (78420931), I have zero 6s. With 5 active players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits in play. For there to be at least 4 sixes, the other 4 players would need to have an average of 1 six each, which is reasonable. Given that I don't have any 6s myself, and Player 4 confidently bid 4 6s (suggesting they likely have at least 1-2 sixes), I'll make a higher bid. I'll increase to 5 6s, betting that there are more 6s than the minimum bid, or switch to a higher digit. Based on my hand, I have two 7s, one 8, and one 9, so bidding on 7s seems reasonable. I'll bid 5 7s, increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (48613447). For the bid to be true, there need to be at least four more 7s among the other 32 digits (4 players * 8 digits). The expected number of 7s across all 40 digits is 4, so 5 is slightly above average, making a challenge plausible but not certain. However, I have three 4s in my hand. Bidding on 4s leverages my hand strength. A bid must be higher than 5 7s. Possible higher bids include 5 8s, 5 9s, or increasing the quantity to 6. Bidding 6 4s requires only three more 4s among the other 32 digits. Given that I have three 4s, and the previous round showed a high count of 4s (7 out of 48), bidding 6 4s seems like a strong, justifiable bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. My hand contains no 4s, so the total 4s would be from the other four players' 32 digits. The expected number of 4s is 3.2, making 6 4s unlikely. Challenging this bid offers a reasonable chance to win if the count is less than 6, while the risk of elimination is balanced by the potential for a higher-probability outcome.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round with 4 active players (32 total digits), I need to make an opening bid. My hand is 48613447, which contains three 4s. The expected number of any digit is 32/10 = 3.2. Having three 4s gives me a strong starting point for this digit. The estimated total number of 4s across all hands is around 3 (my hand) + (24 other digits / 10) = 5.4. Bidding '4 4s' is a reasonable opening bid, as it leverages my hand's strength and requires only one additional 4 among the other 24 digits held by the opponents, which is statistically likely. This bid is also consistent with successful opening bids in previous rounds.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I already see 2 fours, so the bid of 4 4s is very likely to be valid; challenging would be risky. I also hold 2 fives, so bidding 4 5s only requires at least two more 5s among the 24 unknown digits, which has a solid probability (~70%). Raising the digit while keeping the quantity is the minimal legal increase and puts pressure on the next players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have only one 5, so challenging is not attractive—four 5s among 32 digits is quite plausible. I do, however, hold two 6s. By moving to 4 6s I legally raise the bid (same quantity, higher digit). With two of the four 6s already in my hand, the other 24 hidden digits need to contain just two more; the probability of that is close to 70%, giving me a solid safety margin if I’m challenged while also putting pressure on the table.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 4's bid of 4 6s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (78420931), I don't have any 6s. Since there are 4 active players with 8 digits each (32 total digits), and Player 4 bid that there are at least 4 sixes, this means that the other 3 players combined must have at least 4 sixes. Given that I have zero 6s, all 4 would need to be distributed among the other 2 players (excluding Player 4 who made the bid). While this is possible, it seems somewhat unlikely. However, I do have one 7 in my hand, which gives me some confidence to bid 4 7s, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit. This is a safer move than challenging, as Player 4 might have multiple 6s in their hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. There are 32 total digits among 4 players. On average, there should be 3.2 of each digit. A bid of 4 is plausible and challenging it seems risky this early. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 4 8s, 4 9s, or increasing the quantity to 5. I have three 4s in my hand (48613447). Bidding 5 4s requires only 2 more 4s among the remaining 24 digits held by the other 3 players. Given the average of 2.4 for any digit in those 24 cards, and my strong holding of three 4s, this bid is statistically very likely to be safe. It's a stronger and safer bid than bidding 4 8s (I only have one 8) or challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 4s. In the last two rounds the total number of 4s was 7 out of 48 and 7 out of 40, about a 15-18% frequency. With 32 digits now, that rate projects to roughly 5–6 total 4s. The current bid is 5 4s; challenging would probably fail because reaching five 4s is very plausible. By raising the quantity to 6 4s I still stay within a realistic range: I only need 4 more 4s among the remaining 24 unseen digits, which past data suggests happens more than half the time. Therefore I should increase the bid rather than challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I can only account for one 4 in my own hand, leaving 24 hidden digits. With a uniform 10% chance per digit, the expected number of additional 4s is about 2.4, putting the overall expectation near 3-4 fours in total. Even allowing for the fact that 4s have run a little hot in previous rounds (say 15% instead of 10%), the probability that the table actually holds the six 4s Player 2 claims is still well below 50%. Since raising would require an even less likely bid that I couldn’t support, the best move is to challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I see two 4s in my own hand. In every prior round the total number of 4s revealed was 7, and none of the eliminated players appeared to contribute any 4s, meaning nearly all of those 7 belong to the three of us who are still in. Even if one of the departed players held a single 4, there should still be at least 6 left; 5 therefore feels very safe. Opening with 5 4s is a firm but reasonable first bid that builds on this history while leaving room to raise later.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge Player 2's bid of 5 4s. Looking at my hand (78420931), I have one 4. There are 24 total digits in play (8 digits for each of the 3 players). Player 2 has consistently bid on 4s across multiple rounds, and in previous rounds when challenged about 4s, the actual count was 7. This suggests Player 2 might have several 4s in their hand. With me having 1, and Player 2 likely having multiple, it's reasonable that there could be 5 or more 4s total. I could safely bid 5 7s since I have two 7s in my hand, or I could bid 6 4s if I believe the total count of 4s is higher. Given the history, I'll make a conservative higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s by Player 5. I have one 7 in my hand (48613447). This means the other 16 digits held by Player 2 and Player 5 must contain at least four 7s for the bid to be true. While possible, 5 total 7s out of 24 digits is significantly above the statistical average (2.4). Challenging is a viable option. However, I have a strong hand in 4s (three 4s). Player 2 previously bid 5 4s this round, and 4s have historically been frequent in this game (actual count was 7 in the last three rounds, although total digits were higher). Bidding 6 4s requires only three 4s among the other 16 digits. Given my hand and the game history, this seems like a reasonably safe and strong bid that leverages my hand's strength and puts pressure on the next player (Player 2, who previously bid 4s).

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my eight-digit hand. To satisfy Player 0’s bid of 6 4s, the remaining 16 hidden digits would need to contain at least four more 4s — a density that is unlikely even with the slightly elevated frequency of 4s we’ve seen in previous rounds. Estimating roughly, the chance that those 16 digits hide four or more additional 4s is well below fifty percent. Rather than commit myself to an even riskier higher bid, the best move is to challenge the current bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and it's my turn to start the bidding in a 1v1 situation against Player 5. There are 16 total digits (8 in my hand, 8 in Player 5's). My hand is 48613447, which contains three 4s. This is a significant portion of my hand (3/8) and above the statistical average (1.6 per digit across 16 total digits). Given my strong holding of 4s and the history of 4s being relatively common in previous rounds (though player counts have decreased), a bid reflecting my hand strength is appropriate. Starting with '3 4s' is safe but doesn't put much pressure. A bid of '4 4s' is a reasonable opening, assuming Player 5 holds at least one 4, which is statistically probable. This bid leverages my known information without being overly aggressive early in the head-to-head round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. I have 8 digits in my hand (78420931), and there are 16 total digits between myself and Player 0. The current bid is 4 4s. Looking at my hand, I have only one 4. For there to be at least 4 fours total, Player 0 would need to have at least 3 fours in their hand. While this is possible, it seems somewhat unlikely that they would have such a high concentration of a single digit. Looking at previous rounds, Player 0 has consistently bid on 4s, which might indicate they have some 4s, but bidding 4 4s as an opening bid could also be a strategic move rather than reflecting their actual hand. Given that I only have one 4, and assuming a somewhat random distribution of digits, I think challenging is the better option here. The probability of Player 0 having 3 or more 4s in their 8 digits is relatively low.
