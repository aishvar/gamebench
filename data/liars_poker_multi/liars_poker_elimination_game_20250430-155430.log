Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 5s. With 48 total digits and 46 unknown, the expected number of 5s among the unknown is about 4.6, making it highly likely (≈95%) that at least two more 5s exist. Opening with 4 fives is a strong but safe bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. With 40 total digits, the expected count for any digit is around 4. Since I already hold two 5s, it's plausible there are at least 2 more among the other 4 players. Opening with 4 5s leverages my strong holding while remaining conservative.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s made by Player 0. I have two 5s in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 secret digits, there are a total of 40 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Since I need to make a bid strictly higher than 4 5s, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I will increase the quantity to 5 and keep the digit as 5, because I have two 5s and it's a reasonable bid.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:3 - mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Since there are 40 digits remaining and 5 players, it's plausible that 5 5s exist. However, bidding higher on 5s is risky. I have two 6s, so bidding 6 6s is a reasonable increase in both quantity and digit. If I don't have enough confidence to bid higher, I could challenge, but given the plausible nature of the current bid, bidding 6 6s seems like a better strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. The current bid is 6 6s, requiring three more 6s among the 32 unknown cards to be correct (≈63% chance). Challenging now only wins ~37% of the time. If I bid 7 6s, I need four more 6s among the 32 unknown cards (≈40% chance), which is the most favorable move compared to other higher-digit bids.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:4 - qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid of 7 6s is higher than the expected count of 6s in 40 digits (which averages 4 per digit). Since I have no 6s in my hand (17708477), all 6s must be distributed among the other 32 digits across 4 players. Given Player 4's aggressive bid and the low probability of reaching 7 6s, challenging is a calculated risk. If the actual count is less than 7, Player 4 is eliminated, which is strategically advantageous.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have four 7s in my hand, making it a strong candidate for a bid. Starting the round with 4 7s leverages my own digits and sets a baseline that is likely to hold if challenged, as the total count cannot be less than four.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7, leaving 24 unknown digits. To reach a total of 4 sevens requires 3 of those 24, which has only about a 44% chance. The bid is more likely false than true, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have four 7s in my hand (17708477). Bidding 4 7s is a safe starting bid since the total count across all players must be at least 4 (my own count). This bid cannot be successfully challenged, forcing opponents to either bid higher or risk elimination. This follows my previous successful strategy of bidding 4 7s in earlier rounds.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is '4 7s' made by Player 5. I have 8 secret digits: 69996550. I can see that I have two 6s and two 5s, but no 7s. Given that there are 24 total digits remaining and 3 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. The current bid of '4 7s' seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. Since I don't have any 7s, I will challenge the bid as it seems unlikely that there are at least 4 7s in total among the 3 players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have four 7s in my hand. Since the total number of digits is 16, and I possess four 7s, bidding 4 7s guarantees the bid is at least equal to the actual count. This forces Player 3 to either make a higher bid or challenge and lose, as the minimum possible total for 7s is four.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. Since there are only 16 digits remaining in total (8 per player), and I have 1 7, it's possible that Player 5 has 3 7s. However, it's risky to assume they have more than 2 7s. Challenging seems like a good move since the bid is unlikely to be true.
