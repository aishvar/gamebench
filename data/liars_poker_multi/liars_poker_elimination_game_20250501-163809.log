Player 0 Reasoning: I have the digits 5, 0, 8, 8, 6, 4, 1, 7 in my hand. The digit 8 appears twice, which is the highest count for any digit I hold. Since this is the first bid and there are 48 digits total, starting with a modest bid of 2 8s is reasonable and not overly aggressive.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand, which is already more than the current bid of 2 9s. Since there are 48 total digits and only two 9s have been bid, it is very likely there are more 9s among all hands. I can safely increase the bid to 3 9s, which is both valid and based on my strong hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand of 8 digits (32314235). There are 48 total digits across 6 players. The expected number of any digit is 4.8. While I have no 9s, expecting 3 or more 9s among the remaining 40 digits held by other players is statistically reasonable (expected count is 40/10 = 4). Challenging seems risky this early. I need to bid higher, which means at least 4 of any digit. My hand contains three 3s. Bidding 4 3s is a safe and strong bid, as it leverages my hand. For 4 3s to be true, only one additional 3 is needed among the other 40 digits, which is highly probable (expected count is 4).

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 3s' and my hand containing 87463556, I notice I have no 3s but do have repeated digits. Considering the bids have been increasing and the last bid was on a relatively low digit, I should aim to increase either the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 3s and increasing the quantity further might be risky without knowing the distribution of other players' hands, I should consider bidding on a higher digit if I have enough information to make an educated guess. However, without specific knowledge of other players' hands, challenging might be risky. Given my hand and the need to make a higher bid, I could consider increasing the digit since I have multiple instances of higher digits, but I must ensure my bid is reasonable and not overly risky. Considering the total number of digits remaining and the fact that bids have been conservative so far, making a bid on a digit I have multiple of seems like a safer strategy than challenging without strong evidence against the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. Player 0 started the round by bidding on 8s, indicating they probably have at least one or two of them. With 48 digits in play, the expected count for any digit is about 5, so reaching a total of four 8s is quite plausible. By holding the quantity at 4 and simply raising the digit from 6 to 8, I make a strictly higher bid while keeping my own risk relatively low.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid but does not strongly confirm it. To make a valid higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. I have one 9 in my hand, so bidding 4 9s is a reasonable and valid increase, as it is higher than 4 8s and supported by my hand. Bidding 4 9s pressures the next player and keeps the bid believable.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. In my hand (96902279), I have two 0s. Statistically, with 48 digits in play and each digit equally likely, the expected number of 0s is about 4.8. A bid of 5 0s is just above expectation, but since I personally have two 0s, it's plausible someone else has a similar or higher count, making a challenge risky. To outbid, I can bid 5 2s, since I have two 2s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This is a safe incremental bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. There are 48 total digits. The expected average quantity for any digit is 4.8 (48/10). I have two 2s in my hand (32314235). This means the remaining 40 digits held by the other 5 players must contain at least 3 more 2s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 2s among those 40 digits is 4 (40/10). Since needing 3 is less than the expected 4, the bid of 5 2s is quite plausible, making a challenge risky. I should look for a higher bid. My hand contains three 3s. A bid of 5 3s would be higher (same quantity, higher digit). This would require only 2 more 3s from the other 40 digits (expected 4), making it very safe. A bid of 6 3s requires 3 more 3s from the other 40 digits (still below the expected 4). Given I hold three 3s, bidding 6 3s is a strong, justifiable bid that increases the pressure.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 6 3s, I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Looking at my hand, 87463556, I have two 6s and no 3s. Since the current bid is on 3s, I don't have enough information to confidently challenge or raise the bid on 3s. However, considering the distribution of digits and the fact that I have two 6s, bidding on 6s could be a good strategy. But, I must bid higher than 6 3s. A higher quantity of 6s seems plausible given my hand and the total number of digits remaining. Thus, bidding 7 6s appears to be a reasonable move, as it increases the quantity from the previous bid on a different digit, which is a valid way to make a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have zero 6s in my 8-digit hand. That means the other 40 unseen digits would need to contain all 7 (or more) 6s for the bid to be correct. With a 10% chance for any given digit to be a 6, the probability of at least 7 among 40 is only about 11%. Even granting Player 4 might hold several 6s, the overall chance the bid is valid remains well below 50%. Challenging gives me far better odds of winning than trying to out-bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am first to act this round, so I must place an opening bid. My hand contains two 3s. Out of the remaining 32 unseen digits, the expected number of 3s is about 3.2 (32 * 0.1). This gives an expected total of roughly 5 3s in play, and the probability there are at least 4 is comfortably high. Opening with 4 3s is therefore a solid, defensible bid that puts moderate pressure on the other players.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s, which is the lowest possible bid. I need to make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (96902279), I have three 9s and two 2s. Since there are 32 digits in total, it's reasonable to bid based on the digits I have the most of. I will bid 2 9s, which is the next valid higher bid (increasing quantity and picking a digit I have in abundance).

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 9s'. With 32 total digits, the expected quantity of any digit is 3.2. A bid of 2 is very likely to be true, making a challenge unwise at this early stage. My hand is 32314235, containing three 3s. Bidding based on my strength in 3s is logical. A bid of '3 3s' would be extremely safe, as I hold all three myself. A bid of '4 3s' is also statistically strong; I hold three, and only need one more 3 from the remaining 24 digits held by the other three players. Given the expected value and my hand, '4 3s' is a reasonable and safe progression of the bidding.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my own hand. With 32 total digits in play, the expected number of any single digit across all players is a little over 3. Since I already contribute 2 of the needed 3s, only 3 more are required from the remaining 24 unseen digits. That is quite plausible (roughly a 45%–50% chance), making a challenge against 4 3s too risky. The simplest legal raise is to increase the quantity by one while keeping the digit at 3, which leans on the strength of my hand without over-committing.

Player 5 Reasoning: I start the round and hold two 3s (33). That guarantees that at least two 3s exist among the 24 total digits no matter what the other two players have. Opening with the safe bid ‘2 3s’ carries zero risk of being wrong if someone immediately challenges, yet it sets a baseline the others must raise, giving me flexibility for later decisions.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. Looking at my hand (96902279), I have no 3s, so I cannot be confident that there are many 3s in play. However, with 24 digits total and two other players, it's very likely that at least 2 3s exist among all hands, so challenging now is risky. To make a valid bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and bid a higher digit. I have three 9s and two 2s in my hand, so bidding 2 9s is safe, but I previously bid 2 9s in this round. To keep the bid valid and increase the risk for others, I'll bid 3 9s, because I hold three 9s myself.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 2. I have zero 9s in my hand (32314235). For the bid to be true, the other two players (Player 2 and Player 5) must hold at least three 9s between their 16 digits. The expected number of 9s in those 16 digits is 1.6 (16 * 0.1). While 3 9s is possible, it's above the average expectation. However, I have a very strong hand in 3s (three 3s). I can make a bid higher than 3 9s. The next possible bid quantity is 4. Bidding 4 3s is a strong option. Since I hold three 3s, this bid only requires one additional 3 among the remaining 16 digits held by Player 2 and Player 5. The probability of finding at least one 3 in those 16 digits is high (approximately 1 - (0.9)^16 ≈ 81.5%). This seems significantly safer and more advantageous than challenging the 3 9s bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I see two 3s in my own hand. For the current bid of 4 3s to be true, there must be at least two more 3s in the 16 unknown digits held by the other two players. With a uniform distribution the expected number of 3s in those 16 digits is only 1.6, giving the bid less than a 50% chance of being correct. In addition, Player 2 chose to bid on 9s rather than increase the count of 3s, suggesting they don’t have many 3s. This makes Player 3’s bid look optimistic, so the best move is to challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: It's the start of the round with only two players (me and Player 2), and 16 total digits. My hand is 32314235. I have three 3s, which is the digit I hold the most of. A bid of '3 3s' is completely safe as I hold three 3s myself. However, to apply some pressure and make a stronger opening bid, I can consider bidding '4 3s'. This requires Player 2 to have at least one 3 among their 8 digits. Statistically, it's more likely than not (approx. 57% chance) that Player 2 holds at least one 3. Furthermore, I won the last round with a bid of '4 3s' (actual count was 5), which might make Player 2 hesitant to challenge a 3s bid from me early on. Therefore, bidding '4 3s' is a reasonably safe but strategically stronger opening move than '3 3s'.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 96902279, which contains no 3s. The current bid is 4 3s, meaning Player 3 is claiming there are at least four 3s between our two hands. Since I have zero 3s, Player 3 would need to have all four (or more) 3s in their hand of eight digits. The probability of one player having four or more of a specific digit in eight digits is low (about 6% for exactly four, even less for more). Given the risk and the fact that Player 3 opened with this bid, it's likely a bluff. Therefore, I should challenge.
