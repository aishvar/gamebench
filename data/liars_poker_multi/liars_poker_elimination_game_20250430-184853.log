Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can bid anything. I have two 8s in my hand. A conservative bid of 1 8s is reasonable to start, as it's based on my own hand and doesn't require assuming many 8s in other players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 1 8s, so bidding 2 8s increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Challenging would risk losing since I already hold an 8, making the actual count at least 1.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand, and with 48 digits in play, it's very likely there are at least two 8s among all hands. Challenging would not be wise. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. I have two 5s and two 1s, but only one 8. The safest move is to bid 2 9s, which is the minimum legal raise and does not commit me too far.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s, so I must raise the quantity. Bidding 3 5s is safe because I already see three 5s, guaranteeing at least that many across all hands while increasing the bid from 2 to 3.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are 3 5s across all hands. I should challenge the bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand, and with 32 unknown digits it's very likely there is at least one more 5. Opening with 4 5s is a strong but safe bid.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s made by Player 3. I have the hand 29279264, which contains two 5s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 5s, bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit seems reasonable. I will bid 5 5s as it is a straightforward increase in quantity based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have zero 5s in my hand. Given that there are 5 players with 8 digits each, totaling 40 digits, and the previous bid of 4 5s was successful, it's plausible that 5 5s exist. However, the previous round saw a challenge fail, indicating players are willing to bluff. I will bid 6 5s. This is a reasonable increase given the previous bids and my lack of 5s, making a challenge unlikely to succeed if I'm wrong. It also puts pressure on the next player.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 6 5s. Bidding 6 6s is a valid move, increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 6 6s, which means there must be at least six 6s among all 40 digits. With only one in my hand, and considering the distribution, it's unlikely there are five more among the remaining 32 digits (average occurrence of each digit is 4, as 40/10 = 4). The bid is already above average for 6s, making it a risky claim. Therefore, I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: As the first bidder this round, I should make an opening bid that reflects the strength of my hand while not being overly aggressive. My hand is 53561710, which contains two 5s, two 1s, one 3, one 6, one 7, and one 0. Bidding 2 5s is safe given my hand, but it's a very low opening bid and could be easily outbid. Bidding 3 5s is slightly more assertive and based on my two 5s, the odds are reasonable that at least one more 5 exists among the other 24 digits. Therefore, I'll open with 'BID: 3 5s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I hold three 5s myself, guaranteeing at least the current bid of three. Challenging would automatically lose. The expected number of additional 5s in the other 24 cards is over 2, so raising to 4 5s is a safe, logical increase based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s made by Player 3. I have the hand 29279264, which contains two 5s. Given that there are 32 total digits remaining across 4 players (8 digits per player), the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. The current bid of 4 5s seems plausible but I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be a lie. Since I have two 5s, and assuming the other players have a reasonable distribution, bidding 5 5s would be a straightforward increase in quantity.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:5 - google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have zero 5s in my hand. Given that there are only 32 total digits remaining among 4 players (8 digits each), and previous bids suggest a moderate number of 5s exist, a bid of 5 5s seems plausible but risky. Bidding higher, like 6 5s, would be extremely risky given my hand. I believe challenging is the best course of action, as the probability of there actually being five 5s is relatively low.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my turn as Player 5. I have the hand 29279264, which contains two 2s, two 5s, and other digits. Since I need to make a bid that is valid and higher than 'None', I can start with any quantity and digit combination that seems reasonable given my hand and the total digits remaining. Bidding 3 5s seems like a good starting point as I have two 5s and it's a relatively conservative bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand (digits: 5, 5, 3, 6, 1, 7, 1, 0). With 24 digits in play and two other players, it's very likely there are at least three 5s in total, so challenging is unwise. The next valid bid must be either 3 6s or 4 0s (since 3 6s is higher in digit, and 4 of any digit is higher in quantity). I have one 6 and one 0, so both are risky, but 3 6s is still plausible as an incremental bid. I'll bid 3 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s across 24 digits, and the probability that the other 16 unknown digits contain at least 3 sixes is only about 21%. It’s very unlikely to be true, so I should challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand. Bidding 4 5s requires only one more 5 from my opponent’s eight unknown digits, which has about a 57% chance. This is a plausible opening bid using the digit I hold most.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s made by Player 3. I have the hand 29279264, which contains two 5s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, I should consider the possibility of challenging or bidding. Since my hand contains two 5s and the bid is 4 5s, I should assess if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic.

Player 3 Reasoning: I hold three 5s in my hand. For Player 5’s bid of 5 5s to be correct, they must have at least two 5s among their eight digits. The probability of that is under 20%, making the bid unlikely. I should challenge.
