Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I can make an initial bid. I have four 7s in my hand. Bidding a small number of 7s seems like a safe starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand. To satisfy a bid of 4 1s, only one more 1 needs to be among the 40 unknown digits, which is extremely likely (>98% chance). This bid legally beats the current bid of 3 7s by increasing the quantity, while leveraging a digit I’m strong in.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8. While 4 1s is a plausible bid, I have a 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9 in my hand, giving me several options for a higher bid. Bidding 4 2s is a safe increase in digit while keeping the same quantity, and I have a 2 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have two 7s in my hand, and I know that there is at least one more 7 out there because Player 0 bid 3 7s. Bidding 5 7s seems reasonable since it increases both the quantity and the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand (54382096) contains one 7. The current bid is 5 7s, meaning at least five 7s among the 48 digits. Statistically, with 6 players and 8 digits each, each digit should appear about 4.8 times, so 5 7s is a reasonable but not conservative bid. Since I only have one 7, and unless someone has an unusually high number of 7s, it's not highly likely there are at least five in total. It's early in the round, so players may be pushing the count to test others. I will challenge, as I believe the likelihood of five or more 7s is low given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None'. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 6 7s seems reasonable, as it increases both the quantity and digit from the previous round's highest bid of 5 7s, which was validated. I should bid 6 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have zero 7s in my hand. Given the previous round's challenge failed (there were actually 7 sevens), and the total number of digits remaining is 40, a bid of 6 7s seems plausible. However, considering I have no 7s and the game history shows a willingness to bid high on 7s, challenging seems like the best option. It's risky, but I'm unlikely to be able to contribute to a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The previous rounds show that there are at least 7 7s in total, and considering the elimination of players, it's likely that there are fewer 7s remaining. Bidding 7 7s seems reasonable, as it increases the quantity of the previous highest bid of 6 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In the previous round (with 5 players, 40 digits) a challenge revealed there were exactly 7 total 7s. My hand still contains 1 of those 7s. That means the other 4 players together had 6. Player 5, who was part of that total, has since been eliminated and his 8 digits are no longer in play, so the current three opponents can have at most those same 6 (and possibly fewer) 7s. Adding my single 7, the absolute maximum now possible is 7. The current bid claims there are 8 7s, which is impossible. Therefore I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: As the first bidder this round I want a bid that is credible yet puts some pressure on the others. I already hold three 1s (67131901), so I only need one more 1 among the 16 unknown digits to make four. The chance of at least one 1 appearing in 16 random digits is about 82%, giving me strong confidence the bid is safe against an immediate challenge while not being too low. Therefore I’ll open with 4 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand.  With 3 players and 24 total digits, the average count for any digit is 2.4. A bid of 4 1s is slightly above average but not unreasonable.  Given my hand, I can make a slightly higher bid. Bidding 4 2s is a valid higher bid since the digit is higher, and I have one 2 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: With 24 digits remaining and 3 players, there is a high probability that at least 5 2s exist. However, I only have one 2 in my hand, and no other player has shown a strong preference for 2s. I should challenge the current bid of 4 2s, as it seems unlikely that there are exactly 4 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: There are 16 digits remaining across two players. Since I have two 7s, it's reasonable to assume there are at least 3 7s in total. Bidding 4 7s is a safe and strategic move to start the round, as it's a modest increase in quantity for a digit I know exists in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I only have one 7 in my eight-digit hand. For Player 3’s bid of 4 7s to be correct, their eight-digit hand would need at least three 7s. Under a uniform distribution the chance of getting 3 or more 7s in eight digits is below 4%. Even taking into account Player 3’s past fondness for bidding 7s, the odds remain heavily against there being four or more 7s among the 16 total digits. Challenging is therefore strongly in my favor.
