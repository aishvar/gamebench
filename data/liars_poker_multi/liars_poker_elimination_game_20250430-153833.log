Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 72925442, which contains a mix of digits. I have 2 fours, 1 two, 1 five, 1 seven, and 1 nine. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the distribution of my digits and the total number of players. Since there are 6 players and 8 digits each, a bid on a relatively common digit seems sensible. I will bid on a digit that I have, starting with a low quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand and the current bid of 3 4s is below the expected count. Raising to 3 5s is the minimal valid increase and very likely to be true, since I just need one more 5 among the other 40 cards.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s, which is likely valid given the average distribution of digits. To continue the round, bidding 4 1s leverages my strong holding in 1s and increases the quantity appropriately.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 1s and I have one 1 in my hand, increasing the quantity seems risky without more information. However, I notice that bidding the same quantity with a higher digit could be a viable strategy. Since I have two 5s and one 8, and considering the total number of digits remaining, bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity as the current bid might be reasonable. The presence of two 5s in my hand makes me more inclined to bid on 5s, as it's a digit I have more information about.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand of 84027761, I have zero 5s. The current bid is 4 5s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, the maximum possible 5s is 48. Player 3 claims there are at least 4 5s total. Given I have none, and this is early in the game with conservative bids, it's reasonable that other players might have 4 or more 5s between them. I see I have two 7s, so I can safely bid '4 7s', which is higher than '4 5s' by using a higher digit while keeping the same quantity. This is a safe play that builds on my known hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and have a good hand to work with. I see two 7s in my hand (84027761). Starting with a conservative bid of 3 7s is strategic since I already know about two of them, making it very likely there are at least 3 total among all players. This also builds on my successful 7s bid from last round where we learned there were actually 8 sevens total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. My hand is 72925442, which contains one 7. The total count of 7s must be at least 1 (mine) plus any from the other players. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 7, I believe there could be more 7s among other players, given the previous round's count was 8. I will increase the quantity to make a higher bid. Bidding 4 7s seems reasonable as it is a minimal increase.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits and a 10% chance per digit, the expected number of 5s among them is 3.2 and the probability of at least three more 5s (for a total of five) is about 63%, making a bid of 5 5s a reasonable raise.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 5s in my hand. With 40 total digits across 5 players, the average count per digit is 4. The bid of 5 5s requires at least 5 5s in total, which seems statistically unlikely given my hand and average distribution. Challenging appears risky but plausible.

Player 1 Reasoning: I hold two 5s and with 32 total digits the expected count of any digit is about 3.2, so bidding 3 5s is a safe opening bid that reflects my hand without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 5s and my hand containing two 5s, I have a reasonable basis to believe that bidding on a higher quantity of 5s or moving to a higher digit could be viable. However, considering the total digits remaining and the distribution, bidding on a higher digit seems more strategic. Since I have a 6 and a 9 in my hand, and given that the bid must be strictly higher, I could consider bidding on either of these digits if the quantity is appropriate. Given that the current bid is 3 5s, I can either increase the quantity or move to a higher digit. Bidding on 6s, given I have one, seems like a safer increase in digit rather than quantity, considering the total remaining digits and the need to make a strictly higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand (84027761). With 32 total digits and 4 players, the bid of 3 6s from Player 3 is quite reasonable. Given my two 6s, I know there only needs to be one more 6 among the other three players to make this bid valid. Based on the bidding history, Player 3 seems to be making conservative bids. I could bid 3 7s since I have two 7s in my hand, but that might be risky. A safer play would be to bid 3 8s, as I have one 8 in my hand and only need two more among other players, which is quite possible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have the digits 72925442, which means I have no 8s in my hand. Given that there are 32 total digits and 3 players left to reveal their hands, it's possible that the other players could have a total count of at least 3 eights. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have any 8s, I will increase the digit to make a more believable bid. Bidding 3 9s is a valid move as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. With 24 digits total, it’s likely there’s at least one more 5 among the other 16 unseen digits (probability >80%). Opening with 3 5s is a reasonable, plausible bid that leverages my known holding while pressuring opponents.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 3 5s and I have one 5 in my hand, I need to consider the likelihood of there being at least three 5s among all active players. Since I have 8 digits and so do the other two players, there are 24 digits in total. With one 5 in my hand, I need at least two more 5s to be present among the other players to meet the current bid. Considering the bidding history, players have made bids that suggest a spread of digits. However, without more specific information about the other players' hands, it's a gamble to either challenge or increase the bid. Given that my hand contains a 5, and increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same or increasing the digit with the same quantity are my options, I should consider what I know about common digit distributions and the fact that higher digits might be less common. Since I have a 6 and an 8 in my hand as well, and considering the previous rounds where bids involving higher digits were made and sometimes successfully challenged, I need to weigh the risk of challenging versus bidding higher. Given that I only have one 5 and no clear indication of how many 5s the other players might have, bidding higher on 5s directly might be risky. However, the presence of a 6 in my hand suggests an alternative strategy could be to bid on a higher digit if I feel the current bid on 5s is unlikely to be true or if I think I can safely increase the bid to a digit I have knowledge of, like the 6. But, since the current bid is on 5s and I only have one, challenging seems like a safer option if I believe the bid is unlikely, considering the total number of digits and the distribution so far. Given these considerations and the fact that I have limited information about the other players' hands, I must decide based on probability and the information I have. Challenging the bid of 3 5s seems reasonable because, with only 24 digits in play and my hand not significantly contributing to the count of 5s beyond one, it might be unlikely for there to be three 5s in total among all players, especially considering the spread of bids and challenges in previous rounds which sometimes indicated lower actual counts than bid upon.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have zero 5s in my hand (84027761). Given there are only 16 total digits between us, and Player 1 has consistently bid on 5s throughout the game (and won challenges with them), it's very likely they have at least 2-3 5s in their hand. Their bid of 2 5s is quite conservative given the history, so it's probably true. I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, which gives me confidence to bid '2 7s', increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity.

Player 4 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (84027761), I have zero 5s. Since there are only 16 total digits in play (8 per player), and Player 1 is claiming there are at least 3 fives total, this means they would need to have at least 3 fives in their hand since I have none. While possible, this seems unlikely. Additionally, Player 1 has shown a pattern of bidding on 5s throughout the game, which might indicate bluffing. Given I have zero 5s and the relatively high claim of 3 in a two-player game, challenging is the safer move.
