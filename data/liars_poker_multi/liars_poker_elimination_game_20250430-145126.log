Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bid, I need to start with a valid quantity and digit. My hand contains three 9s, so bidding 3 9s establishes a baseline based on my own cards. This is a logical starting point as it reflects my hand's composition without overcommitting.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s and one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s. I don't have any 9s. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move as it increases both the quantity and the digit. Challenging 3 9s is risky because there could be enough 9s among the other players' hands.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s. Bidding 4 8s increases the digit while maintaining the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. With two 8s in my hand and five other players, it's plausible there are at least four 8s total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 8s, I must decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. With my hand being 57696732, I have one 8, but considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 players, the likelihood of having at least 4 eights seems plausible but not extremely high. However, since I need to make a strictly higher bid, I could increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 for the digit 8 seems risky without more information about other players' hands. On the other hand, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same or higher is a viable strategy. Given that I have two 6s and a 7, and considering the bids so far, bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity or slightly higher seems reasonable. Since the current bid is on 8s, the next higher digit is 9, but I only have one 9 in my hand. Thus, considering the balance of risk and potential gain, I should consider challenging the current bid as it seems on the higher end of probability given the information at hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to establish a reasonable starting bid. My hand contains two 8s, making 3 8s a plausible initial bid. Since there are 5 players, it's likely there's at least one more 8 in other hands. Bidding 3 8s leverages my existing digits while allowing room for escalation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I do not have any 8s in my hand, so I have no personal support for this bid. However, the previous round showed that a bid of 4 8s was valid, so 3 8s is plausible. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. I have one 9 in my hand, so bidding 3 9s is a reasonable increase, as it is a higher digit with the same quantity. This is a safe move to keep the game going without risking a challenge too early.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 39086379, which contains two 9s. The current bid is 3 9s by Player 4. Since I have two 9s myself, it's plausible that there is at least one more 9 among the other players' hands to make the total of 3. However, I need to make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity to 4 9s or bid on a different digit. Given that I have two 9s, bidding 4 9s seems reasonable as it might still be believable. Alternatively, I could bid on another digit I have, like 3s or 8s, but since 9s are already high, increasing the quantity to 4 9s keeps the pressure on others. I don't think challenging is wise here because the bid of 3 9s is not overly aggressive with 40 total digits in play. Therefore, I'll bid 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. My hand contains three 9s. With 40 total digits remaining across 5 players, the actual count of 9s could be as low as 3 (if others have none). Challenging this bid risks the bidder's validity, as the true count might be insufficient. Since I have a significant portion of the 9s, a challenge could expose the bid as false.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 39086379, which gives me two 9s, two 3s, and one each of 0, 6, 7, and 8. Starting with a conservative bid based on my strongest digit, I will bid 3 9s. This accounts for the two 9s I have and assumes at least one more among the other players, which is reasonable with 32 total digits across 4 players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s and one 8 in my hand. Given that the current bid is 3 9s, I could bid 4 6s again, but that might be too risky. I could also bid 4 8s, but that was recently challenged and won. Since I have a reasonable number of 8s, I should challenge the current bid of 3 9s, as it seems likely that there are not three 9s among the remaining players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 39086379, which gives me two 9s, two 3s, and one each of 0, 6, 7, and 8. With a total of 24 digits across all three players, I can make a conservative bid based on my strongest digit. Bidding 3 9s seems reasonable as I already have two 9s, and it's likely that at least one more 9 exists among the other 16 digits. This is a safe starting point to gauge the other players' responses.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Given that there are 24 total digits and previous challenges on 3 9s were successful, the bid is likely valid. Bidding 4 8s increases the quantity while leveraging my two 8s, which is a safer escalation than challenging a probable true bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I must bid higher, either by increasing the quantity or the digit. My hand has one 8 and one 9, so bidding 4 9s is a valid next step and reasonable given the previous bids. Bidding 4 9s is higher than 4 8s and not excessively risky.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:1 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 4. In my hand, I have two 9s out of my 8 digits. With three active players and a total of 24 digits, it's possible that there are at least two more 9s among the other 16 digits, making the total count of 9s at least 4. Given the bidding history, Player 4 might also have some 9s to support their bid. Challenging now carries a risk since the bid seems plausible. Instead, I will make a higher bid of 5 0s, increasing the quantity, as it's a safer move to avoid an immediate challenge while still pushing the game forward. I have one 0 in my hand, which gives me some basis for this bid, though it's still a bluff to test the other players.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:3 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. The current bid is 5 0s, meaning at least five 0s must exist across all players. Given that I have two, the remaining 16 digits (from Players 4 and 5) would need to contain at least three more 0s. Assuming uniform distribution, the expected number of 0s in the remaining digits is 1.6, making the total expected count 3.6. Since 5 is significantly higher than this expectation, the bid is likely false. Challenging is the optimal move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: As the starting player with two 8s in my hand, bidding 3 8s is a reasonable opening. Since there are two players, the total digits for 8s could be up to 8. My two 8s plus at least one from the opponent (Player 4) would satisfy the bid. This bid is conservative yet leverages my existing digits, making it plausible without overextending.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I must bid higher. I have no 8s in my hand, so bidding higher on 8s is risky. The next higher bid could be 3 9s or 4 0s. I have one 9 in my hand, so bidding 3 9s is reasonable and safer than challenging at this point.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s by Player 4. My hand contains one 9, so Player 4 would need at least two 9s for the bid to be true. Given that 9s are rare and Player 4 has 8 digits, the probability of them having two 9s is low. Challenging is a strong move here, as the bid is unlikely to hold up. Even if Player 4 has one 9, the total would be 2, making the bid false.
