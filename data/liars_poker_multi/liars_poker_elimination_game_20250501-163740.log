Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to establish a reasonable starting bid. My hand contains four 4s, which is a strong base. Bidding 5 4s accounts for my four 4s and assumes at least one additional 4 exists in the remaining 40 digits. This is a conservative yet strategic opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s, made by Player 0. My hand is 47237474, which contains three 4s and three 7s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8. The current bid of 5 4s is close to this average, and my hand contributes significantly (3 out of 8 digits are 4s). Given I hold three 4s, it is very likely that the total number of 4s is 5 or more, making a challenge risky. I need to make a higher bid. Based on my hand, I have strong counts of both 4s and 7s. Bidding 5 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit compared to 5 4s). I have three 7s, meaning only two more 7s are needed from the other five players (40 digits total among them) to meet a bid of 5 7s. This seems quite likely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I hold three 5s. To beat the current bid of 5 7s I can raise the quantity. Claiming 6 5s feels solid: I already provide half of the required count, and with 40 unseen digits among the other five players the probability of finding at least three additional 5s is high (around 75%). This is safer than challenging a bid that is likely true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand (86490293), I have the following digits: 8, 6, 4, 9, 0, 2, 9, 3. I have zero 5s. The current bid is 6 5s, which means there must be at least 6 fives among all 48 digits. On average, each digit appears around 4.8 times (48/10). Bidding 6 5s is slightly above average, but not implausible. Since I have no 5s, I am less inclined to raise the bid on 5s. Instead, I can consider bidding 6 6s, since I have one 6 in my hand, or 6 8s, as I also have one 8. However, both would be risky as I only have one of each, but it is still within the realm of possibility. To stay in the game and avoid an early challenge, I will raise to 6 6s, which is the lowest valid bid above 6 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which supports the current bid of 6 6s to some extent. However, with 48 total digits across 6 players, a bid of 6 6s is plausible but on the lower side of average (expecting about 4.8 of each digit if evenly distributed). I think it's safer to raise the bid slightly rather than challenge, as the bid doesn't seem outrageously high. I will bid 7 6s, increasing the quantity by 1, as I have some 6s myself and it's a reasonable escalation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. To beat this, I need to either bid at least 8 6s or 7 7s. My hand contains one 5, one 7, one 8, one 1, one 9, and one 3. I have no 6s, so increasing the quantity of 6s is impossible. Bidding 7 7s is unlikely since I only have one 7. Bidding 8 6s is impossible because I have no 6s. The most reasonable move is to challenge, given the low probability that there are at least 8 sixes across all hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The previous bid of 7 6s was challenged and found to be false, with only 2 sixes in total. Since no current bid exists, I can start the bidding. My hand contains 1 six, 1 five, and other digits. To be safe, I should bid a number that is plausible given my hand. I have one 6, so bidding 1 6s is conservative but safe, or I could bid higher to pressure others. Considering my hand, bidding 2 6s might be risky since I only have one six, but I do have a 7, which could suggest I might have more sixes. To avoid immediate challenge, I will bid 2 6s, slightly higher than my own count, betting that others might have fewer sixes overall.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have four 4s in my hand. Bidding 5 4s is a higher quantity than the current bid of 2 6s and leverages my strong holdings in 4s. With five players remaining, it's plausible there's at least one additional 4 in other hands, making the total count likely â‰¥5. This bid balances aggression with the evidence from my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s made by Player 0. My hand is 47237474, containing three 4s and three 7s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected count for any digit is 4. Since I hold three 4s, the bid of 5 4s seems quite plausible (requiring only 2 more 4s from the other 32 digits). Challenging would be risky. I need to make a higher bid. Bidding on digits I hold multiple of is strategic. I have three 4s and three 7s. Bidding 6 of either 4s or 7s is well-supported by my hand (requiring 3 more from the remaining 32 digits, where the expected count is 3.2). Bidding 6 7s is a valid higher bid than 5 4s (higher quantity) and is strongly supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I can personally account for 2 of the required 6 sevens. That means the other 32 hidden digits would need to contain at least 4 more 7s. With a 10% chance for any given digit to be a 7, the expected number of 7s in those 32 digits is only about 3.2. The probability that there are 4 or more is under 50%, so the current bid is more likely false than true. A direct challenge gives me better than even odds to eliminate Player 1, whereas raising the bid would expose me to similar or greater elimination risk. Therefore I should challenge now.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 4 4s is a reasonable and likely starting point. It's based on my strong hand in 4s and requires only one additional 4 among the other 24 digits.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have the digits 8, 6, 4, 9, 0, 2, 9, 3 in my hand, which includes one 4. With 32 digits in play, it is very likely that there are at least 4 total 4s among all players. Challenging now would be risky. The lowest valid higher bid is 4 5s. I do not have any 5s, but this is still a safe incremental bid that keeps me in the game without overcommitting.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s, and I have the digits 5, 1, 5, 7, 8, 7, 1, 9. Counting the 5s in my hand, I see two 5s. Since the bid is 4 5s, and I only have 2, it's unlikely that the total across all players is 4 or more. Challenging the bid seems appropriate because the previous bid is probably overestimating the total count, given my hand and the previous bids. Challenging now could win if the total is less than 4.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current round has no bids yet, so I can start with a bid. My hand contains 5, 1, 5, 7, 8, 7, 1, 9. Counting the 6s, I see none. The highest previous bid was 7 6s, but since no bid has been made in this round, I can initiate with a conservative bid. Bidding 2 6s is reasonable, as I have no 6s, but I want to stay safe. Alternatively, I could bid 2 7s, but I have no 7s. Therefore, starting with 2 6s is safe and strategic.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have four 4s in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s. Bidding 5 4s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and is likely true since the other two players are expected to have at least one 4, making the total at least five. Challenging the 2 6s bid has a roughly 51% chance of success, but bidding 5 4s is safer and forces opponents to respond.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s, made by Player 0. My hand contains three 4s and three 7s. Since I hold three 4s, the bid of 5 4s is plausible, making a challenge risky. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than 5 4s. Bidding 5 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). I have three 7s, so this bid requires the other two players to have a combined total of at least two 7s among their 16 digits. This is a reasonable expectation, making 5 7s a plausible bid based on my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains three 7s and two 4s. As the first bidder in this round with 16 total digits, a bid of 4 7s requires only one additional 7 from the opponent (Player 0).

Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, so the total 7s depend solely on Player 1's 8 digits. The bid of 4 7s requires Player 1 to have at least 4. Given the low probability of randomly having 4+ 7s in 8 digits (expected value = 0.8), challenging is a high-probability win. Bidding risks higher uncertainty (e.g., 5 4s requires Player 1 to have at least 1 4, which is more likely but less certain than challenging a 4 7s bid).
