Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and need to make the first bid. My hand is 18696471. I have two 1s and two 6s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits. The expected number of any digit across all hands is 48 / 10 = 4.8. Since I have two 1s, the expected total number of 1s is 2 (my hand) + (40 other digits / 10) = 2 + 4 = 6. Bidding '4 1s' is a safe opening bid, below the expected total count, leverages my hand, and uses a low digit, leaving room for future bids.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have three 6s in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. Having three 6s in my hand makes it likely that there are more 6s among other players. Bidding 5 6s is a reasonable increase in both quantity and digit based on my hand and the average distribution.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand. The current bid is 5 6s, which I cannot support as I have no 6s. Bidding 6 5s increases the quantity while using a digit I hold, making it a safer and more plausible bid than challenging a potentially accurate 5 6s claim.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 6 9s only requires four more across the other 40 cards, which has a probability of about 0.58. Challenging 6 5s is less favorable (only ~0.37 chance itâ€™s false), and by bidding 6 9s I use the highest digit at this quantity, forcing opponents to jump to 7s if they want to overbid. Thus I will bid 6 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid of 6 9s is quite high considering: 1) I have no 9s in my hand, 2) It's early in the game with 6 players remaining, and 3) Even if other players have some 9s, getting to 6 total would require multiple players to have multiple 9s, which is statistically unlikely. Given my hand shows no 9s and the relatively high quantity being claimed, challenging is safer than making a higher bid of 7 or more.

Player 4 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and have 8 digits in my hand. Looking at my hand (60362578), I have one 6, which is a decent middle-range digit. Since I'm opening the bidding, I should start conservatively but not too low. With 5 players having 8 digits each (40 total), and seeing one 6 in my hand, bidding 3 6s seems reasonable - it only requires 2 more 6s among the other 32 digits held by other players.

Player 5 Reasoning: Player 4 bid 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable increase, as it's a higher quantity while keeping the digit the same. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit, but given I only have one 6, increasing the quantity of 6s seems like the best option. Bidding higher on a digit I don't have is too risky.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I hold two 6s in my hand (18696471). With 40 total digits among 5 players, the expected number of any digit is 4. The bid requires only two more 6s from the remaining 32 digits held by the other four players. The expected number of 6s in those 32 digits is 3.2 (32/10). Since needing 2 is below the expected value of 3.2, challenging the bid of 4 6s is too risky; it's likely correct. I need to make a higher bid. Options include 4 7s, 4 8s, 4 9s, or increasing the quantity to 5. Considering my hand, I have two 1s and two 6s. Bidding 5 1s requires 3 more from 32 digits (plausible). Bidding 5 6s also requires 3 more from 32 digits (plausible). Given that Player 4 bid 3 6s and Player 5 raised to 4 6s, continuing with 5 6s builds on the existing bid pattern, leverages my two 6s, and is statistically reasonable.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. The current bid is 5 6s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected number of any digit is around 4 (40 / 10). Having three 6s makes a bid of 5 6s plausible, and challenging is risky since Player 0 might have multiple 6s as well. Bidding 6 6s is a safe increase based on my hand strength.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have no 6s in my hand (55108845), so the total 6s must come from the other four players. The bid of 6 6s is likely true since the maximum possible 6s is 32 (others' digits). However, I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 8 (which I have two of). Bidding 6 8s leverages my two 8s and increases the digit, making it a stronger bid than 6 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have exactly one 8 in my hand (60362578). The current bid claims there are 6 eights total across all hands. Given there are 5 active players with 8 digits each, and I only have one 8, there would need to be 5 more 8s among the other 32 digits I can't see. While possible, the bidding sequence shows aggressive raising, and Player 2 jumped from 6 6s to 6 8s, which seems like a risky move. Based on my single 8 and the bidding pattern, I think it's unlikely there are actually 6 eights total.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 6 and one 5 in my hand. With 32 total digits and 4 players, a conservative opening bid would be reasonable. Based on previous rounds, I know 6s were common, appearing at least 3 times in earlier rounds. Starting with 3 6s seems safe as I have one 6 myself, and it's a digit I've had success with before.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Given the history of challenges, players seem willing to push bids. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable increase, and I have a 6 to contribute. Bidding a higher digit would be risky without knowing what others hold. The total number of digits remaining is 32, so 4 6s is not an unreasonable claim.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (18696471). This means only two more 6s are needed among the other 24 digits held by the other 3 players for the current bid to be true. Given that Player 4 previously bid 3 6s and Player 5 raised to 4 6s, it's plausible they hold at least one 6 each, making the current bid likely true. Challenging seems risky. I should make a higher bid. I have two 6s and two 1s. Bidding 5 6s requires three more 6s from the other 24 digits. Bidding 5 1s requires three more 1s. Given the previous bidding focused on 6s, continuing with 5 6s leverages my hand and the bidding history, putting pressure on the next player. It seems like a credible bid.

Having three 6s makes a bid of 6 6s plausible, as it's only slightly above the number I hold and increases the quantity from the previous bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (60362578). The current bid of 6 6s by Player 1 means there need to be at least 5 more 6s among the other three players' hands. Given that players have been consistently raising bids on 6s this round, and my previous challenges on high bids were successful, this bid seems too high. With only 32 total digits remaining and one 6 in my hand, it's unlikely there are 5 more 6s among just three other players. The pattern of increasing 6s bids suggests players might be bluffing.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 18696471, containing two 6s. The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 5. There are 3 players and 24 total digits. Player 1 previously bid 3 6s, and Player 5 raised to 4 6s. This suggests both Player 1 and Player 5 likely hold at least one 6 each. With my two 6s, the total count of 4 6s is plausible, making a challenge risky. Bidding 5 6s is the next logical step. This requires 3 more 6s from the other 16 digits held by Player 1 and Player 5. Given their previous bids focused on 6s, it's reasonably likely they hold enough 6s combined to support this bid. It continues the bidding sequence and puts pressure on Player 1.

A bid of 5 6s is slightly above average expectation but not unreasonable, especially since I hold three.  However, I can make a slightly higher bid based on my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 18696471, containing two 6s and two 1s. The current bid is 7 6s by Player 5. There are 3 players and 24 total digits. I have two 6s, so for the bid of 7 6s to be true, the other two players (Player 1 and Player 5) need to have at least 5 sixes combined in their 16 digits. Player 1 previously bid 6 6s, suggesting they likely hold 2 or 3 sixes. Player 5 then bid 7 6s. If Player 1 has 3 sixes and Player 5 has 2 (or vice versa), the total count would be 7 (2+3+2=7). Challenging 7 6s seems risky as it's plausible. I need to make a higher bid. Options include 7 7s, 7 8s, 7 9s, 8 0s, 8 1s, 8 6s etc. Bidding 8 6s seems like a bluff that might be challenged, especially by Player 1 who bid 6 6s. Bidding on 7s, 8s, or 9s requires 6 more from the other 16 digits (since I have one of each). Bidding 8 1s utilizes my two 1s and requires 6 more 1s from the other 16 digits. This is a significant increase in quantity, changes the digit away from the heavily contested 6s, and puts pressure on the next player based on my hand.

A bid of 8 1s is quite high, representing one-third of all remaining digits. While it's possible, it feels risky for Player 0 to make such a high bid on 1s, especially after the previous rounds focused heavily on 6s. Given my lack of 1s and the high quantity bid, challenging seems like the most strategic move. It's unlikely there are 8 1s among the three players.

Four 6s is a plausible bid, but given I have three of them, it's quite likely there are at least four total. I could bid 5 6s, which is a reasonable step up based on my hand and the total digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand (46670605). The current bid is 6 6s by Player 5. With 16 total digits, bidding 6 6s means Player 5 thinks there are at least three 6s in their hand (since I have three). This is possible but pushing the probability. Bidding 7 6s would require Player 5 to have at least four 6s, which is less likely. Bidding a higher digit like 6 7s is also an option, but I only have one 7.
