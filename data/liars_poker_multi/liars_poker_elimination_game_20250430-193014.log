Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to set a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand contains two 5s. Bidding 3 5s is a low but plausible starting point, assuming others have at least one 5. This allows room for subsequent bids while being defensible if challenged.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. Player 0 bid 3 5s, which seems plausible but I can increase the bid safely by focusing on a higher digit. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 3 7s is a reasonable next move, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s made by Player 1. I have the digits 33688347, which means I have two 7s. Given that there are 6 players and each has 8 digits, the total number of digits is 48. A bid of 3 7s implies that there are at least three 7s in total. Since I have two 7s, there must be at least one more 7 among the other players' hands. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I can see that I have a total of 3 '3's and '8's, which are relatively high counts. However, making a bid on '3' or '8' with a quantity of 4 or more might be too aggressive without knowing others' hands. A safer bid would be to increase the digit, so bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as it is a higher digit and I have two 8s in my hand, supporting the possibility of others having 8s as well.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand and expect about 4 more among the 40 unknown cards, giving an expected total of 7 3s. Bidding 5 3s only requires two additional 3s (≈92% chance), and raises the quantity above the current 4 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. In my hand (11960890), I have two 1s, two 9s, two 0s, one 6, and one 8. I have zero 3s, so the bid is not supported by my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits, so on average, there would be about 4.8 of each digit. A bid of 5 3s is just above the expected average, making it plausible but not obviously false. Since I have two 1s and two 9s, I can safely raise the bid to 5 9s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit), supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. My hand contains one 9, making it uncertain if the total across all players meets this. Bidding 6 0s is safer because I have two 0s, and zeros are more likely to be common in other players' hands. This increases the quantity while leveraging a digit I hold, making the bid plausible.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. With 5 other players, it's possible there are at least 4 more 0s among them, making the total at least 6. However, bidding higher would require either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since 0 is the lowest digit, I can't increase the digit without increasing the quantity. Bidding 7 0s seems risky, and challenging might be premature given the possibility of other players having 0s. I'll make a conservative bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have the digits 33688347, which means I have no 1s. The total number of digits is 48, and with 6 players having 8 digits each, it's possible that the count of 1s is around 6. However, since I have no 1s, I need to consider the likelihood of the other players having a significant number of 1s. Given that the bid is already at 6 1s, making a higher bid seems reasonable if I can justify it. I can bid 6 2s, which is a valid higher bid because 2 is greater than 1. Alternatively, I could challenge if I think 6 1s is unlikely. However, since there are 5 other players and 40 digits outside my hand, it's plausible they have 6 1s. My hand has 3s and 8s, but not 1s. I will make a higher bid by increasing the digit.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. In my hand (11960890), I have no 3s, which makes me less confident about the bid. However, since it's early in the round and 4 is a modest quantity with 40 digits in play, it's likely someone else has some 3s. Instead of challenging a reasonable early bid, I will make a higher bid. I have three 0s and two 9s, so I can bid 4 0s, which is a higher digit at the same quantity, and I have strong evidence for 0s in my own hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 11960890, which contains two 0s, two 9s, two 1s, one 6, and one 8. The current bid is 4 3s. Since I have zero 3s, I cannot directly support the bid, but 4 is not an unreasonable number with 40 digits in play. However, it is early in the round and the bid is conservative. To avoid challenging too early and risking elimination, I should safely increase the bid. I will bid 4 6s, as I have one 6 and 6 is a less commonly bid digit, making it a safe incremental raise.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have no 6s in my hand, but the expected number of 6s across all players is 4 (based on 40 total digits and 10% probability for each digit). Challenging risks elimination if the count is exactly 4. Bidding 4 7s maintains the same quantity but increases the digit, which is a valid higher bid. The expected number of 7s is also 4, making this a plausible and strategic move without overcommitting.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s, which means there would need to be at least two more 7s among the other four players (total of 32 digits). Given that 7s are relatively common, this seems plausible. I can either bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 9 in my hand, I can bid 4 9s, which is a higher digit than 7s but maintains the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 3, one 6, one 7, two 3s, and one 8 in my hand (33688347), meaning I have no 9s. The total count of 9s must be at least the count held by other players. With 5 active players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in total. Given that I don't have any 9s, the count of 9s is distributed among the other 4 players. A bid of 4 9s implies that the other players collectively have at least four 9s. This seems plausible but is on the higher side because it requires the other players to have a significant number of 9s. However, considering the history of the game and the fact that Player 5 bid 5 9s in the previous round, it's possible that there are several 9s. To make a higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since the quantity is already 4, I can either bid 5 9s or bid on a higher digit like 4 0s (though the latter is not a higher bid, it's worth considering the next possible bid). Bidding 5 9s seems risky but is a valid move. I will analyze the risk. If I challenge and the count is less than 4, I win, but if it's 4 or more, I lose. Given that there's a reasonable chance that the count is 4 or more (especially considering the previous round's bidding), challenging is risky. Bidding 5 9s increases the quantity and is a valid higher bid. However, given my hand and the fact that I'm not sure about the distribution, I should be cautious. I will bid 5 9s as it's a straightforward higher bid.
