Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None'. I have two 7s in my hand. I can reasonably bid 3 7s, as it's likely that at least one other player has a 7 in their hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '7' in my hand, and the current bid is 3 7s. Since the total digits are 48, having at least three 7s is quite plausible. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. I don't have any higher digits repeated, but I have one '9', so bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid and reasonable given the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have the hand 27818012, which contains one 8 and no 9s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I don't have any 9s, bidding 4 9s might be too risky. However, bidding 3 0s or any other 3 [digit]s where [digit] > 9 is not possible because 9 is the highest digit. I can bid 4 0s or higher. Given that I have one 8, it's plausible that there are more 8s across all hands. Bidding 4 8s seems like a reasonable action as it increases the quantity and is based on a digit I know exists in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand contains three 5s and two 8s. While 4 8s is a plausible bid (I have two, needing two more from the other 5 players), bidding 5 5s is a stronger move for me based on my hand. I already hold three 5s and only need two more from the remaining 5 players' hands to make the bid true. This seems more likely than the other possible higher bids given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand and expect about 4 fives among the 40 unknown digits (mean 40*0.1=4), so the probability of at least 5 fives is only about 37%. The current bid of 5 5s is unlikely, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round. My hand contains three 5s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits remaining. The average expected count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. Bidding 5 5s is slightly above the statistical average but is a plausible starting bid based on my hand and sets a reasonable bar for subsequent players. I also had success with a bid of 5 5s in the previous round.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 5 5s, which was just proven correct in the previous challenge (actual count was 6). With 40 total digits remaining and 4 other players, it's possible there are more 5s. However, bidding higher would require either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since the current bid is already high, I'll challenge to test if the count is indeed at least 5.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: It is the start of a new round and there is no current bid. My hand is 59685685. Counting the digits in my hand, I have three 5s, two 6s, two 8s, and one 9. My strongest digit count is three 5s. With 4 players and 32 total digits, a bid of 4 5s is a reasonable opening bid based on my hand and the expected distribution of digits among the remaining players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have two 7s in my hand. With 32 digits remaining, it is reasonable to assume that there are at least 4 6s or 7s across all hands. Bidding 4 7s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, making it a valid and strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand and given the total of 32 digits, bidding slightly higher is reasonable. Increasing the digit to 8 while keeping the quantity at 4 is a valid higher bid and plausible given the digits distribution.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 1. My hand is 27818012, which contains one 8. I have to make a bid higher than 4 8s. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I see one 8 in my hand, bidding on a higher digit seems reasonable. I will bid 4 9s, as it is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I must bid higher, which means increasing the quantity to at least 5. My hand contains three 5s. Bidding 5 5s means I need two more 5s from the remaining 24 digits held by the other three players. The expected number of 5s in 24 digits is 2.4, so needing 2 is very plausible and makes 5 5s a strong bid based on my hand. Challenging 4 9s is less appealing as 4 is close to the expected number of 9s (3.2) in 32 digits, and I do hold one 9 myself.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. The current bid is 5 5s. Since I have three 7s, I can reasonably bid 6 7s, increasing both the quantity and the digit. This bid is likely to be successful given the distribution of digits so far and the fact that 5 5s have been bid twice and won both times, suggesting there are at least 6 5s in play. Bidding 6 7s is a strategic move to capitalize on my hand while maintaining a competitive edge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s, which means there are at least six 7s among all players' digits. I have one 7 in my hand (40424159). Given there are 32 digits total, having six 7s is plausible but somewhat high. The next valid bid must be either more than six 7s or six 8s or higher digits. I only have one 7 and no 8s or 9s in my hand. Bidding 6 8s or higher seems risky without any 8s in my hand, and increasing quantity to 7 is a big jump. I think challenging the current bid is reasonable as it might be an overestimate, given the distribution and my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have the digits 4, 0, 4, 2, 4, 1, 5, 9 in my hand. I have three 4s, which is a strong count for that digit. Since there is no current bid, I can start with a bid that reflects my hand and is reasonable to challenge others. Bidding 3 4s is a solid start because I have exactly three 4s, making it plausible and a good baseline to build upon.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s, made by Player 1. I have the hand 27818012, which contains two 1s, one 2, one 8, one 0, and two other digits. I see one 8 and no 4s in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 4s, I'm inclined to believe the count of 4s is likely less than 3 across all hands, but I need to consider the total count across all players. Given that there are 24 digits in total and 3 players, it's possible that other players have 4s. I will bid 3 5s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, as it's a relatively safe move and higher than the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 2. My hand contains three 5s (59685685). Therefore, the total count of 5s across all hands is at least 3. Challenging the bid of 3 5s would mean asserting the count is less than 3, which I know is false due to my hand. Thus, challenging is not an option. I must make a higher bid. Based on my hand, I know there are at least three 5s. Bidding 4 5s requires only one additional 5 from the remaining 16 digits held by Player 1 and Player 2. This is a statistically probable outcome. Other options like bidding 3 6s or 3 8s are also plausible as I have two of each, needing one more, but bidding 4 5s increases the quantity, putting more pressure, and is a direct step up from the current bid on a digit I hold in quantity.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Given there are 24 digits total and 3 players, having at least 4 fives is plausible. To raise, I must bid higher than 4 5s. The next valid bids could be 4 6s or 5 0s. I have no 6s, but I do have one 4 and one 9, which doesn't help with 6s or 0s. Bidding 4 6s seems a reasonable incremental increase, as bidding 5 0s might be too big a jump and risky. Hence, I will bid 4 6s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 1. I have the hand 27818012, which contains one 6 and one 8. Given that there are 24 total digits and I see one 6 in my hand, it's plausible that the total count of 6s is at least 4, considering the other two players also have 8 digits each. However, I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I can bid 4 7s or 5 6s. Since I have one 8, I am inclined to believe there could be a reasonable number of higher digits. Bidding 4 7s seems like a safe and reasonable next step as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 2. My hand contains zero 7s. With 24 total digits remaining (8 per player), the average count for any digit is 2.4. A bid of 4 7s is significantly above average. Since I have no 7s, the other two players (Player 1 and Player 2) must collectively hold at least four 7s among their 16 hidden digits for the bid to be true. Based on probability (approx 7% chance of 4+ 7s in 16 digits assuming uniform distribution) and the historical data from the previous round where there were only four 7s among 32 digits, the bid of 4 7s seems highly unlikely to be true. Challenging offers a high probability of winning the round and eliminating Player 2.

Bidding based on my strongest digit count (three 5s) is a good strategy for the opening bid. A bid of '4 5s' is a reasonable step up from my hand count, implying I expect at least one more 5 from the other player, which is quite probable with 8 digits in their hand. This is a solid opening bid that leverages my hand strength.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Given there are 16 digits in total, bidding 5 5s is plausible but risky since I only hold one 5. Increasing the quantity to 5 5s is the minimal valid raise and keeps pressure on the opponent. Bidding a higher digit at the same quantity is not possible since 5 is the lowest digit bid at quantity 4. Therefore, I will bid 5 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. My hand contains three 5s. This means Player 1's bid implies they have at least 5 - 3 = 2 fives in their hand of 8 digits. With 8 digits, the probability of having 2 or more of a specific digit is about 18.7%. This makes the bid of 5 5s relatively unlikely based on probability alone. Bidding higher would require an even less likely distribution of digits (e.g., bidding 5 6s would require Player 1 to have 3+ 6s, which has a lower probability). Therefore, challenging the bid is the most statistically sound move.
