Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, starting with a high digit (9) maximizes leverage since higher digits are harder to disprove early. My hand contains one 9, so bidding 2 9s assumes at least one other player has a 9, which is plausible given there are five other players. This bid sets a strong foundation using the highest possible digit to limit opponents' options.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains three 2s. The current bid is 2 9s. By bidding 3 2s, I increase the quantity while leveraging the strong presence of 2s in my hand. Since I already have three 2s, the total count across all players must be at least three, making this a safe bid that forces subsequent players to bid higher or challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have two 2s in my hand. Bidding 3 3s seems reasonable, increasing the digit based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. My hand contains the digits 9, 2, 1, 5, 0, 8, 6, 4. I have one 9, one 2, one 1, one 5, one 0, one 8, one 6, and one 4. The total number of 3s in all hands is unlikely to reach 4, given only 6 players and my own single 3. Bidding 4 3s would be a stretch, but increasing the digit to 4 seems safer and more plausible, considering I have a 4 in my hand. Since I have one 4, and the total number of 4s across all hands is unlikely to reach 4, I should challenge the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. My digits are 9, 2, 1, 5, 0, 8, 6, 4. The total number of digits is 8, so bidding 1 of any digit I have seems safe and strategic to establish a baseline. Bidding 1 9s would be strong, as I have a 9, and it's unlikely anyone has more than 8 total 9s, making it a safe opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s, which is extremely low given that there are 40 digits in play. I know I have two 5s in my hand, which makes bidding 2 5s a reasonable step up because it reflects a digit I already hold in good quantity. Increasing the bid to a quantity of 2 means I'm raising the stakes while still keeping the bid plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. Bidding 2 9s increases the digit to 9 while keeping the quantity the same, which is valid. Since Player 3 previously bid 1 9s and I have one 9, the total might be at least 2, making this bid plausible.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s. Bidding 3 2s increases the quantity while using a lower digit, which is a valid higher bid. Given my three 2s and potential contributions from others, this seems safer than challenging a 2 9s bid that might already meet the threshold.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have the digits 9, 2, 1, 5, 0, 8, 6, 4. I know I have at least one 2, but only one. To beat 3 2s, I need at least 4 2s overall, which I cannot confirm I have. Alternatively, I can increase the digit while keeping the same quantity, but my hand has only one 2, so I can't bid 3 3s or higher. The previous bid was 2 6s, which is quite high, but I don't have any 6s, so challenging might be better. Given the low count of 2s in my hand and the current bid, challenging seems more strategic, as it's unlikely the total count of 2s across all hands is 3 or more.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:3 - deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. With 24 unknown digits across 3 other players, the probability of at least one more 2 is high. Bidding 4 2s is a safe starting bid that leverages my strong hand and statistical likelihood of additional 2s in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 57825706, which gives me two 7s. The current bid is 4 2s, and I must make a bid strictly higher than that. By bidding 4 7s, I leverage the fact that I already hold two 7s. This means only two additional 7s are needed among the 24 unknown digits from the other players—a scenario with roughly a 70% likelihood. This makes the claim plausible and statistically safer than sticking with 2s or moving to a digit I have less of.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, guaranteeing that at least two 7s exist among the 24 digits in play. With 16 digits held by opponents, it’s likely there could be at least one additional 7, making a bid of 2 7s a safe and conservative opening. This bid is supported by my hand and forces subsequent players to either raise the quantity or bid on a higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. Bidding 2 9s increases the digit value (9 > 7), same quantity), making it a valid higher bid. My hand has one 9, and there's a reasonable chance other players have at least one more 9. This avoids increasing the quantity, reducing risk while staying within plausible probabilities.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. The current bid is 2 9s. Bidding 3 2s increases the quantity while leveraging my strong 2s, making it a safe and valid higher bid. Since 3 > 2, this meets the requirement regardless of the digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I only have one 2 in my hand, which makes the current bid of 3 2s somewhat risky from my perspective. However, I hold two 7s, which means bidding on 7s gives me a strong edge. By bidding 3 7s, I only need one additional 7 from the 16 unknown digits, which is very likely (around an 82% chance). This bid is both legal and strategically sound compared to challenging the current bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 3 8s increases the digit to 8, which is higher than 7, making it a valid bid. Even with only one 8 in my hand, I'm bluffing that there are three in total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. With 16 remaining digits among other players, there's a high probability (over 80%) they hold at least one more 2. This makes a bid of 4 2s statistically safe while strictly increasing the quantity from the current 3 8s bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-mini-2025-01-31), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is '4 2s' but I only hold one 2 in my hand. Given that the two opponents have 16 digits in total, the expected number of additional 2s is around 1.6, making the probability of there being at least 3 extra 2s (and thus 4 or more in total) roughly 21%. This makes the bid quite unlikely to hold true, so I will challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand has three 2s, the highest count among my digits. With 16 total digits in play (8 from each player), bidding three 2s is safe since even if the opponent has zero 2s, the total matches my bid exactly. This minimizes risk as the opening move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwq-32b:nitro), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. Bidding 3 4s is a valid higher bid (since 4 > 2). This bid requires at least three 4s in total. I have two 4s, so only one more is needed from the opponent, which is plausible. Challenging risks losing if they have three 2s, so raising to 3 4s is safer and strategic.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 4s in my hand. The opponent's bid of 3 4s requires them to have at least three 4s in their 8-card hand. Statistically, the probability of holding ≥3 of a specific digit in 8 cards is low (~3.8% assuming uniform distribution). Given this unlikelihood and my lack of 4s, challenging is strategically sound.
