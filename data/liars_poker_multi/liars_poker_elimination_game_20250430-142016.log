Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the bidding and there are no previous bids to consider, I should make a bid that is reasonable based on my hand. I have a diverse set of digits, which gives me flexibility. Since I have one of each digit except for 0, 3, 4, 7, and 8, I can bid on any of the digits I have, aiming for a moderate quantity to avoid being too aggressive. Bidding on a digit that I have at least one of seems like a safe start. Considering the total number of digits in play (48) and aiming to make a bid that is not too high but still engaging, I will choose a digit and quantity that reflects a balance between being competitive and being cautious.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I could raise the bid to 4 0s, 4 1s, 4 2s, 4 3s, 4 4s, 4 5s, 4 6s, 4 7s, 4 8s or 4 9s, or I could bid 3 7s, 3 8s, or 3 9s. Given that I only have one 6, it's risky to bid higher on 6s. However, without more information, I'll conservatively raise the bid to 4 0s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. It's unlikely that there are more than 4 0s in total across all players' hands. I should challenge the bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None'. I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 4, one 6, one 7, one 9. I will bid a small amount of a digit I have. I will bid 1 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. Bidding 2 4s is a logical next step, as it increases the quantity while staying within a reasonable range given the limited information. It's a relatively safe bid, and I don't have strong reason to believe it's a lie. Bidding a higher digit would be more speculative without knowing anything about the other players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my eight-digit hand. The current bid of 2 4s is therefore certainly true, so challenging would lose. By increasing the bid to 3 4s I only need one additional 4 among the 32 unknown digits. With the expected distribution this has a very high likelihood (~96%), making it a safe escalation that meets the requirement of being strictly higher than 2 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 7, 0, 6, 6, 7, 8, 2, 4. I have one 4. The current bid is 3 4s, which is not unreasonable with 40 digits in play. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity to 4 of any digit or bid 3 of a higher digit. I have two 6s and two 7s in my hand, making '3 6s' or '3 7s' relatively safe. However, since 3 6s has already been bid in the previous round, and to keep the bid modest, I will bid '3 7s', leveraging my two 7s and the likelihood that at least one more 7 exists among the other 32 digits.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 7s and my hand containing one 7, I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Since my hand has a 7, which is the digit of the current bid, and considering the total number of digits remaining is 40, bidding higher on the same digit might be risky. However, I also have a 9 in my hand, which could potentially allow for a higher bid on a different digit. Yet, without knowing the distribution of other digits among players, making a significantly higher bid on a different digit (like my 9) could be speculative. Given these considerations and the fact that I only have one 7, which does not strongly indicate a high presence of 7s, I should challenge the current bid of 3 7s, as it seems uncertain and my single 7 does not provide enough confidence to bid higher on 7s or switch to a higher digit with confidence.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first to bid this round. My hand is 70667824, which contains three 6s and two 7s. As the opening bidder, I want to choose a bid that is credible based on my hand and not too aggressive, to avoid being immediately challenged. Bidding 3 6s is safe since I hold three 6s myself, making it very likely to be correct and hard for others to challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I could bid 3 7s or higher. I could also bid 4 of any digit. Given that I have a 4 and a 7, bidding 4 0s is not possible, and bidding 4 7s seems risky. I will bid 4 0s, since it is the lowest possible bid that is higher than the current bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have zero 0s in my hand. Given the previous rounds and the elimination of players, it's reasonable to assume there aren't many 0s remaining. Bidding 5 0s is risky. I have two 9s, so bidding 3 9s is a valid and potentially strong move. It's higher than the current bid of 4 0s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have zero 0s in my hand. Given the previous rounds, players seem willing to bid relatively high. Since I have two 9s, bidding 4 9s is a reasonable attempt to increase the bid and potentially bluff. It's a higher digit than 0, and the quantity is the same as the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains zero 9s, so all four 9s would have to come from the 24 digits held by the other three players. With an expected 2.4 nines in 24 random digits, the probability of there being at least four is only about 20%. Even if Player 3 is betting because they hold a couple of 9s, the chance the bid is valid is still comfortably below 50%. Making a higher bid would force me to jump to a quantity of 5 of some digit, which is statistically weaker and more likely to be challenged. Challenging now offers the best odds of eliminating Player 3 while keeping my own risk comparatively low.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is None. I have three 9s in my hand. Bidding 4 9s is a reasonable starting bid, as it's based on my hand and is a valid first bid. It's also a digit that hasn't been bid on heavily in previous rounds.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 70667824, which contains zero 9s. With 24 digits total and only 8 in my hand, I have no direct evidence of 9s. The current bid is 4 9s, which requires that the other two players collectively hold all four 9s. Given the distribution of digits, it's possible but not certain. However, since 4 is not an extremely high quantity for a digit among 24, and challenging at this point carries risk if the other hands are heavy in 9s, a conservative strategy is to increment the bid modestly with a digit I have more of. I have two 6s and two 7s. The safest higher bid is '4 9s' -> '4 0s' (quantity same, digit higher), but I have only one 0. Instead, I can go to '4 7s', since I have two 7s and it's possible the others have at least two more.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 70667824, which contains no 9s. The bid is 4 9s with only 24 digits total among 3 players. For the bid to be valid, the other two players must have at least 4 9s between them, which is possible but unlikely, especially since I have 0. Challenging here is a strong move.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. That means there need to be at least three more 9s in Player 3's hand. This seems plausible, but not overwhelmingly likely. I could challenge, but I could also bid higher. I will bid 5 0s to increase the pressure and see how Player 3 responds. Since I have one 0, there needs to be at least four 0s in Player 3's hand. It is a bit risky, but I'll bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. I have three 9s. Bidding 6 0s would be a lie and likely to be challenged. Bidding 5 1s is possible, but I have no 1s. Bidding 5 2s is also possible, but I only have two 2s. Bidding 5 3s is also possible, but I only have one 3. Bidding 5 8s is possible, but I have no 8s. Bidding 5 9s is possible, and I have three 9s. However, given the history of challenges, and the fact that Player 1 is likely trying to bluff, challenging the bid seems like the best course of action. There are only 16 digits total, and 5 0s seems relatively high.
