Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I’m opening the bidding. I hold two 5s. With 48 total digits in play, the expected count for any digit is around 5, so at least four 5s overall is quite plausible. This is a reasonable opening bid that leaves room to maneuver while still being safe against an immediate challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have zero 5s in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 5s is possible. I have two 6s, so I can bid 1 6s, 2 6s, 3 6s, or 4 6s. I also have two 1s, so I can bid 1 1s, 2 1s, 3 1s, or 4 1s. Since the previous player bid 4 5s, bidding 4 6s is a reasonable increase in both quantity and digit. Bidding 5 5s would be too risky without knowing other players' hands. I will bid 4 6s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand and no 6s. Challenging 4 6s is only about a 43% win, so it’s risky. Instead, I can minimally raise to 4 9s, needing just one more 9 among the other 40 cards—over a 98% chance—making it a very safe bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits in total. The current bid is 4 9s, which is plausible at this stage. Since I only have one 9, I can't be confident that there are at least four 9s among all players, but it's not unlikely either. It's still early in the round, and challenging now is risky. I have two 5s in my hand, so I can safely raise the bid to 5 5s, increasing the quantity and switching to a digit I hold more of.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 6 5s is a safe increase. Also, I have three 6s so I can bid 5 6s safely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand (01834440). While 5 is only slightly above the expected average of 4.8 (48 digits / 10 possibilities), my lack of 6s makes me slightly skeptical. However, challenging this early feels risky. I should consider making a higher bid based on my hand. My strongest digit is 4, with three 4s. Bidding 6 4s is a statistically strong move. It increases the quantity from 5 to 6. With my three 4s, only three more 4s are needed from the remaining 40 digits held by the other 5 players. This is well below the expected average (4.0 needed from others vs 4.8 expected total) and seems like a safe and strategic increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. Players have already bid 4 5s and 5 5s this round, so several other 5s are likely in play. Claiming six 5s therefore feels plausible, and it beats the current bid by keeping the quantity the same while raising the digit. This lets me advance the bidding without taking the 20-25% risk of losing an immediate challenge against 6 4s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I have zero 5s in my hand. The previous bids show a lot of activity around 5s and 6s, but 6 5s is still a relatively high number given there are only 48 total digits. I have two 6s, so increasing to 7 6s is a reasonable bid. It's a slight increase in quantity and leverages the digits I have.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 6s in my hand and there are only 40 unknown digits across the other players, so the expected number of 6s is about 4. The probability of there being at least 7 is under 10%, making the bid highly unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand and opponents have 32 unknown digits, which on average include ~3.2 more 9s, so total 9s likely ~6.2. Bidding 5 9s is below this expectation (≈84% chance) and sets a strong, safe opening.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 13054953, which contains two 9s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in play. The current bid is 5 9s. Statistically, each digit should appear about 4 times (40/10), so 5 is just slightly above average. Since I have 2 of the 9s, there need to be only 3 more among the remaining 32 digits, which is plausible. Challenging now would be risky. To make a legal higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. The next possible bid is 5 0s. Looking at my hand, I have one 0. While it's not much, 0 is a digit that could plausibly appear 5 times across all hands, and it keeps my bid conservative. Therefore, I will bid 5 0s.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 13054953, which contains two 9s. The current bid is 5 9s. With 5 players and 8 digits each (40 digits total), the expected number of 9s is about 4 (since each digit is equally likely). Having two 9s myself makes it possible there are 5 or more, but it's still a relatively aggressive bid. However, it's not so improbable that a challenge is clearly correct. The safest play is to make a minimal higher bid. I will bid 5 0s, as I have one 0 in my hand, and this increases only the digit, not the quantity, keeping my risk low.

Since I have two 9s, there would need to be three more among the remaining 32 digits. This is possible but not guaranteed, and the bid is not excessively high. Rather than challenge, I will make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 0 (since I have one 0 in my hand), resulting in a bid of 5 0s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. With 32 total digits, the expected average count for any digit is 3.2. Therefore, 3 5s is a statistically plausible and low bid, making a challenge risky. I have zero 5s myself. My hand contains three 4s. Bidding 4 4s is a valid higher bid (increasing the quantity). Since I hold three 4s, this bid only requires one additional 4 among the remaining 24 digits held by the other three players. This is highly probable. This bid leverages my strong hand of 4s and is safer than challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 5s. Player 4 opened this round with the bid 3 5s, so it’s very plausible they have at least one or two more 5s. With 32 total digits in play, the probability that the other 24 unknown digits contain at least two more 5s is comfortably over 70 %. In contrast, challenging the current bid of 4 4s would knock me out roughly one-third of the time. Therefore, the safer course is to outbid by keeping the quantity at 4 but raising the digit to something I’m already well-represented in: 5s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. Raising to 4 9s only requires one more 9 among the 24 unknown digits, which has about a 92% chance, and it’s a valid raise over 4 5s (same quantity, higher digit). This is safer than challenging and puts pressure on opponents.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. The total number of digits remaining is 32. I could bid 5 0s, 5 1s, 5 2s, 5 3s, 5 4s, 5 5s, 5 6s, 5 7s, or 5 8s. Or I could bid 4 of any digit higher than 9, which is impossible. I have two 6s and two 5s. Bidding 5 0s seems like the safest option, as it doesn't rely on the quantity of digits in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have two 0s in my hand (01834440). With 32 total digits, the expected number of 0s is roughly 3.2. My two 0s plus the expected 2.4 from the other 24 unknown digits equals 4.4. The bid of 5 is slightly above the expected value, making a challenge plausible but not certain. However, I have three 4s. Bidding on 4s is a strong alternative. The expected number of 4s is also 3.2. With my three 4s, the total expected count is 3 + 2.4 = 5.4. Bidding 6 4s leverages my strong hand, is statistically plausible (close to the expected 5.4), and increases the pressure on the next player more effectively than a challenge or a smaller bid like 5 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 4s, so all six 4s would have to come from the other 24 unknown digits. Randomly, the chance of at least six 4s in 24 digits is only about 3%. Even giving Player 5 credit for holding an unusually large number of 4s (three or four), they would still need several more from the other two players, leaving their true success chance roughly coin-flip at best. Any higher bid I could make (e.g., 6 5s) would be far less likely to be true with my hand, so the strongest play is to call the bluff now.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It’s the first bid of the round, so I only need to place any legal opening bid. I hold two 5s (5,5) in my eight-digit hand. With 16 unknown digits among the other two players, the expected number of additional 5s is about 1.6 (16 × 0.1), giving a strong chance that at least one more 5 is out there. Therefore a bid of 3 5s is both credible and conservative, leaving room to maneuver upward if needed.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 0s in my eight-digit hand. To satisfy the current bid of 4 0s, all four (or more) 0s would have to come from the 16 unseen digits held by Players 2 and 4. Even if Player 4 is sitting on a couple of 0s, the odds of the total reaching four are still well under 25%. Given that risk, it is far more likely the bid is an overreach than that it is accurate. Challenging now gives me roughly a three-in-four chance to knock out Player 4 and reach the final two, which is better than making a marginally higher bid and facing a possible counter-challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: I already hold one 9, so the current bid of 2 9s will be correct as long as my opponent has just one more 9—something that happens about 57% of the time. Challenging would therefore be risky. On the other hand, I have two 5s. I only need one additional 5 in the opponent’s eight unknown digits to make a total of 3, and the probability of at least one 5 appearing in eight random digits is also about 57%. By raising to 3 5s, I move the pressure back to Player 2 with a bid that is more likely to be true than not, while avoiding the unfavorable odds of a direct challenge.
