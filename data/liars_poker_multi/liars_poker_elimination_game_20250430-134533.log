Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 19457788, which gives me three 7s and two 8s as my strongest digits. Bidding on 7s seems safer to start with a moderate bid. I’ll bid 4 7s, assuming there’s a reasonable chance other players have at least one 7 in their hands, given the total of 48 digits across all players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. To beat this bid, I need to bid at least 5 7s or 4 8s. Since I only have one 7, I cannot bid 5 7s. Bidding 4 8s is plausible because I have an 8, but I only have one 8, so I can't support a bid of 4 8s confidently. Given the total of 48 digits, and only one 7 in my hand, the likelihood of there being 4 or more 7s across all players is low, but not impossible. Bidding 4 8s would be a safe higher bid than 4 7s, and I have an 8, so I can support that bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 8s' and my hand '95685067', which contains one 8, I must decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Since my hand does not provide strong evidence for a higher quantity of 8s or a significant presence of a higher digit, I should consider the likelihood of the current bid being true. With 48 total digits and 6 players, the maximum number of any digit is capped at 48. Given that I have one 8, and without knowledge of other players' hands, it's uncertain but plausible that there could be at least 4 eights among all players. However, considering the distribution and the fact that I only have one 8, challenging seems like a reasonable option, especially since making a higher bid would require either a higher quantity or moving to a higher digit, both of which seem risky without more information about the other players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Player 1 started this round with no bid, so I have the opportunity to make the first bid. My hand contains the digits 4, 0, 9, 5, 8, 7, 6, 3. Counting the number of each digit: 0 (1), 3 (1), 4 (1), 5 (1), 6 (1), 7 (1), 8 (1), 9 (1). Since all digits appear once, the total count for each digit in my hand is 1. The total digits remaining across all players is 40, so the minimum bid I can make is 1 of a certain digit. To be safe and to bid higher than no previous bid, I will bid '1 4s', as I have a 4 in my hand. This is a reasonable opening bid given my hand and the game state.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 4s. I have one 4 in my hand, making the bid potentially true. Challenging would risk elimination if the bid is valid. Bidding 2 4s is a logical next step, as it slightly increases the quantity while maintaining the same digit, leveraging my existing 4 and accounting for possible 4s in others' hands.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand (29034536). The current bid of '2 4s' is quite conservative given there are 5 players with 8 digits each. Rather than challenge this likely-true bid, I can safely increase to '3 4s' since having just 2 more 4s among the other 32 digits seems probable. This puts pressure on the next player while staying reasonable.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 52355012, which contains two 4s. The current bid is 3 4s. With 40 digits in play and only a bid of 3, it's likely there are more than 3 of any digit, so challenging is too risky. To make a legal higher bid, I can raise the digit while keeping the quantity the same, or increase the quantity. I have three 5s in my hand, so bidding 3 5s is safe and strictly higher than 3 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 19457788, which contains two 7s and two 8s, but no 5s. The current bid is 3 5s by Player 5. Since I have no 5s, I need to assess if 3 5s is likely across all 40 digits. With 5 players each having 8 digits, it's possible but not highly likely given I have none. However, challenging now might be risky as 3 is a low quantity. Instead, I can make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 3 5s, I can bid either 3 6s or higher. Given I have two 7s, bidding 3 7s feels safer as it aligns somewhat with my hand, and it's a reasonable increase. I'll bid 3 7s to avoid an immediate challenge and keep the game moving.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s, and I know I have the digits 4, 0, 9, 5, 8, 7, 6, 3. I have one 7, so I can't safely bid more than 3 7s without risking an immediate challenge. Bidding 4 7s would be risky; however, I do have a 7 in my hand, and the total number of 7s across all hands could be close to or just above 3. Since the previous bid was 3 7s, I can challenge, especially because the total number of 7s in all hands cannot exceed 8 (since each player has 8 digits and only one player has a 7). Given the total remaining digits, the maximum number of 7s is 5 (if all other players have no 7s). The bid of 3 7s is plausible, but challenging is a safer move because the count of 7s is unlikely to be less than 3, and challenging could confirm or eliminate an opponent.

Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 19457788, which gives me three 7s and two 8s as my strongest digits. With a total of 32 digits across all players, bidding on a digit I have a decent count of is a safe strategy to start. I’ll bid 4 7s, as I already have three 7s, and it’s plausible that at least one more 7 exists among the other 24 digits. This bid is conservative yet assertive to gauge the other players' responses.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. Bidding 5 7s increases the quantity while maintaining the same digit, which is plausible if other players have additional 7s. Since 7s are common digits and I hold one, it's reasonable to assume there may be at least four more in the remaining 24 digits of the other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand (29034536). The current bid of 5 7s means there need to be at least 5 sevens among all 32 digits. Given that I only have 1 seven, and we need 4 more sevens from the other 24 digits (3 players × 8 digits), this seems unlikely but not impossible. The probability is low enough to warrant a challenge, especially since the bid is already quite high at 5, making it harder for the next player to make a reasonable higher bid if I don't challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have 8 digits in my hand (29034536) and there are 24 total digits in play. Based on previous rounds, I've seen aggressive bidding on 7s, suggesting other players might have some. Looking at my hand, I have one 3, which is a safe starting point. Since this is the first bid of the round and I want to start conservatively, bidding 2 3s seems reasonable - I have one, and there's a good chance at least one more exists among the other 16 digits in play.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 52355012, which contains two 3s. The current bid is 2 3s, which I already have in my hand, so it is very likely that there are at least two 3s among all 24 digits. The minimum valid higher bid is either 3 3s or 2 4s. Since I also have two 5s and two 0s, I could consider bidding on those, but starting with a conservative increase is safest. Bidding 3 3s is a safe and logical move.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 19457788, so I have no 3s. The current bid is 3 3s by Player 5. With only 24 total digits across three players, and knowing I have zero 3s, the bid of 3 3s means the other two players would need to have at least 3 3s combined in their 16 digits. This is possible but not highly likely given the distribution. However, since it's a low bid, I’ll play it safe and make a higher bid rather than challenge. I have three 7s and two 8s in my hand, so bidding 3 7s seems reasonable as it’s a higher digit with the same quantity, and I know I contribute significantly to the count.

Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand, I only have one 7. With 3 players total and 24 digits in play, Player 0's bid of 3 7s means there need to be at least 2 more 7s among the other players. While this is possible, Player 0's bidding pattern shows they've bid 7s multiple times, which could be a bluff. Given I can see only one 7 and would need 2 more among just 16 remaining unknown digits, this seems unlikely enough to challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand (29034536), I have one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 9, one 2, and one 0. Since I'm starting the bidding in a two-player game with 16 total digits, I should make a conservative opening bid based on what I know I have. Starting with '2 3s' is reasonable since I have one 3 in my hand, and it's likely the opponent has at least one 3 as well, given the frequency of middle digits in previous rounds.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 52355012. Counting the 3s, I have one 3. The current bid is 2 3s, so for Player 4's bid to be valid, there must be at least one 3 in their hand. With only 16 digits in play and based on probability, it's possible but not guaranteed. However, challenging a bid of 2 for any digit is risky given that I already have one. It's safer to make a higher bid, especially since I have three 5s in my hand, making a bid on 5s statistically strong.

Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 5. For Player 5's bid of '3 5s' to be true, they would need to have at least two 5s in their hand since the total claimed is 3. While possible, this seems unlikely given my hand. Additionally, looking at the game history, Player 5 has been aggressive with their bids. Since we're down to just two players with 16 total digits, and I know for certain there's only one 5 in my hand, I should challenge as the bid requires two more 5s in their hand.
