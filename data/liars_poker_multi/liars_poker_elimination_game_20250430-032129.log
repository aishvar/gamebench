Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 27895720. I have one 0, two 2s, one 5, two 7s, one 8, and one 9. The current bid is 1 0s. I can easily bid higher. A safe bid is to increase the quantity of 0s or bid a higher digit. Since I have one 0, bidding 2 0s is a safe and reasonable increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (67151368), I don't have any 0s. Player 1 has bid 2 0s, which means they believe there are at least 2 zeros among all players. Since I have 0 zeros in my hand, and there are 6 players with 8 digits each (48 total digits), it's quite possible that there are at least 2 zeros among the other 40 digits I can't see. The bid of 2 0s is quite conservative and likely true. I should make a higher bid. I have one 1, one 3, one 5, one 6, two 7s, one 8, and no 0s, 2s, 4s, or 9s in my hand. Since I have one 1 in my hand, bidding on 1s might be reasonable. I'll bid 2 1s, which is higher than 2 0s because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand. The current bid is 2 1s. Bidding 3 3s increases the quantity and leverages my own high count of 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. My hand contains three 9s. With 48 total digits among 6 players, the average count for any digit is 4.8. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid (increasing the quantity). This bid is well-supported by my hand, as I hold 3 of the required 4 nines, meaning only one more is needed from the other 40 digits, which is quite likely. Challenging 3 3s seems premature as it is a plausible bid given the total number of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s, so I’d need all 4 out of the 40 unknown digits, which has only a ~58% chance. Instead I can bid 5 8s: I hold two 8s and need just three more among the 40 unknowns. With an expected 4 unknown 8s (P(at least 3) ≈78%), this is a much stronger bid. Thus I should raise to 5 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4.8. A bid of 5 9s is slightly above average but not unreasonable, especially if Player 0 has multiple 9s.  I have two 2s and two 7s, which could support bidding on those digits. Bidding 6 of any digit is a valid increase. Bidding 6 2s or 6 7s seems like a reasonable step up from 5 9s, as I have two of each. Bidding 6 2s is a lower digit than 6 7s, making it a slightly safer bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid and my hand. The current bid is '6 2s' made by Player 1. Looking at my hand (67151368), I don't have any 2s, which means I can't contribute to the count of 2s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. For there to be at least 6 twos, other players would need to have them. It's possible but not certain. I could challenge, but it's still early in the game, and 6 out of 48 digits being 2s (12.5%) is reasonable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have one 3 in my hand, so I could bid '6 3s', which is higher than '6 2s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity. This is a safer move than challenging at this stage.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid of 6 3s requires at least 6 threes in total. With 48 digits across 6 players, the average count per digit is 4.8. I hold three 3s, leaving an expected 1.8 threes in other players' hands (4.8 - 3). This makes the total likely below 6, making the bid improbable. Challenging is statistically favorable.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand, making it a strong candidate for a bid. Starting the round with a bid of 4 3s leverages my own digits and assumes at least one more 3 exists among the remaining 32 digits (40 total - 8 in my hand). This is a conservative opening bid that aligns with my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s, which is the average expected count for any digit with 40 total digits. My hand is 69099514, containing three 9s and zero 3s. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Since I hold three 9s, I only need one more 9 from the remaining 32 digits held by other players for this bid to be true, which is highly probable. This is a safe and strong bid based on my hand. Challenging 4 3s is risky as it's an average bid and Player 3 might hold 3s. Bidding 5 9s is also possible but less certain than 4 9s. I will make the safe and strong bid of 4 9s.

Player 4 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round. My hand contains three 9s, which is my most frequent digit. With 4 players and 32 total digits, bidding 4 9s is a reasonable opening bid. It's slightly above my hand count but likely to be true, requiring only one additional 9 among the other 24 digits held by the other players. This leverages my hand strength effectively as a starting bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round. My hand contains three 9s. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the expected count of any digit is 2.4. Having three 9s in my hand makes bidding on 9s a strong option. The expected total count of 9s is 3 (from my hand) + (16 remaining digits * 0.1 probability) = 4.6. Bidding 4 9s is a reasonable starting bid based on this expectation and leverages my strong hand for 9s. This is also a bid I successfully defended in the previous two rounds when starting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one 9. The current bid is 4 9s. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the average count for any digit is 2.4. A bid of 4 9s is slightly above average, but not outrageously high, especially since Player 4 has successfully bid 4 9s twice before. However, with only one 9 in my hand, I don't have strong support to raise the bid on 9s significantly. Bidding 5 0s or 5 1s is a possibility, but I have no 0s and only one 2 (which could act as a wild 0). Given the history of Player 4 successfully bidding 4 9s, and my limited information about the other hands, challenging is a risky move. Bidding a higher quantity of a digit I have more of, like 3 2s, is a safer option and a valid higher bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 27895720. I have one 9. The current bid is 4 9s. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the average count of any digit is 2.4. While 4 9s is slightly above average, Player 4 has successfully bid 4 9s twice already in previous rounds, suggesting they might have a strong hand of 9s. Challenging here is risky given Player 4's history with this bid. I need to make a higher bid. I have two 2s and two 7s. Bidding 5 of a digit is a significant jump. Bidding 4 of a higher digit is a safer increase. I have a 0, two 2s, a 5, two 7s, an 8, and a 9. Bidding 4 9s is the current bid. I can bid 5 of any digit or 4 of a digit higher than 9, which is impossible. I have two 2s and two 7s. Bidding 5 2s or 5 7s seems plausible, as the other two players could easily have 3 of either digit combined. Bidding 5 2s is a reasonable step up.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. My hand contains three 9s, one 0, one 1, one 4, one 5, and one 6. I have zero 3s. There are 24 total digits remaining. The previous round revealed the actual count of 3s was 5, making Player 3's current bid of 5 3s plausible. Challenging seems risky given this history and my lack of 3s. Bidding 5 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is supported by the three 9s in my hand. This requires only two more 9s among the remaining 16 digits held by the other two players, which is a reasonable possibility.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the average count for any digit is 2.4. Bidding 5 9s is already a high bid. Given my single 9 and the previous challenges on 9s (which were successful for the bidder at 4 9s), it's possible Player 4 has several 9s. However, bidding higher than 5 9s feels risky with only one 9 in my hand. Challenging 5 9s seems like a reasonable move, as it's above the average and we've seen 4 9s be the actual count twice recently.

Bidding 3 2s seems reasonable, as there are two other players with 8 digits each, and the expected number of 2s across all hands is around 1.6 (16 total digits / 10 possible digits).
