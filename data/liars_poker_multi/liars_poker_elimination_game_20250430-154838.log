Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: No bids yet and I hold two 4s. Across the other 40 digits I expect about 4 more 4s (10% of 40), so bidding 4 4s requires only two others (P≈93%). This is a conservative, plausible opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 68663729, which contains no 4s. The current bid is 4 4s by Player 0. With 48 total digits across 6 players, a bid of 4 4s is plausible as it represents less than 10% of the total digits, and I have none myself. Challenging now seems risky since the bid is not overly high. I will make a higher bid instead. My hand has three 6s, so bidding on 6s seems reasonable. I will bid 5 6s, increasing both the quantity and the digit, to test the waters while staying within a believable range based on my own hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have the hand '40450555', which contains two 5s and no 6s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have information about my own hand, I know I have 2 fives and no sixes. A reasonable next bid could be to increase the digit, so bidding 5 7s is a valid and cautious move as it doesn't require me to believe there's a high number of 7s, just that it's at least as likely as 6s.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 7s and my hand containing 66080084, I notice that increasing the quantity to 6 for any digit would be risky without knowing the distribution of other players' hands. However, I can try to increase the digit value while keeping the quantity the same as the current bid, which is 5. Since my hand does not contain any 7s or higher digits in significant quantities, and given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48, bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity seems like a reasonable strategy. The next higher digit after 7 is 8. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 players, each having 8 digits, it's plausible that there could be at least 5 occurrences of the digit 8 across all players' hands, especially since my hand contains one 8 and I have no information about the other players' hands having a significant number of 8s. Thus, bidding 5 8s seems like a strategic move, increasing the digit value while keeping the quantity the same, making it a higher bid than 5 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s made by Player 3. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than 5 8s. I have the digits 9, 2, 9, 4, 9, 5, 3, 7 in my hand. I can see that bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit is possible. Since I have two 9s, which is a higher digit than 8, I can bid 5 9s as my quantity is the same but my digit is higher.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:1 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. The expected number of 9s in the remaining 40 digits is 4 (40 * 0.1), making the total expected count 5. However, the probability of exactly 5 or more is uncertain. Challenging a high-digit bid like 5 9s is strategic if the likelihood is low, as the bidder may be bluffing. With only one 9 in my hand and no strong evidence to support the bid, challenging is a reasonable risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current round has just started with a total of 40 digits remaining across 5 players. My hand is 92949537, which contains two 9s, one 5, one 4, and the rest are different digits. Since there are no bids yet, I can make an initial bid. I see potential in bidding on the digit 9 since I have two 9s in my hand. Given that there are 5 players and each has 8 digits, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Starting with a conservative bid seems wise. I will bid 2 9s as it's a reasonable starting point given my hand and the total number of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits and a 10% chance per digit, the probability of at least one more 4 among them is about 1–0.9^32 ≈ 96.6%. Bidding 3 4s is a safe increase over 2 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 68663729, which contains two 6s, one 8, one 7, one 3, one 2, and one 9, but no 4s. The current bid is 3 4s by Player 0. Since I have no 4s, I need to assess if 3 4s is likely across all 40 digits. With 5 players and 8 digits each, it's plausible that there are at least 3 4s in total, as each player could have a few. However, I can make a higher bid to keep the game moving. I have two 6s, so bidding 4 6s feels reasonable, increasing both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 3 4s. This bid is within a plausible range given the total digits and my own hand strength for 6s. I’ll avoid challenging since 3 4s doesn’t seem overly aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have the hand '40450555', which contains one 6. This means there are at least 3 more 6s in the other players' hands. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. A higher bid could be either increasing the quantity or keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit. Since I have one 6, I believe there could be more 6s, but bidding more than 5 6s might be too high. However, I can bid 4 7s, which is a valid higher bid because it increases the digit. I'll choose to bid 4 7s as it seems a reasonable and safe next step.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 7s and my hand 66080084, I notice that I have no 7s. However, I also see that bidding higher in quantity is risky given the total digits remaining. Since I have multiple 0s and 8s, and considering the bids made in the previous rounds, I could attempt to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same or slightly higher, but given the constraint of the game and the fact that I don't have a clear advantage in any digit, challenging seems like a safer option. The bid of 4 7s seems reasonable but challenging it could give me an advantage if the actual count is lower than bid, especially since I don't have to reveal my hand. Given the history, players have been somewhat aggressive with their bids, and the fact that we are down to 40 total digits, the likelihood of having exactly 4 or more 7s might be lower than expected, especially considering the distribution of digits in my hand and the bids made so far.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given that I have two 6s in my hand and the current bid is 'None', I need to make a bid that is reasonably high but not overly ambitious. Since I have two 6s, bidding on 6s seems like a good starting point. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 32 and there are 4 players, including myself, the maximum possible count for any digit is 32. However, given the distribution of digits, it's unlikely that any single digit would appear more than 8 times (once per player). Therefore, bidding a moderate quantity for a digit I have in my hand seems prudent. Bidding 4 6s would be a safe start, as it gives room for other players to bid higher and allows me to potentially win if others are cautious.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 3. I have one 6 in my hand. Given that there are 3 other active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total possible count for any digit is 32. The bid of 4 6s seems plausible but not extremely high. I should consider if I can make a valid higher bid or challenge. Since I only have one 6, I don't have enough information to confidently make a higher bid. However, I can try to make a slightly higher bid by increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 5 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold one 6 in my eight digits, so Player 4 needs at least four more 6s among the 24 other cards. Under uniform random distribution, the chance of four or more sixes in 24 cards is only about 21%, making the bid unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my turn as Player 4. I have the hand 92949537. I should make a conservative bid to start, considering my hand and the total digits remaining. I have two 9s and two 6s. Bidding 2 9s seems like a reasonable starting point as it reflects my hand and leaves room for others to bid higher or challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s made by Player 4. In my hand, I have one 9, which means there is at least one 9 in the total count. With 24 total digits across three players, a bid of 2 9s is quite low and likely achievable, but I need to make a higher bid. I have three 6s in my hand, which is a strong count for that digit. Bidding 3 9s increases the quantity and keeps the digit, which is a reasonable escalation based on my single 9 and the possibility of more in other hands. Alternatively, I could bid on 6s, but since 6s were heavily bid on in previous rounds (up to 5 6s), it might be riskier. I'll go with 3 9s to stay safe and push the bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 9s' by Player 1 and considering my hand '66080084', I notice I have no 9s. With a total of 24 digits remaining across all players and the bid being on 9s, I must assess the likelihood of there being at least 3 nines. Since each player has 8 digits, the maximum number of any single digit across all players is 24 (if all players had the same digit, which is not possible since we have different bids and hands). Given the history of bids and challenges, it seems players have been cautious with their bids, and challenges have been successful when the bid seemed too high. Considering the total number of digits and the fact that I have no 9s, and given that we are down to 3 players, I should challenge this bid as it seems unlikely there are 3 nines among the remaining digits, especially since previous bids and challenges suggest a mix of digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: Since it's the start of a new round with no current bid, I need to make an opening bid. My hand is 68663729, which gives me three 6s, two 8s, and one each of 2, 3, 7, and 9. With only 16 total digits remaining across two players, I should start with a conservative bid. Bidding 3 6s is reasonable since I already have three 6s in my hand, making it a safe bet even if Player 4 has none. This also sets a moderate threshold for the next bid.
