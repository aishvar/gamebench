Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round. My hand (56402716) contains two 6s, which is the most frequent digit I hold. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits. The statistical average for any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8. Since I have two 6s, the expected number of 6s across all hands is roughly 2 (my hand) + (40 remaining digits / 10) = 6. Bidding '5 6s' is a reasonable opening bid, slightly above the simple average but justified by my holding two 6s and the overall expected count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '5 6s'. Looking at my hand (78774921), I have zero 6s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. Player 0 is claiming there are at least 5 sixes among all players. Since I have none, all 5+ would need to be in the other 5 players' hands (40 digits total). This is certainly possible, as it only requires about 12.5% of the remaining digits to be 6s. However, since I have no 6s myself, I could bid '5 7s' (I have three 7s in my hand, so I'm confident there are at least 5 total). This increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 7s in my hand, and with 48 total digits across 6 players, having 5 7s seems unlikely. While it's possible other players have multiple 7s, my hand having none makes it less probable. Additionally, being early in the game with many players still active, this is a good opportunity to challenge without risking too much information being revealed about my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding in this round. Looking at my hand (78774921), I have three 7s. With 5 active players each having 8 digits, there are 40 total digits in play. If the distribution of digits were completely random, we'd expect about 4 of each digit (40 digits รท 10 possible values). Since I already have three 7s, it's reasonable to assume there might be at least 2 more 7s among the other players' hands. A conservative opening bid would be 5 7s, which I've already seen in my hand plus just 2 more across all other players. This is a strategic opening that's based on what I know I have while not being too aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s made by Player 1. My hand (22031841) contains zero 7s. With 5 players remaining and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. For the bid of 5 7s to be true, the other 4 players (holding 32 digits) must collectively have at least five 7s. The expected number of 7s in 32 random digits is 3.2. The probability of having 5 or more 7s in 32 digits is relatively low (approximately 19.5%). This makes the bid likely false from my perspective (around 80.5% probability). While Player 1 won a challenge on 5 7s in the previous round, the number of total digits has decreased, and my hand contributes zero 7s, significantly reducing the probability of the bid being true compared to the previous round. Challenging is the statistically favored move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I'm starting this round with my hand containing 78774921. I have three 7s, two 9s, one 8, one 4, and one 1. Since I'm Player 1 and it's my turn to start bidding, I should make a strategic first bid. In previous rounds, I successfully bid 5 7s twice, and the actual count was 6 both times. Since I still have three 7s in my hand, and 7s were abundant in previous rounds, it makes sense to start with a bid on 7s. With 32 total digits in play and 3 of them being 7s in my hand, a conservative estimate would be around 6-8 total 7s. I'll bid 6 7s to start.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Player 1 bid 6 7s. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit value. Challenging seems risky as there are still 32 digits remaining, and there could be multiple 7s among the other players' hands.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have two 8s in my hand, and I know that at least 6 7s exist across all hands. Bidding 7 8s seems reasonable because it increases both the quantity and the digit, and I have some confidence in the existence of 8s based on my hand. I will bid 7 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 8s, which is quite high. I have one '8' in my hand. Considering there are 32 digits total, having at least 7 eights is possible but somewhat risky. The next valid bid must be higher than 7 8s, meaning at least 8 0s or 8 1s, etc. I have no '0's or '1's in my hand, so bidding 8 0s or 8 1s would be a blind overbid. Bidding 7 9s is not allowed since the quantity must increase or the digit must be higher if the quantity is the same, and 7 9s is not higher than 7 8s in quantity but higher in digit, so it is allowed. However, I have no '9's in my hand. Bidding 7 9s is possible but risky. Alternatively, I can bid 8 0s, which is higher quantity but I have no '0's. Given the high bid and my weak hand for higher digits, I believe this bid is aggressive and likely to be challenged soon. I will challenge the current bid to try to eliminate Player 4.

Player 5 Reasoning: No bids have been made yet. I have the digits 5, 3, 0, 1, 4, 7, 5, and 6 in my hand. Considering the previous bids and challenges, bidding 3 5s is reasonable since I hold two 5s and 3 is a moderate starting quantity that can be believable across all players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand (56402716). For the bid to be true, the other two players (Player 1 and Player 5) need to have at least two 5s combined among their 16 digits. This is plausible (expected number is 1.6). Challenging such a low bid seems risky. I have two 6s in my hand, which is my strongest digit. Bidding based on my strength is a good strategy. A bid of 3 6s would be very safe (only needs one more 6 from 16 digits). A bid of 4 6s requires two more 6s from the 16 unknown digits, which is statistically likely (expected 1.6) and puts more pressure on the next player. I will make the slightly more aggressive but still well-supported bid of 4 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (78774921), I have zero 6s. Player 0 has bid 4 6s, which means they believe there are at least 4 sixes among all players. Since I have none, that means Player 0 and Player 5 would need to have at least 4 sixes between them. Each player has 8 digits, so it's possible, but I should consider if it's likely. I've been successful with 7s in previous rounds (having 3 sevens in my hand), but I need to make a higher bid than 4 6s. I could bid 4 7s (same quantity, higher digit) or 5 of something. Given my hand has 3 sevens, bidding 5 7s would mean there need to be 2 more sevens between the other players, which is reasonable. Alternatively, I could challenge, but since Player 0 might have several 6s, and it's a relatively low bid (only 4 out of 24 possible digits), challenging seems risky.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity to 5 or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 is a significant jump, and I only have one 7, so that might be risky. Instead, I can bid 4 8s, which is higher than 4 7s by digit, and I don't have any 8s, but it's a reasonable increment. Bidding 4 8s puts pressure on the next player without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s, made by Player 5. There are 3 players and 24 total digits. My hand (56402716) contains zero 8s. For the bid of 4 8s to be true, the other two players (Player 1 and Player 5) must collectively hold at least four 8s within their 16 digits. The expected number of 8s in those 16 digits is 16/10 = 1.6. Requiring 4 or more 8s from those 16 digits is statistically unlikely, especially since I hold none. Player 5 jumped from 3 5s to 4 8s, skipping over 6s and 7s which were bid, potentially indicating a bluff or a specific hand composition. Given I have no 8s to support the bid, challenging seems like the most strategically sound move.

Player 0 Reasoning: It's the start of a new round with only two players (me and Player 1) and 16 total digits. I am Player 0 and need to make the opening bid. My hand is 56402716. I have two 6s, which is my most frequent digit. The expected number of any digit across the 16 total digits is 1.6. Having two 6s myself makes it statistically likely that there are at least three 6s in total (my two plus potentially one or more from Player 1). Bidding '3 6s' is a safe but informative opening bid based on my strongest digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. I have 8 digits in my hand: 78774921. Looking at my hand, I have zero 6s. The current bid from Player 0 is '3 6s', meaning they're claiming there are at least 3 sixes between our combined hands. Since I have zero 6s, this would mean Player 0 would need to have at least 3 sixes in their hand. This is possible but not guaranteed. Given that there are only 16 total digits in play (8 for each player), having 3 of the same digit is somewhat high but still reasonable. Looking at my own hand, I have three 7s, which gives me a strong position to bid on 7s. I could bid '3 7s', which would be higher than '3 6s' because 7 > 6 with the same quantity. This is a safe bid since I know I have three 7s myself.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 56402716. I have two 6s and one 7. The current bid from Player 1 is 3 7s. There are 16 total digits (8 for me, 8 for Player 1). For the current bid of 3 7s to be true, Player 1 must have at least two 7s (since I have one). While possible, especially given Player 1's history of bidding 7s, challenging feels risky without more information. A better option is to make a bid based on my hand strength. I have two 6s. I previously bid 3 6s this round. Increasing the bid to 4 6s is a logical next step, leveraging my known digits. This requires Player 1 to have at least two 6s for the bid to be true, which seems plausible. Bidding 4 6s puts the pressure back on Player 1 to either challenge or bid higher, likely forcing them towards 4 7s (requiring three 7s from them) or into the 5s quantity.

Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (78774921), I have 0 sixes. Player 0 has bid 4 6s, claiming there are at least 4 sixes between our hands. Since I have 0 sixes, this would mean Player 0 has at least 4 sixes in their hand. While it's possible they have 4 or more sixes, it seems unlikely that they would have that many of a single digit in an 8-digit hand. Additionally, I notice I have 3 sevens in my hand, which supports my previous bid of 3 7s. Given that I know with certainty there are 0 sixes in my hand, and the probability of Player 0 having 4 or more sixes in their 8-digit hand is relatively low, I should challenge their bid.
