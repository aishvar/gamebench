Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand (47902329), I have: one 0, one 1, one 2 (twice), one 3 (twice), one 4, one 7, one 9. Since I have two 2s and two 3s in my hand, these are good candidates for my bid. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. Assuming uniform distribution, each digit would appear about 4.8 times on average. Since I have two 3s already, it's reasonable to estimate there might be around 5-7 total 3s across all hands. I'll start with a conservative bid of 5 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 6 3s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same, which is a valid move in Liar's Poker. I also have no reason to believe that the current bid is invalid, so challenging is not a good strategy at this point.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s by Player 1. I hold three 8s, so bidding 6 8s (same quantity, higher digit) is legal. I would then only need three more 8s among the other 40 cards, which is plausible under a roughly uniform distribution.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. With 40 total digits, the expected number of 8s is about 4, and the probability of at least two more 8s among the 32 unknown cards is roughly 84.5%, making an opening bid of 5 8s a strong yet plausible start.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand, making 2s a strong candidate for a bid. Bidding 6 2s is a valid higher bid than 5 8s (due to increased quantity) and leverages my knowledge of my own hand. Challenging 5 8s carries risk since the previous round confirmed 6 8s existed, and Player 3's elimination may not have removed all of them.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 25580474, which contains two 5s, one 2, one 8, one 0, one 4, and one 7. The current bid is 6 2s by Player 4. I only have one 2 in my hand, which means I contribute very little to the total count of 2s. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, an average distribution would suggest about 4 of each digit across all hands. A bid of 6 2s is slightly above average but not extreme. However, considering the previous round had a successful bid of 6 8s, it's possible that some digits are clustering. I could bid higher, such as 6 5s, since I have two 5s in my hand, which would be a safer bid for me. Alternatively, I could challenge, but since 6 2s is not an outrageous bid given the total digits, challenging might be risky. I’ll choose to bid 6 5s to stay in the game and leverage my own hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. There are 5 active players with 8 digits each, for a total of 40 digits. The current bid is '6 5s' made by Player 5. Looking at my hand (47902329), I have zero 5s. This means that for the bid of '6 5s' to be true, the other 4 players must have at least 6 fives among them, averaging 1.5 fives per player. This is possible but not guaranteed. In the previous round, Player 2's bid of '6 8s' was challenged and turned out to be exactly correct, which suggests players might be making accurate bids. I could bid '7 5s', but since I have no 5s myself, this feels risky. I could also increase the digit and bid something like '6 6s', '6 7s', etc., but I don't have many of these digits either (no 6s, one 7). Looking at my hand, I have two 2s and two 9s, which are my strongest digits. I'll bid '7 2s' since I have two 2s myself, making it more likely that there are at least 7 twos total among all players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. While I could make a bid, the risk of being challenged is high. Given that there are only 40 digits remaining and 5 players, including myself, it's reasonable to assume there might be 7 2s. However, the bid history shows that high bids on 8s have been made and won, suggesting that 8s are more common. Therefore, challenging the current bid seems like a safer move, as it's unlikely that there are exactly 7 2s remaining.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of this round. Looking at my hand (47902329), I have two 2s, two 9s, and one each of 4, 7, 0, and 3. Since I have two 2s in my hand, and I know from the previous round that there were 8 total 2s when there were 5 players, it's likely there are still several 2s among the other players. In the previous round, Player 4 bid 6 2s, suggesting they might have some 2s as well. Starting with a conservative but strategic bid based on my knowledge would be reasonable. I'll bid 5 2s, which is a safe starting point given what I know.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand and there are 24 unknown digits. The expected total number of 2s is about 3.4, making a bid of 5 twos highly improbable (P≈22%). It’s very unlikely Player 0’s bid is valid, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding in this round with 3 players (including myself). Looking at my hand (47902329), I have two 2s, two 9s, one 0, one 3, one 4, and one 7. Since I have two 2s in my hand, and 2s have been relatively common in previous rounds (there were 7 2s in a previous round with 4 players), starting with a bid of 5 2s seems reasonable. I know there are 24 total digits in play, and I have 2 of the 2s, so I'm estimating there could be around 3 more 2s between the other two players. This is a conservative opening bid that gives me room to maneuver later.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. The current bid of 5 2s seems likely given the history of high 2 counts in previous rounds. Bidding 6 2s leverages my own high count of 2s and raises the stakes appropriately.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 25580474, which contains two 5s and one 2. The current bid is 6 2s by Player 4. With a total of 24 digits across three players, a bid of 6 2s means that on average, each player would have about two 2s. Since I only have one 2, it’s possible that the other players have enough 2s to make the bid valid, especially given past rounds where the count of 2s was as high as 8 when there were more players. However, I’m not confident enough to challenge as the risk of elimination is high if I’m wrong. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. Since I have two 5s, bidding 6 5s feels reasonable as it increases the digit while maintaining the quantity, and I contribute a fair share to the count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (47902329), I have zero 5s. The current bid is 6 5s from Player 5. With 24 total digits in play and 8 in my hand, there are 16 digits in the other players' hands. For the bid to be valid, there would need to be 6 fives among those 16 digits. That means at least 6/16 = 37.5% of their digits would need to be 5s, which is quite high but not impossible. However, given that I have zero 5s in my hand, and the proportion needed in the remaining hands is high, I think challenging is the better option. If I were to bid, I'd need to go to at least 7 5s or 6 6s, which seems risky given what I know about my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: I'm starting the final round against Player 4. Looking at my hand (47902329), I have two 2s, two 9s, one 7, one 4, one 3, and one 0. Since I'm making the first bid, I should bid based on what I know for certain - the digits in my hand. Bidding on 2s seems reasonable since I have two of them, and 2s have been common in previous rounds. I'll start with a conservative bid of 3 2s, suggesting there's at least one more 2 in Player 4's hand, which is reasonable given how common 2s have been in previous rounds.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. The current bid of 3 2s is exactly the minimum possible count (assuming Player 0 has none). Challenging would risk losing since the total could be exactly 3. Bidding 4 2s increases the quantity while staying on the same digit, leveraging my strong holding of 2s and forcing Player 0 to either escalate further or challenge a bid that may be difficult to confirm.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand (47902329). With 16 total digits in play, I need to determine if there are likely to be at least 4 twos total. Since I have 1, Player 4 would need at least 3 twos in their hand for their bid to be valid. The probability of Player 4 having exactly 3 or more twos in 8 random digits is not extremely low. Looking at previous rounds, there were 7 twos in a previous round with 4 players (32 digits), and 5 twos in another round with 3 players (24 digits). This suggests twos are reasonably common. I could bid 5 2s, but that would be risky. I could also switch to another digit, like 4 3s, 4 4s, etc. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, which gives me confidence. I'll bid 4 9s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. My hand contains no 9s, so all four 9s would need to be in Player 0's hand. With 16 total digits remaining (8 in Player 0's hand), it's possible but not certain. However, Player 0's bid of 4 9s comes after a prior bid on 2s, where I have three 2s. This suggests Player 0 may be bluffing on 9s to avoid engaging further on 2s. Given the high risk of elimination, challenging seems justified since the bid requires Player 0 to hold exactly four 9s, which feels unlikely without supporting evidence from prior bids.
