Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', which means I can make any initial bid. I have 8 secret digits in my hand: 1, 9, 6, 8, 5, 6, 4, 6. I notice I have three 6s. Making a bid of '3 6s' seems reasonable as it's based on my own hand and sets a starting point for the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. My hand contains two 7s. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is well supported by my hand, requiring only one additional 7 from the remaining 32 digits among other players. This seems like a safe and reasonable move given the expected distribution of digits.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have a 9 in my hand. I can safely increase the digit to 9 since I don't have any 7s, and the maximum quantity for any digit is 40. My hand also has 8 and 0, so I can increase the quantity to 4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 88708511, which contains no 9s. The current bid is 4 9s by Player 3. With 5 players and 40 total digits, it's possible but not highly likely that there are at least 4 9s across all hands, as that would mean an average of almost 1 per player for a specific digit. However, since I have none, I estimate the likelihood is lower. I could challenge, but it's safer to bid higher. I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding 5 8s feels reasonable as I contribute to the count, and it increases the quantity from 4 to 5 while switching digits. Alternatively, I could bid 5 0s or higher, but since 8 is already in my hand, Iâ€™ll stick with that for now.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. My hand contains one 8. The expected number of 8s across all players is 4 (40 digits * 10% = 4). A bid of 5 exceeds this expectation, making it statistically unlikely. Challenging this bid offers a reasonable chance of success if the actual count is less than 5, which aligns with expected probabilities.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet in this round and I am starting the bidding, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand is 88708511, which contains three 8s and two 1s as the most frequent digits. With 32 total digits across all players, bidding on a digit I have a decent count of is a safe strategy. I will bid 4 8s, as I already have three 8s, and it's plausible that at least one more 8 exists among the other 24 digits. This bid is not too aggressive and leaves room for others to raise or challenge if they think it's unlikely.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 4. I have the hand 19685646, which contains one 8. Given that there are 32 total digits remaining across all players and each player has 8 digits, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. The bid of 4 8s seems plausible but not extremely high. However, without information on other players' hands, I must make an educated guess. I can increase the quantity or the digit to make a valid higher bid. Bidding 5 8s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:1 - openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand. With 32 total digits, the average count for any digit is 3.2. A bid of 5 is above average. However, in the previous round, a bid of 5 8s was challenged and the actual count was 7. This suggests that high counts of 8s are possible. Furthermore, Player 4 started this round bidding on 8s (4 8s) and Player 1 raised it (5 8s), indicating they may hold 8s. Given this history, challenging 5 8s seems risky despite my hand lacking 8s. My best option is to make a higher bid. To bid higher than 5 8s, I must either increase the quantity (to 6 or more) or keep the quantity at 5 and increase the digit (to 9). Increasing the quantity to 6 requires a high count of a specific digit. I have two 0s, one 2, one 4, two 7s, and two 9s. Bidding 6 of any digit I hold two of (0s, 7s, 9s) would require at least 4 more from the other 24 digits (average 2.4), which is unlikely. Bidding 5 9s, based on the two 9s in my hand, requires needing 3 more 9s from the other 24 digits (average 2.4). This is more plausible than needing 4+ for a bid of 6. Therefore, bidding 5 9s is the most reasonable next move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have 8 in my hand, which is a 9. I can bid 6 9s, increasing both quantity and digit, as it seems reasonable based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:2 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 88708511, which contains two 8s and no 9s. The current bid is 6 9s by Player 3. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 6 9s means roughly 19% of all digits need to be 9s, which is plausible but on the higher side for a specific digit. Since I have no 9s in my hand, the other three players would need to contribute all 6 9s, averaging 2 per player, which is possible but not guaranteed. Bidding higher, such as 7 9s, feels too risky without any 9s in my hand, as it increases the required count further. I could bid 6 0s to switch digits, but without knowing the distribution, it's a gamble. Given the moderate likelihood of 6 9s and my lack of 9s, challenging seems like a reasonable option to test the bid, especially since the risk of elimination is balanced against potentially eliminating Player 3 if the count is less than 6.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round with no current bid to beat, I can start with a conservative bid. My hand is 88708511, which gives me three 8s, two 1s, and one each of 0, 5, and 7. Since I have a strong count of 8s, I will bid based on that. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable starting point, as I already have three 8s, and it's likely that at least one more 8 exists among the other 16 digits held by Player 1 and Player 2. This bid also sets a moderate threshold for the next players while protecting me from an early challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 4. I have the hand 19685646, which contains one 8. Given that there are only 24 digits in total and three active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. The bid of 4 8s seems high but not impossible. However, I don't have enough information to be certain it's a lie. I should bid higher to test the validity of the claim or challenge if I think it's unlikely. Since my goal is to either make a valid higher bid or challenge, I will make a higher bid. I will bid 5 9s as it is a higher quantity and my hand contains a 9.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s by Player 1. My hand contains two 9s. With 24 total digits, a bid of 5 9s is significant, suggesting Player 1 likely holds a good number of 9s. Challenging feels risky as it's plausible the total count of 9s is 5 or more. I must make a higher bid. The lowest possible higher quantity is 6. My hand contains two 0s, two 7s, and two 9s. Bidding 6 of any digit is speculative, requiring 4 more of that digit from the remaining 16 cards. Bidding 6 0s is a valid higher bid based on a digit I possess, shifting the focus from 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 88708511, which contains two 8s, two 1s, and one each of 0, 5, and 7. The current bid is 6 0s by Player 2. I have one 0 in my hand, so I know at least one 0 exists. With 24 total digits across three players, a bid of 6 0s means that the other two players would need to have at least 5 more 0s combined for the bid to hold. This seems somewhat plausible given I have no information about their hands, but it's on the higher side. I could challenge, but the risk is significant as I only know of one 0. Instead, I can make a safer bid. Since I have two 8s, and the bid structure allows increasing the digit or quantity, Iâ€™ll bid 6 1s, as itâ€™s a higher digit than 0 with the same quantity, and I have two 1s in my hand, making it somewhat believable. This keeps me in the game without taking the immediate risk of a challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s made by Player 4. I have 2 ones in my hand. Given that there are only 24 digits in total and 3 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. I need to assess if bidding higher is reasonable or if challenging is more strategic. Since my hand contains two 1s, and assuming the other players have a reasonable distribution, bidding higher seems risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding 7 2s or higher quantity of a higher digit than 1 could be strategic, but I must ensure my bid is valid and higher. Challenging seems tempting but I must calculate the risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 2s, made by Player 1. There are 3 players remaining with 8 digits each, totaling 24 digits. The average expected count for any digit is 2.4 (24 / 10). A bid of 7 is significantly higher than the average, suggesting it's a high-risk bid unless Player 1 holds a substantial number of 2s. I have only one 2 in my hand. For the bid to be true, the other two players must collectively hold at least 6 2s. While possible, this is unlikely given the expected distribution. Bidding higher than 7 2s would require an even larger quantity or a higher digit at the same quantity (7 3s or more). My hand (72040979) does not strongly support a bid of 7 or more for any other digit (max count is 2 for 0s, 7s, and 9s). Making an even higher bid would be very speculative and likely lead to me being challenged on a weak bid. Challenging the current high bid puts the pressure back on Player 1, who made the aggressive bid. Given the statistical improbability of 7 or more 2s in 24 digits (relative to average), challenging is the most strategic move.

Player 2 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round. My hand is 72040979, which contains two 0s, one 2, one 4, two 7s, and two 9s. With 16 total digits across two players, bidding 3 of a digit I have two of (like 0, 7, or 9) is a strong and plausible opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 88708511, so I have no 0s. The current bid by Player 2 is 3 0s, meaning they are claiming there are at least three 0s across our combined 16 digits. Since I have none, all three would need to be in Player 2's hand for the bid to be true, which is possible but not highly likely given the distribution of digits. However, challenging at this low bid level is risky as it's quite plausible they have at least three 0s. Instead, I can make a safer bid based on my strong count of 8s. I have three 8s, so bidding 4 8s is reasonable, assuming Player 2 might have at least one 8. This increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 3 0s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 4. My hand (72040979) contains zero 8s. This means for the bid to be true, Player 4 must have at least four 8s in their 8 digits. The probability of a player having 4 or more of a specific digit in a hand of 8 is very low (approximately 0.5% assuming random distribution). Given how unlikely it is for Player 4 to hold that many 8s, challenging this bid is the most strategic move.
