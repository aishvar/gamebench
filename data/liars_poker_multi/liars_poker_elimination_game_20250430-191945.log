Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. With 48 total digits and 8 in my hand, there are 40 unknown digits; the expected count for any digit among those is about 4. Since I hold two 2s, it is very likely there's at least one more among the other players. Opening with a bid of 3 twos is a safe, reasonable start.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s made by Player 0. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move since it increases both the quantity and the digit, leveraging the digits in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s, which is below the average expected count (4.8) of any digit across all hands. Bidding 4 7s leverages my own 7s and the statistical likelihood that the total number of 7s (expected ~4.8) meets or exceeds 4, making it a safer higher bid than challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have the hand 30533786, which contains one 8 and three 3s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I see an 8 in my hand, it's plausible that there are at least 4 8s across all hands. I can bid on a higher digit to make a valid bid. Bidding 4 9s is a valid move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 4 9s, which means there would need to be at least three more 9s among the other five players' hands (total of 40 digits). Given that 9s are less common and the bid is already at 4, it's unlikely there are that many 9s. Challenging seems like the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is None, and I am the first to bid in this round. Looking at my hand (63878136), I have two 6s, one 3, two 7s, two 8s, and one 1. A reasonable starting bid would be based on the digit I have the most of, which is 6s, 7s, and 8s (each with two in my hand). Since 6 is the lowest of these, I'll start with a bid on 6s to leave room for others to bid higher. A bid of 2 6s is too low given previous bids in the last round started at 3, so I'll bid 3 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 4 8s is strictly higher than 3 6s (higher quantity) and I only need at least two more 8s among the 32 unseen digits. With an expected 3.2 8s and a high probability of at least two, this bid is reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have three 6s in my hand, and there are 40 digits remaining. Bidding 5 6s increases the quantity and uses a digit I have in my hand, making it a reasonable bid. Challenging seems risky because Player 0 might have the 8s to support their bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 5 6s. Bidding 5 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages my personal holdings of 7s. This bid is strategically sound as it builds on my visible information while maintaining pressure on opponents.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 5 8s, which seems high but possible given there are 40 digits in play. However, with only two 8s in my hand and considering the previous bids, it's unlikely there are five 8s in total. I should challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. Raising the bid from 1 0s to 2 2s is a valid increase in quantity and leverages the two 2s I hold, making it a safe bid given the expected distribution of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: You have three 6s in your hand. The current bid is 2 2s, which is relatively low. Since you have three 6s, it's reasonable to bid 4 6s, increasing both the quantity and the digit. This bid is also supported by the previous bidding history, where 4 6s was previously accepted.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand (digits: 0,7,2,7,2,4,1,5). Since the current bid is 4 6s and I have no 6s, challenging would risk elimination if the actual count meets or exceeds 4. Bidding 4 7s (same quantity, higher digit) is a logical next step based on my two 7s and the need to escalate the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no zeros, and the chance of at least one zero among the 16 unknown cards is high (~82%), so challenging 1 0s is too risky. I hold two '2's, so raising to 2 2s is a safe bid—if challenged I’m guaranteed at least two.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have three 6s in my hand, and we have seen 3 6s and 5 6s bids in the previous rounds, which suggests that there could be at least 5 6s in total. Bidding 6 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand and the previous bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s. Since I have three 6s, I can confidently bid 3 6s, which is a higher bid than 2 8s. Additionally, there have been successful high bids on 6s in previous rounds, suggesting that bidding on 6s could be a strong strategy. Challenging seems risky because Player 0 might have one or two 8s, and I only have one 8.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have only one 6 in my hand. The bid of 3 6s requires Player 1 to have at least two 6s in their eight digits, which only occurs about 19% of the time. Challenging now gives me roughly an 81% chance to win the round and eliminate them.
