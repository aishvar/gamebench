Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 3 3s seems reasonable, as it's likely there's at least one more 3 among the other players' hands given 5 opponents and 48 total digits. Starting with a moderate bid based on my own holdings.

Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 3 4s and I have two 6s in my hand, I should consider increasing either the quantity or the digit to make a valid higher bid. Since I don't have any 4s or higher digits in significant quantities, and considering the total number of digits remaining is 48, bidding on a higher digit seems reasonable. I notice I have multiple 6s, which could indicate a higher presence of 6s among all players. Thus, bidding on 6s could be a strategic move, especially since it directly increases the digit value from the current bid of 4s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. It's unlikely that the total count of 6s is much higher than the current bid. Challenging seems like a good move, as it's risky for the bidder to have overstated the count of 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None' and I'm starting the bidding, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 54726604, I notice I have multiple occurrences of the digit '6'. Since the goal is to make a valid higher bid and considering the total number of digits remaining is 40, bidding on a digit I have the most of seems strategic. I have two '6's in my hand, which is a good starting point. However, considering the need to make a bid that is reasonable yet challenging for others to surpass, I'll bid on the '6' but start with a lower quantity to avoid overestimating and to encourage the game to continue.

Player 4 Reasoning: I hold three 3s in my own hand (digits: 13321365). The current bid is 2 6s, which is almost certainly true, so challenging is unwise. To legally outbid it I can raise the quantity. By bidding 3 3s, I increase the quantity from 2 to 3. Because I already possess all three 3s myself, the bid is guaranteed to be satisfied, making it a very safe move.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have two 3s in my hand (positions 2 and 4). Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can either increase the quantity to 4 or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit. I don't have many 3s, but I do have one 9, which is a higher digit. Bidding 3 9s is a valid and reasonable next bid, as it is higher than 3 3s, and I have one 9 in my hand, making the bid plausible.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Given the previous rounds where 3s were a common digit (e.g., a challenged bid of 4 3s had an actual count of 8 in a larger player pool), bidding 3 3s seems reasonable. With 32 total digits remaining, a bid of 3 for a digit I already hold two of aligns with the likelihood of at least one additional 3 existing among the other three players.

Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 3s by Player 0 and considering my hand has 54726604, I notice that I have two 6s and no 3s. Since the bid must be strictly higher than the current one, I could either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. However, with only 32 total digits remaining and the fact that I have two 6s, bidding on 6s seems like a good strategy. I also have to consider the possibility of challenging, but given that I have information about my own hand and the previous bids, making a strategic bid seems more appealing. Increasing the quantity while keeping a reasonable digit or choosing a higher digit with the same quantity could be viable. Considering my hand and the need to make a higher bid, I could bid on a higher quantity of a digit I have or a higher digit itself if I feel it's likely to be present in other players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I already hold three 3s. In the last round, the table revealed a surprisingly high total of eight 3s out of 40 digits, suggesting that 3s may be running hot overall. The current bid of 4 6s could very well be correct (I myself have one 6), so challenging carries roughly a one-third chance of knocking me out. A safer path is to leverage my strong count of 3s and raise the quantity: bidding 5 3s only requires two more 3s among the 24 unknown digits, which is better than a 60% chance given a uniform distribution and likely even higher considering the earlier data. This keeps me in the game while putting pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have two 3s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid. However, since the bid is already at quantity 5, I must either bid at least 6 of any digit or 5 of a higher digit. I have one 9, which is the highest digit in my hand. Bidding 5 9s seems risky because I only have one 9, and the total count may not support it. Bidding 6 of any digit is a safer increment. I do not have many of any other digit, but 6 0s is the lowest digit with higher quantity. I don't have zeros, so bidding 6 3s or 6 6s or 6 9s is possible but risky. Since the previous bid of 5 3s is plausible and I do not have strong evidence to challenge, I will raise the bid to 6 3s, increasing quantity while keeping the same digit, which is a valid and reasonable move.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid of 6 3s requires at least four more 3s across the remaining three players (24 digits). Statistically, the expected number of 3s in those 24 digits is ~2.4, making the total required count (6) unlikely. Previous rounds also showed variance, but the mathematical expectation supports challenging.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have the digits 3, 8, 9, 0, 9, 3, 5, 6 in my hand, including two 3s and two 9s. Since no bids have been made this round, I want to start with a bid that reflects a reasonable quantity of a digit I hold. Bidding '2 3s' is possible but low and might be easily outbid. I can start with '3 3s' which is a moderate bid and reasonable given the previous rounds where 3s were common. This sets a solid baseline and pressures others.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 3s by Player 5 and considering my hand contains 54726604, I notice I have two 6s but no 3s. Since the current bid is low and my hand does not support a higher bid on 3s, I should consider bidding on a different digit that I have in abundance or challenge if the current bid seems unlikely. However, with 24 total digits remaining and the bid being 3 3s, it's not extremely high. I have to decide whether to increase the quantity or the digit. Given that I don't have any 3s, increasing the digit seems more reasonable. Since my hand has two 6s and no other digit appears more than twice, bidding on 6s could be strategic. The previous round had a bid of 3 3s, and considering the total digits remaining, a bid slightly higher than the current, focusing on a digit I have, seems like a good strategy. Therefore, bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand and the game's progression.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand. Historically, 3s have shown up frequently (8 out of 40 and 7 out of 32 in earlier rounds), so expecting at least two more 3s among the 16 unseen digits is very plausible. Challenging 4 6s is risky—I only have one 6 and Player 2 often bids on 6s, suggesting they may hold several themselves. Rather than take the roughly coin-flip chance of a challenge, I’ll leverage my strong position in 3s and raise the quantity, making a believable but harder-to-challenge bid.

To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 5 and increase the digit. Increasing the quantity to 6 for digit 3 seems risky given my hand and the total digits. However, bidding 5 4s is a valid higher bid and reasonable since I have one 4 in my hand, making it plausible.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. Given my hand contains two 6s and a 4, and considering the bidding history, I should try to make a reasonable bid that takes into account the total number of digits remaining and the likelihood of certain digits appearing. Since the current bid is 5 4s and I have one 4 in my hand, I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. Given that there are 24 total digits remaining and the bid of 5 4s seems plausible, especially since I have one 4, I should consider bidding on a digit that I have knowledge of. However, I must also consider the maximum possible quantity for any digit, which is 24, and the fact that bidding too high could lead to a challenge. With my two 6s, bidding on 6s seems like a good strategy, but I must ensure my bid is higher than the current bid of 5 4s. Since I have two 6s, and given the history of bids, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Considering the risk of challenging and the potential for a higher bid, I decide to make a bid that increases the quantity, taking into account my knowledge of the game and the digits in my hand.

With a uniform distribution that outcome occurs well under 5 % of the time, and even the earlier aggressive 4-bids make it unlikely both opponents jointly reach six.

Because the a-priori chance of there being three or more 3s across two random hands is fairly low, the bid may tempt them to challenge and lose.

To raise the bid, I must bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Bidding 6 3s seems risky without more '3's in my hand. I have two '9's, which might allow me to bid 5 9s, which is higher than 5 3s. Bidding 5 9s is a valid increase and could pressure the opponent. Therefore, I will bid 5 9s.
