Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, so I know for certain there are at least two 7s among all players. The current bid is 2 5s. By keeping the quantity at 2 and raising the digit to 7, I make a higher bid that is guaranteed to be correct if challenged.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. My hand is 34226493, which contains one 9. Bidding 2 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit than 2 7s). This bid is plausible as I only need one additional 9 among the remaining 40 digits across the other 5 players. It's a low-risk bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 9s'. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits. The expected number of any digit is 4.8. I have one 9 in my hand. For the bid to be false, there would need to be fewer than two 9s in total across all 48 digits. Since I hold one 9, this means no other player could have a 9. This is statistically very unlikely with 40 digits remaining among the other 5 players. Therefore, challenging '2 9s' is highly risky. I should make a higher bid. A higher bid must be at least '3 0s'. My hand is 64691722. I have two 2s and two 6s. Bidding '3 2s' is a safe and logical next step, increasing the quantity by one and using a digit I hold multiple copies of. It keeps the bidding low.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 14501507. I have two 0s, two 1s, zero 2s, one 4, two 5s, zero 6s, one 7, zero 8s, and zero 9s. The current bid is 3 2s. I have zero 2s in my hand, making it less likely that the total count of 2s is 3 or more. However, challenging with zero 2s is risky if other players have several. Bidding higher is generally safer early in the game. I have two 5s. Bidding 3 5s is a valid higher bid and is plausible given my hand and the number of players. Bidding 3 3s or higher digits with quantity 3 are also valid, but I have no 3s, so 3 5s is a better choice based on my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. My hand contains a 6 and a 7. Bidding 3 7s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages the higher digit (7 > 6) without needing to assume others' hands, as the bid remains within plausible ranges.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, so the current bid of 3 7s almost certainly succeeds (only one more 7 is needed among the remaining 40 unknown digits). Challenging would likely eliminate me. A safe way to stay in the game is to raise the quantity by one while keeping the same digit I already have support for.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have zero 7s in my hand. While challenging is an option since I know my count is 0, 4 7s is not an extremely high bid given there are 6 players (average expectation for any digit is 4.8). I have two 2s in my hand. Bidding 5 2s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and seems plausible as I hold 2 of them, meaning only 3 more are needed from the other 5 players (40 digits). This is a reasonable increase based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have two 2s in my hand (64691722). This means the other 5 players (40 digits) need to have at least 3 more 2s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 2s across all 48 digits is 4.8. The expected number of 2s in the remaining 40 digits is 40/10 = 4. Therefore, needing 3 more 2s is statistically plausible, making a challenge risky. I should make a higher bid. I have two 6s. Bidding 5 6s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Since I hold two 6s, this bid requires 3 more 6s among the other 40 digits, which is similarly plausible to the current bid of 5 2s. This seems like a safe, incremental bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 14501507. I have two 5s, two 1s, two 0s, one 4, and one 7. The current bid is 5 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. A bid of 5 6s with 6 players and 48 total digits is slightly above average (average is 4.8 of any digit). Given my lack of 6s and the increasing bids, challenging seems risky as Player 3 might actually have a few 6s, and other players could too. Bidding higher is also risky without any 6s. The previous bids show an increase in both quantity and digit. I need to bid higher than 5 6s. Bidding 6 of any digit is a significant jump. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s. Bidding 6 5s is a possibility, as it's a higher quantity and a lower digit, making it a valid higher bid. This uses my strongest digit count. Given the history of bids, it seems like players might be bidding aggressively. Bidding 6 5s is a plausible next step based on my hand and the game state.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. With 6 players, the average number of 6s is 4.8, making 6 6s a slightly high bid. My hand contains one 6, but others may not have enough to meet the bid. Challenging risks eliminating me if the bid is valid, but the low probability of 6 6s makes this a reasonable risk.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. My hand contains two 4s. Bidding 3 4s is a valid higher bid (increasing the quantity) and is likely to be true as I only need one additional 4 from the remaining 32 digits among other players. Challenging 2 7s is risky given it's a low bid with 40 total digits.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. The expected average count for any digit is 4. I have one 4 in my hand (64691722). This means only two more 4s are needed among the remaining 32 digits for the bid to be true. This seems statistically likely, making a challenge risky. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 6s. Bidding 3 6s is a minimal increase (same quantity, higher digit) and is strongly supported by my hand, as only one more 6 is needed across the other 32 digits. This is a safe and credible bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 14501507. I have one 4, two 5s, zero 6s, one 7, and two 0s. The current bid is 3 6s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.  A bid of 3 6s is below average and seems plausible. I have zero 6s. Bidding 4 6s or higher is risky given my hand. Bidding on a different digit, like 4 5s, is a possibility since I have two 5s, but 4 5s is only slightly above average. Bidding 4 0s is also an option as I have two 0s. Given the current bid and my hand, challenging 3 6s is a reasonable move as I have no 6s, making it less likely for the total count to be 3 or more. However, the bid is not excessively high. A safer move might be to bid on a digit I have more of. Bidding 4 5s is a slightly higher bid than 3 6s and is supported by my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I hold no 6s, so challenging 4 6s would give me roughly a 60% chance to win but a 40% chance to be eliminated – too risky. I do, however, have two 7s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits still in play, the expected number of additional 7s is about 3.2, giving roughly an 83% chance that there are at least two more 7s out there. By raising to 4 7s I legally out-bid Player 0 (same quantity, higher digit) while basing the bid on a digit I’m strong in and keeping my elimination risk much lower than a direct challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand contains zero 7s, making the bid slightly higher than the expected value based on the remaining digits (expected 3.2 vs bid 4). However, challenging at a quantity of 4 is not extremely low probability and could be risky. My hand contains two 2s. Bidding 5 2s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and is well supported by my hand, as the expected total count of 2s is 2 (my hand) + 3.2 (from others) = 5.2. Bidding 5 2s is slightly below this expectation, making it a reasonable and safe bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have two 2s in my hand (64691722). This means the remaining 32 digits held by the other 4 players must contain at least three 2s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 2s among those 32 digits is 3.2 (32/10). Therefore, the bid of 5 2s is statistically plausible, and challenging it is risky. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 6s. Bidding 5 6s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This requires three additional 6s among the other 32 digits, which is also statistically plausible (expected 3.2). Given my hand and the relatively safe nature of the bid, 5 6s is a reasonable next step.

I have zero 6s. Bidding 5 6s seems high given the average and my hand. However, challenging might be risky as there could be several 6s among the other players. Looking at the bid history, 5 6s is not an outrageously high bid. I can bid 6 5s, as I have two 5s and have previously bid 4 5s in this round, indicating some strength in 5s.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 6s in my hand. Across the 40 total digits the expected count of any one digit is about 4. For the bid of 6 6s to be true, the other 32 unseen digits would need to supply all six 6s, a situation that occurs less than 10% of the time. In the previous 48-digit round there were only 5 sixes, underscoring how unlikely 6 sixes are now with fewer digits. The bid is therefore very dubious, so I will challenge.

With 4 players and 32 total digits, the average count of any digit is 3.2. A bid of 4 6s is slightly above average but not unreasonable, especially considering the previous rounds' bidding history has seen higher bids. However, I have no 6s to support a bid of 4 6s or higher. Bidding 5 of any digit seems too risky given my hand and the average distribution. Challenging 4 6s is a possibility, but it's not a guaranteed win. Based on my hand and the current bid, challenging is the safest move as I have no information to confidently raise the bid, and 4 6s without any in my hand is a risk I'm not willing to take.

Player 1 Reasoning: I hold two 7s. To win a challenge on a bid of 3 7s I would only need one more 7 among the 16 hidden digits (held by Players 2 and 4). The probability of at least one 7 appearing in 16 random digits is over 80%, giving me good security if the bid is later challenged. Challenging the current bid of 3 5s is risky: I already have one 5, and the chance that there are at least two more 5s in the 16 unknown digits is roughly 50%, so a challenge is close to a coin-flip and not worth the risk. Therefore, the best move is to raise by keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit to something supported by my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 34226493, containing two 4s. The current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 4 4s is a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity. With 24 total digits, the expected count of any digit is 2.4. My hand contributes two 4s, meaning only two more 4s are needed from the remaining 16 digits for the bid of 4 4s to be true. This is a plausible scenario (expected count in 16 digits is 1.6), making 4 4s a reasonable bid based on my hand strength without being an obvious bluff. Challenging 3 7s is also an option as I have no 7s and 3 7s is slightly above expectation, but making a plausible bid based on my hand seems like a safer strategic move at this point.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 14501507. The current bid is 4 4s. I have one 4 and two 5s in my hand.  The probability of having at least four 4s across 24 digits is moderate, but given the previous bids and the fact that Player 2 made this bid, it's plausible. I can make a higher bid. I have two 5s, and the previous bid was 4 4s. Bidding 4 5s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is supported by my hand. Bidding 5 5s is also possible but a bit riskier.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I can see only one 5 in my hand, so challenging is risky because Player 4’s confident series of 5-bids suggests they probably hold several 5s; the bid could well be correct. Instead, I’ll raise the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have two 7s, so I already hold half of the four required. With 16 unknown digits spread over the other two players, getting at least two more 7s is quite plausible, yet it will look ambitious enough that Player 2 (acting next) may decide to challenge. This move avoids the high risk of an immediate challenge loss for me while pressuring the opposition with a bid that is supported by my cards.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s by Player 1. There are 24 total digits remaining. My hand contains zero 7s. The expected number of 7s across 24 digits is 2.4. A bid of 4 7s is significantly above this average. Since I have no 7s, all 4+ 7s must be among the other 16 digits held by Player 1 and Player 4. The probability of having 4 or more 7s in 24 random digits is around 20-25%. This means there is a high probability (around 75-80%) that the actual count of 7s is less than 4. Given the low probability of the bid being true and my lack of 7s, challenging is the strategically sound move.

Player 2 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round, and the current bid is 'None'. I must make a valid initial bid. My hand is 34226493, which contains two 4s, two 2s, and two 3s. Bidding 2 of any of these digits is a safe starting bid as I already have the required quantity in my hand. I will choose to bid 2 4s.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 14501507. I have one 4. The current bid is 2 4s. With 16 total digits, the probability of having at least two 4s is not extremely low, but Player 2 made the bid, so they likely have at least one 4. I have two 5s, two 0s, two 1s, and one 7. I can make a higher bid based on my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a safe increase based on my two 5s, and is a higher quantity than the current bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 4. My hand contains zero 5s. For this bid to be true, Player 4 must hold at least three 5s in their 8 digits. With 16 total digits remaining (8 in my hand, 8 in Player 4's), the probability of Player 4 having three or more 5s is very low (approximately 3.8% assuming a uniform distribution in their hand). Challenging this bid is highly likely to result in a win.
