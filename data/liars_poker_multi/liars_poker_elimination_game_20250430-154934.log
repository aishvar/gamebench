Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It is the start of the round, and I am the first player to bid. There is no current bid. My hand contains two 0s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8. Bidding 3 0s is a reasonable and conservative opening bid based on having two 0s in my hand and the expectation that others likely have some as well. It is a valid bid as it is higher than 'None'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 95607263, and I have one 0. The current bid is 3 0s by Player 0. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an average of 4.8 zeros would be expected if digits are uniformly distributed. Since I have one 0, it's plausible that there are at least two more zeros among the other 40 digits. However, I can make a higher bid to push the game forward. I'll bid 4 5s since I have one 5 in my hand, and it's a reasonable increase in quantity and digit to test the other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand, which makes a bid of 4 5s unlikely. However, I also have one 6 in my hand. Challenging the current bid is risky, as it could be true, but bidding 5 6s is a reasonable and safe move, increasing the digit and keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 2. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than 5 6s. I have the digits 4, 9, 6, 5, 9, 5, 9, 1 in my hand, which includes two 6s and three 5s. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 6 6s seems risky since there are only 8 sixes possible in total (one per player), and we already have a bid of 5 6s. A safer bet would be to bid a higher digit with a reasonable quantity. I see I have three 9s, so bidding 3 9s would be a reasonable increase in digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 2. I have two 6s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains 6s, I can reasonably increase the quantity. Bidding 7 6s seems aggressive but possible given that I don't know the distribution of 6s in other players' hands. However, considering the total number of digits remaining (48) and that each player has 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit across all players is 48. A bid of 7 6s seems plausible and higher than the current bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is only 1 zero, which is almost certain given 40 digits but doesn’t leverage my strong hand. I hold three 8s, so bidding 2 8s is a safe raise (I know at least three exist) and still forces opponents to escalate or risk losing.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. My hand contains two 0s and one 8. A bid of 2 8s is relatively low given there are 40 total digits, making a challenge risky. Bidding higher is the preferred move. Based on my hand, bidding 3 0s is a strong option as I have two 0s and only need one more from the remaining 32 digits across 4 players. This is a statistically likely scenario and a valid bid higher than 2 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 95607263, which contains one 0, one 2, one 3, one 5, two 6s, one 7, and one 9. The current bid is 3 0s by Player 0. I have one 0 in my hand, so it's possible that there are at least three 0s across all 40 digits, given that each player has 8 digits. Challenging seems risky as the bid is low and plausible. Instead, I will make a higher bid. Since I have two 6s, bidding on 6s seems reasonable. The last bid on 6s in the previous round was 7, but with one player eliminated, I'll bid conservatively. I will bid 4 6s, increasing both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 3 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid in this round, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand is 95607263, which contains two 6s. With 4 active players and a total of 32 digits, I estimate that there could be more 6s among the other players. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable starting point, as it leverages my own count and assumes at least one more 6 might exist in the other 24 digits.

Player 5 Reasoning: I hold three 8s in my hand, so I know there are at least three 8s total. The current bid is 3 7s, and I can safely raise to 3 8s, which is the minimum strictly higher bid and guarantees a win if challenged. This also pressures the next player to bid 3 9s or increase the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. My hand contains 01486570, which includes two 0s and one 8. The expected number of any digit across 32 total digits is 3.2. Bidding 3 8s is close to the expected value, and I have one 8, so challenging seems risky as the other players likely have at least two more 8s. Bidding higher is a better option. Based on my hand strength, I have two 0s. Bidding 4 0s is a valid higher bid (increasing quantity from 3 to 4) and leverages the digits I hold. This seems like a reasonable and supportable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 95607263, which contains one 0. The current bid is 4 0s by Player 0. With 32 total digits across 4 players, it's possible but not highly likely that there are 4 or more 0s in total, given I only have one. However, since the bid is relatively low and it's early in the round, I’ll avoid challenging and instead make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 4 6s feels reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 4 0s. This keeps me in the game while testing the waters with a plausible bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 95607263, which gives me two 6s, and single occurrences of 9, 5, 0, 7, 2, and 3. With a total of 24 digits across all players, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as I already have two 6s, and it's likely that at least one more 6 exists among the other 16 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. My hand contains two 0s and one 8. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the digit (to 3 9s) or increase the quantity (to 4 of any digit or higher). Bidding 3 9s is a pure bluff as I have no 9s. Bidding 4 of a digit is a stronger option if I have multiple of that digit. I have two 0s, making a bid of 4 0s plausible. This requires two more 0s from the other 16 digits, which is a reasonable probability. Challenging 3 8s is risky; I have one 8, so the bid is true if the other two players have at least two 8s combined. Bidding 4 0s is a valid higher bid based on my hand strength in 0s and seems less risky than challenging or bluffing on 9s.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 95607263, which contains one 0. The current bid is 4 0s by Player 0. With a total of 24 digits across three players, it's possible but not highly likely that there are 4 zeros in play, as it would require the other two players to have at least 3 zeros combined. Looking at my hand, I have strong counts of 6s (three 6s) and could comfortably bid higher on that digit. Bidding 4 6s is a safer move for me since I already contribute three to the count, making it more likely to be true even if challenged. This also increases the quantity and digit from the current bid of 4 0s, satisfying the bidding rules.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand, so there are guaranteed to be at least three 8s among the 16 total digits. Opening with a bid of 3 8s is safe—if my opponent challenges, I will win, and they must raise quantity or digit to continue.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s, made by Player 5. There are 16 total digits across two players (8 in my hand, 8 in Player 5's hand). My hand is 01486570, which contains one 8. For the bid of 3 8s to be true, there must be at least three 8s in total. Since I have one 8, Player 5 must have at least two 8s in their hand of 8 digits. Based on probability estimates for 16 random digits, the chance of having at least three 8s in total, given I have one, is approximately 25.7%. This means there is approximately a 74.3% chance that the total number of 8s is less than three, making the bid false. Challenging the bid gives me a 74.3% probability of winning the round and eliminating Player 5. My best alternative bid would be based on the digits I have multiple of, like 0s (I have two). Bidding 4 0s would require Player 5 to have at least two 0s, and the probability of having at least four 0s in total (given I have two) is significantly lower than 25.7% (around 14%). Bidding 4 0s would likely result in Player 5 challenging me, and I would have a high probability of losing that challenge. Therefore, challenging the current bid of 3 8s is the most favorable action.
