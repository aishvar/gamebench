Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand (72638924), I have one 2, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 7, one 8, and one 9. I don't have any duplicates in my hand. Since this is the first bid, I should start conservatively but strategically. I know there are 48 total digits in the game (6 players ร 8 digits each). On average, each digit (0-9) would appear about 4.8 times. I have one 7 in my hand, so there are likely a few more 7s among other players. Starting with a bid of '5 7s' seems reasonable - it's slightly above the statistical average but not too aggressive for an opening bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 5 7s. Bidding 6 8s is a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity. With 40 digits remaining among the other 5 players, the average expected count for any digit is 4. Needing 4 more 8s to reach a total of 6 is exactly the average expectation from the remaining hands, making 6 8s a plausible and reasonable bid based on my hand and the game state.

Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits in total. Statistically, each digit appears about 4.8 times on average. The current bid is 6 8s, which is slightly above the expected average but not outrageous. Since I only have one 8, unless someone has a particularly heavy hand in 8s, 6 is a stretch but still possible. However, I don't have enough information to confidently challenge yet, so I will make a minimal legal raise to 6 9s to keep pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. My hand is 49338007, which contains two 9s. Knowing this, I can assess the likelihood of the current bid. Since there are 6 players and the bid is 6 9s, it seems plausible as it averages to 1 nine per player. However, I have two 9s, which is above average. To make a higher bid, I can either bid a higher quantity of 9s or the same quantity of a higher digit (which doesn't exist since 9 is the highest digit). I will increase the quantity to 7 9s, as it's a reasonable next step given my hand and the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the likelihood of there being at least 3 zeros among all players. Looking at my own hand (72638924), I have zero 0s. There are 5 active players with 8 digits each, for a total of 40 digits. If the digits were evenly distributed, we'd expect about 4 of each digit (40 รท 10 = 4). Since I have no 0s, the remaining players would need to have at least 3 zeros among them. This is certainly possible, but not guaranteed. Player 5 increased from Player 4's modest bid of 1 0s to 3 0s, which suggests they might have at least one 0 in their hand. I could challenge, but it's a risky move this early in the game. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Since I have two 2s in my hand, I'll bid 3 2s, which is higher than 3 0s because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. My hand contains zero 2s, making a challenge risky as 3 2s is close to the expected count among the other players' hands (expected 3.2 among 32 digits). I must bid higher. My hand has two 9s, which is tied for my strongest digit count. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid (quantity 4 > 3) and is plausible as I have two 9s and the expected total count of 9s among 40 digits is 4. This bid is based on my hand strength and puts pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. In my hand (04952645), I have one 9. With 40 digits in play and my own hand only showing one 9, it's possible but not certain there are three more 9s among the other 32 digits. Statistically, the expected number of 9s per player is about 0.8 (since each digit is equally likely). That would mean about 4 9s total, making the current bid plausible but not safe to challenge. To stay in the game, I should make a minimal higher bid. The lowest strictly higher bid is 4 9s -> 4 0s, but since 0 is a lower digit, that's not valid. The next valid bid is 4 9s -> 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, so it's possible, and it's a minimal increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: As the starting bidder in this round, I should make an opening bid. My hand contains two 4s, two 5s, two 6s, one 0, and one 9. Since there are 32 digits in play (4 players x 8 digits), the average count for any digit is about 3.2. Opening with a conservative bid of 3 of a digit I have multiple of is reasonable. I will bid 3 4s, as I have two myself, making it more likely to be a safe opening bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 15200908, which contains zero 4s. The current bid is 3 4s. With 32 total digits across 4 players, the expected number of any single digit is around 3.2 (32/10). Since I have no 4s, the other three players would need to have a total of at least three 4s among their 24 digits (8 per player * 3 players). While not impossible, bidding 3 4s when I have none seems a bit high. I could challenge, but the game history shows a previous challenge where the bidder won with 6 0s when the bid was 5 0s, indicating some players might have concentrated digits. I have three 0s in my hand. Bidding 4 0s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and is strongly supported by my hand. This seems like a safer and more strategic move than challenging.

Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (72638924), I don't have any 0s. Player 5 has bid 4 0s, which means they believe there are at least 4 zeros among all 32 digits. Since I don't have any zeros, all 4 would need to come from the other 3 players' hands (24 digits total). This is certainly possible but not guaranteed. I could challenge, but it's a risky move this early in the game. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have one 2 in my hand, so I could bid 4 2s (same quantity, higher digit). I also have one 3, one 4, one 6, one 7, one 8, and one 9 in my hand. Since I know these digits exist, bidding on one of them is safer. I'll bid 4 2s, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s, made by Player 0. My hand contains zero 2s. With 32 total digits remaining among 4 players, the average expected count for any digit is 3.2. A bid of 4 is above this average, especially considering I hold none of the digit. The expected number of 2s among the other 3 players (24 digits) is 2.4. Challenging this bid is a reasonable move as 4 is significantly higher than the expectation based on random distribution among the other players. While Player 0 might have several 2s, challenging tests their claim and offers a chance to eliminate an opponent if the bid is inflated.

Player 0 Reasoning: I'm starting this round with my hand containing 72638924. I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 2, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 7, one 8, and one 9. I don't have any 0s, 1s, or 5s. Since I'm making the first bid, I should bid conservatively but strategically. I could bid on a digit I have, which gives me certainty of at least one. The remaining 16 digits (from the other two players) are unknown. If I assume random distribution, each digit would appear about 1.6 times on average among those 16 digits. A reasonable starting bid might be on 2s since I have one. I'll bid 3 2s, estimating there might be 2 more 2s among the other players. This is a conservative opening bid that leaves room for the bidding to develop.

To make a legal bid, I can either raise the digit at the same quantity (e.g., 3 3s, 3 4s, etc.) or increase the quantity. My hand has two 4s and two 5s, so bidding 3 4s leverages my own hand strength. This is a safe incremental raise and keeps me in the game without overcommitting.

Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. Looking at my hand (72638924), I don't have any 0s. Player 5 has bid 4 0s, meaning they're claiming there are at least 4 zeros among all 24 digits. Since I have no zeros, all 4 would need to be in the other players' hands. This is certainly possible, but not guaranteed. To make a higher bid, I could either bid 5 or more of any digit, or 4 of a digit higher than 0. Looking at my hand, I have one 2, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 7, one 8, and one 9. I don't have a strong concentration of any digit, so bidding 5 of anything would be risky. Instead, I'll bid 4 2s, which is higher than 4 0s because the digit is higher while maintaining the same quantity. This is somewhat risky since I only have one 2, but it's a reasonable next step in the bidding sequence.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 04952645, which contains two 4s and one 2. The current bid is 4 2s. With only one 2 in my hand, for the bid to be valid, there must be at least three more 2s among the other 16 digits. The probability of this is not negligible, but not high enough to confidently challenge. However, I have two 4s, so I can safely increase the digit to 4 and keep the quantity at 4, making the next valid bid '4 4s'. This is a reasonable and safe increment based on my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have two 0s, one 1, one 2, one 5, one 8, and two 0s in my hand.  I previously bid 4 0s, and Player 0 bid 4 2s, and Player 2 bid 4 4s.  Based on my hand, I have two 0s.  The probability of having four 4s across three players with 24 total digits is not extremely high, but it's not impossible.  Given the bidding history, Player 2 seems to be bidding up the 4s.  I have two 0s, so bidding on 0s is a possibility, but I'd need to bid 5 0s.  Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have multiples of, like 0s, but I'd need to increase the quantity from 4.  Bidding 5 0s is a valid higher bid.  Challenging 4 4s is risky as Player 2 might actually have a few 4s.  Bidding 5 0s seems like a reasonable next step, leveraging the digits I have.

Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. In my hand (72638924), I have zero 0s. The current bid is 5 0s made by Player 5. With 3 players remaining and 8 digits each, there are 24 total digits in play. Player 5 has bid 5 0s, which means they're claiming there are at least 5 zeros among all players. Since I have none, these 5 zeros would need to be distributed between Player 2 and Player 5. This is certainly possible, but I should consider the bidding history. Player 5 previously bid 4 0s, which suggests they might have several 0s in their hand. Looking at my options, I could bid 5 1s, 5 2s, 5 3s and so on, or increase the quantity to 6. Since I have one 2 in my hand, bidding 5 2s seems reasonable. I also have one 3, so 5 3s would be an option too. Given that I've previously bid on 2s, I'll go with 5 2s to maintain consistency.

The previous highest bid on 4s this round was 4 4s, so I can safely bid 5 4s, which is a higher bid both in quantity and digit, and is supported by my hand.

A safe opening bid is to bid based on the most frequent digit in my hand, which is 0 or 9 (two of each). Bidding 3 0s is a reasonable starting bid, slightly higher than the expected average (16 total digits / 10 possible digits = 1.6 per digit).

Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (72638924), I have zero 0s. The current bid is 3 0s by Player 5. Since there are only 16 total digits remaining (8 in my hand, 8 in Player 5's hand), and I have no 0s, that means Player 5 would need to have at least 3 zeros in their hand for this bid to be valid. While this is possible, it's somewhat unlikely that Player 5 would have 3 or more zeros in just 8 digits (probability around 21.5%). Additionally, Player 5 has consistently bid on 0s in previous rounds, which might indicate they have several 0s. However, they may also be bluffing. Given that I have 2s in my hand, I could bid 3 2s, but I already see that I have only one 2 in my hand, so there would need to be at least two more 2s in Player 5's hand. Instead, I'll bid 3 3s, as I have one 3 in my hand, so I only need Player 5 to have two 3s for this to be valid, which is more likely than them having three 0s.

Given the history and my hand, challenging this bid of 3 3s is a strong option as I know I have zero 3s, making it less likely there are three 3s between the two of us.
