Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: There are 48 digits remaining, so a bid of 1 9s is valid. I have one 9 in my hand, making this a reasonable opening bid. I could also bid 2 6s, but 1 9s is a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s made by Player 1. I have one 9 in my hand. Given that there are 6 players and each player has 8 digits, there are a total of 48 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. Since I only have one 9, bidding 3 9s seems risky without more information. However, I can try to make a safe bid by increasing the digit. I notice that bidding 2 0s is a valid move as it matches the quantity but increases the digit. This seems like a reasonable strategy to increase my chances without taking too much risk.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s made by Player 1. I have one 9 in my hand. Given that there are 6 players and each player has 8 digits, there are a total of 48 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. Bidding 3 9s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity from the current bid and I have at least one 9 to contribute.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I hold two 1s in my eight-digit hand. With 48 digits total in play, any given digit is expected to appear around five times, so it is very likely that there are at least two more 1s among the remaining 40 unseen digits. The current bid is 3 9s; challenging that would be risky because three 9s is also quite plausible. Instead, I will raise the quantity to 4 and switch to a digit I have multiple copies of, making the bid both legal and believable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Challenging 4 1s would require the total count of 1s to be less than 4, which is plausible but risky given I only have one 1 and the average expectation is around 4.8 per digit across all players. I have two 4s and two 7s in my hand. Bidding 4 4s or 4 7s are both valid higher bids (same quantity, higher digit) that are supported by my hand. Bidding 4 7s is a stronger bid than 4 4s. Needing 2 more 7s from the other 5 players (40 digits) is a reasonable expectation. Making a bid based on my hand is less risky than challenging at this stage.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round, so the current bid is None. My hand contains two 7s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. The expected count of any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. The expected total count of 7s is 2 (mine) + 3.2 (expected in other hands) = 5.2. Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable starting bid, slightly below the expected value, based on having two 7s in my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s and one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. Since I have one 7, it's likely that there are at least 4 7s among all players. Bidding 5 6s seems reasonable because I have two 6s, and it's a higher bid than 4 7s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 0. I have two 6s in my hand, so I can bid 3 6s, increasing the quantity, but I can do better. I also have a 5, so I can bid 3 5s, but it's lower than the current bid. I can also bid 2 7s, but that's a new digit. Since I have two 8s, I can bid 2 8s, increasing the quantity and digit, which is a higher bid. I'll choose 2 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s made by Player 1. I have the hand 91467520, which contains one 6. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total number of digits is 40. The bid of 6 6s seems high but not impossible. However, I don't have enough information about other players' hands to be certain. I will bid higher than 6 6s. A reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 6 and the digit 9, which is higher than 6, I can make a bid of 7 6s or 4 9s. I choose to bid 7 6s as it directly competes with the current bid's quantity.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:5 - o3-2025-04-16) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I hold zero 6s, so all seven 6s would have to come from the 32 digits in the other four hands. With ten possible digits, those players should average only about three 6s altogether; reaching seven would require more than double that expectation. Even allowing for the bidders to be slightly heavy in 6s, the bid still looks much shakier than solid. I therefore have a better chance of surviving by challenging rather than by making an even riskier higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I start the round, so any legal bid is available. I have two 7s in my own eight digits. Out of the 24 unknown digits, the expected number of additional 7s is about 2.4, giving roughly a 70% chance that the total count of 7s is at least four. That makes 4 7s a bid I’m comfortable defending if it gets challenged, yet it is high enough to apply some early pressure on the other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s by Player 3. My hand is 74174256, which contains two 7s. There are 4 players total, with 32 digits remaining. An average distribution would be 3.2 of each digit. The current bid of 4 7s is only slightly above average. I have two 7s, so the bid requires at least two more 7s among the other 24 digits. The expected number of 7s in 24 digits is 2.4. So, the bid of 4 7s (my 2 + >=2 from others) is quite plausible. Challenging would mean I win if there are 3 or fewer 7s total; with my two 7s, this requires 1 or fewer 7s among the other 24 digits. The probability of this is low (~28.7%). Therefore, challenging is too risky. I need to make a higher bid. My hand has two 7s and two 4s, making 5 7s or 5 4s reasonable bids. Bidding 5 7s directly escalates on the current digit and leverages my hand strength in 7s. Bidding 5 7s requires at least three more 7s among the other 24 digits, which has a probability of about 43.6% based on random distribution. This is a plausible bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s and one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 5 7s. Bidding 6 6s is a reasonable move since it increases the digit while maintaining a plausible quantity. I have seen 6s bid multiple times previously, suggesting they are likely present in other players' hands. Challenging seems risky given the previous successful bid of 4 7s.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid of 6 6s by Player 0 seems reasonable based on the total digits remaining and the bids made so far. However, I can safely bid 7 6s, increasing the digit to a higher value, making it a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I hold 0 sixes. To satisfy the bid of 7 6s, all seven (or more) must come from the 24 digits held by the other three players, meaning nearly 30% of their digits would have to be 6s. Under a random distribution the expected number of sixes in those 24 digits is only about 2-3, and the chance of there being 7 or more is well under 1%. In the previous round a bid of 7 6s was also false even with 40 digits in play. The current bid is therefore very likely an overbid, so challenging maximizes my chance of winning the round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I hold two 7s. Across the 16 unknown digits the expected number of additional 7s is about 1.6, making a total of roughly 3-4 sevens plausible. Opening with 4 7s is just above expectation but not outrageous, and only the digits 8 or 9 allow an equal-quantity overbid, limiting easy counters. Bidding on a digit I already have multiples of gives me leeway if the count rises further and lets me challenge confidently if someone pushes the quantity too high, as happened in earlier rounds.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s, made by Player 3. My hand contains two 7s. There are 16 digits remaining among the other two players (Player 0 and Player 3). For the bid of 4 7s to be true, there must be at least 4 - 2 = 2 more 7s among these 16 digits. Based on probability (assuming random hands for others), the chance of getting at least two 7s in 16 digits is approximately 48.6%. Conversely, the chance of getting zero or one 7 in 16 digits (making the bid false) is approximately 51.4%. Challenging the bid offers a slightly better than 50% chance of winning. Making a higher bid, such as 5 7s (requiring at least three more 7s from 16 digits, ~21.2% chance of being true) or 4 8s/9s (requiring four from 16 digits, ~7% chance of being true), is significantly riskier. Given the favorable odds for challenging and the risk of making a likely false bid, challenging is the optimal move.

Player 3 Reasoning: I hold two 7s (7♠ and 7♣) in my eight-digit hand, so I know there are at least two 7s among the 16 total digits. Opening with a bid that is certainly true means I can never be caught out by an immediate challenge, while still keeping the quantity low enough to leave room for future raises. Therefore the safest and most strategic opening is 2 7s.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s, which is a low bid. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable increase, as it raises both the quantity and the digit. Given the bidding history, it's likely that there are at least three 6s in total across both players' hands. Additionally, challenging 2 7s seems risky, as it's plausible that there are at least two 7s between both players.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have no 6s, so challenging the bid of 3 6s carries a real risk: earlier rounds showed an unusually high frequency of 6s and Player 0 would probably not invite another challenge from me unless they felt confident. Instead, I hold two 7s (about 13 % of all digits in play). By raising to 3 7s I only need Player 0 to have at least one 7, which is quite likely – in the previous 3-player round, Players 0 and 4 already held three 7s between them. Thus my new bid is very plausible for me while still legally out-ranking the current bid and forcing the pressure back onto Player 0.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have 3 6s in my hand. Player 3 bid 3 7s. Since I cannot match the digit 7, I need to increase the quantity. Given the total digits remaining (16) and the bidding history, it's reasonable to bid 4 6s, as it's a modest increase and leverages my hand's strength.

Player 3 Reasoning: I hold zero 6s. For the bid of 4 6s to be valid, Player 0 would have to possess all four (or more) 6s in their 8-digit hand. Under a random distribution, the chance of a player having at least four 6s in eight digits is about 0.5%. Even giving some credit for their repeated focus on 6s, their past bids have consistently been overestimates (they were off by one 6 in the two previous rounds). The probability that there are 4 or more 6s in total is therefore extremely small. Challenging is far safer than trying to out-bid with a weak position.
