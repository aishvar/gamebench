Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can make a conservative opening bid. I have two 9s in my hand, so I will bid 3 9s to start.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s, which means there are at least three 9s in all players' hands. I have two 9s in my hand (digits '6 9 9 7 0 0 1 1'), so I know I have at most 2 nines. To beat a bid of 3 9s, I would need to bid at least 4 of some digit or 3 of a higher digit. Since I have only 2 nines, bidding 4 9s is impossible. The highest I can reasonably bid is 3 0s or 3 1s, but those are lower than 3 9s. Therefore, I should challenge the bid because it's unlikely that there are 3 nines in total, given my hand and the maximum total digits. Challenging seems the best move to test the validity of the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand. Bidding 4 0s means I only need one more 0 among the 32 unknown digits, which is about a 97% chance. This safely beats the current 3 3s by increasing the quantity and leverages my strong holding in zeros.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 68555186, which contains no 0s. The current bid is 4 0s by Player 2, and with 40 total digits across 5 players, it's possible but not highly likely that there are at least 4 0s in play. However, since I have no 0s, I estimate the probability is lower. Still, challenging might be risky early in the round without stronger evidence. Instead, I can make a higher bid. I have three 5s in my hand, so bidding 4 5s feels reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 4 0s, and I have a good portion of the count myself.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits: 79035442. I see that I have two 5s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my goal is to make a higher bid, I will count my available digits and see if I can make a reasonable bid. I have 2 fives, and there are 40 total digits. Assuming the other players have a similar distribution, bidding a higher digit seems risky without more information. I will increase the quantity slightly and bid on a digit that I have in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a low bid. I have two 3s and two 9s in my hand. I will bid 3 3s, which is a reasonable starting bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I hold three zeros in my hand, so only one zero is needed among the 24 unseen cards. With an expected 2.4 zeros among them, bidding 4 zeros is very likely. This raises the quantity above the current bid of 3 3s.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:1 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 68555186, which contains three 5s. The current bid is 4 0s by Player 2. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since I have a strong count of 5s in my hand, bidding 4 5s seems reasonable as it increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, and I know at least three of those 5s exist. This bid is higher than 4 0s as the digit 5 is greater than 0. I don't think challenging 4 0s is wise since it's a relatively low bid and could easily be true with 32 total digits in play. Therefore, I will bid 4 5s to stay in the game and leverage my hand's strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits: 7, 9, 0, 3, 5, 4, 4, 2. I see that I have one 5 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 5, bidding a higher quantity than 4 is risky without knowing the other players' hands. However, I can bid a higher digit with a reasonable quantity. Bidding 4 9s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit and I have a 9 in my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, which is a valid higher bid. However, I am not confident that there are at least five 0s out there. I could bid 5 9s, but I only have two 9s. Bidding 5 0s seems like a safer move than challenging. I will bid 5 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. To bid 5 1s I need three more among the 24 unknown digits, which has a probability of about 44%. Bidding 6 0s also needs three more zeros and has the same probability, but increasing the digit rather than the quantity is the less aggressive move. Therefore I will bid 5 1s.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:1 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 68555186, which contains two 5s, two 6s, two 8s, one 1, and one 0. The current bid is 5 1s by Player 2. In my hand, I only have one 1, which means I contribute just one to the total count of 1s. With 32 total digits across 4 players, the maximum possible count for 1s is 32, but it's unlikely that the other players have enough 1s to make up the remaining 4 needed to reach 5. Based on probability, each digit should average around 3.2 occurrences across all hands (32 digits / 10 possible digits). A bid of 5 1s is above this average, and since I only have one, it feels risky. However, challenging might be premature as 5 is not an extremely high bid. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid of 5 5s, since I have two 5s myself, which makes it somewhat plausible, and it increases the digit while maintaining the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s made by Player 3. I have the hand 79035442, which contains one 5. Given that there are 4 active players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 32 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. Since the bid is 5 5s, I need to assess if it's likely or not. With one 5 in my hand and assuming the other players might have a few 5s as well, a total of 5 5s seems plausible but not certain. However, bidding higher requires a strategic choice. I can see that bidding 6 0s seems reasonable as there are plenty of 0s and other digits that could make up a higher quantity, but I must ensure my bid is valid and strategic.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. Bidding higher on 0s seems risky. I have two 3s, and I previously bid 3 3s. I can bid 7 0s, or I can bid 6 of a higher number. Based on my hand, I think bidding 7 0s is safer than trying to bluff a higher quantity of 3s, 5s, 8s, or 9s. I will bid 7 0s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand and the bid is 7 0s. The remaining 24 cards would need at least four 0s but expect only 2.4 (Binomial(24,0.1)), so the bid is unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 68555186, which contains three 5s and two 6s, but no 0s. The current bid by Player 2 is 4 0s across all 24 digits in play among the three active players. Since I have no 0s in my hand, the likelihood of there being at least 4 0s depends entirely on the other two players' hands. With each player having 8 digits, it's possible but not highly likely that the other two players have enough 0s to make up the count. However, bidding higher is a safer option for now. I can bid 4 5s, increasing the digit while maintaining the quantity, and leveraging the three 5s I already have in my hand. This seems like a reasonable bid given my hand strength in 5s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is '4 5s' made by Player 3. My hand contains 2 fives. Given that there are only 3 active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total number of digits is 24. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. I should assess the likelihood of there being at least 4 fives in total. Since I have 2 fives, and assuming the other players could have some fives as well, it's possible but not certain. I also need to consider if I can make a higher bid. A bid must be higher in quantity or in digit. Bidding '5 5s' would be a higher quantity with the same digit, which seems reasonable given my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand (70314100), so the bid of 5 fives would require all five to be in the other 16 cards. The probability of at least five 5s among 16 unknown digits is under 2%, making this bid extremely unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 68555186, which contains three 5s and two 6s, but no 0s. The current bid by Player 2 is 4 0s. Since there are only 16 total digits in play (8 per player), and I have no 0s in my hand, the likelihood of there being at least 4 0s depends entirely on Player 2's hand. The maximum number of 0s Player 2 could have is 8, but it's statistically unlikely for them to have 4 or more 0s given a random distribution (probability of 4 or more 0s in 8 digits is relatively low). However, since this is early in the round and I have a strong hand with three 5s, I can safely bid higher. I will bid 4 5s, as I already contribute three to the count, making it more plausible even if Player 2 has none or few 5s.
