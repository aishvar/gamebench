Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one 1, one 4, two 3s, one 6, one 5, and one 2. The current bid is 1 0s. Since I have no 0s, and the bid is very low, I should make a bid that reflects a digit I have multiple of or a digit that is likely to appear in other hands. I have two 3s. Bidding 2 3s is a safe and higher bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. Bidding 3 1s increases the quantity to a plausible level given my holdings, and exceeds the current bid of 2 3s by quantity, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 55725677, so I have three 7s. The bid of 3 1s is plausible (I have zero 1s and others likely have enough), so challenging isn’t wise. I can safely raise to 3 7s (same quantity, higher digit), and my three sevens guarantee the bid will be met.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have zero 7s in my hand. Bidding higher than 3 7s is possible. I could bid 4 7s, but that seems risky given I have no 7s. I have two 8s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Bidding 4 0s is also a valid bid, but I only have one 0. Therefore, bidding 3 8s is the most logical option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '3 8s'. Looking at my hand (39848273), I have one 8. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For the bid of '3 8s' to be valid, there need to be at least 3 eights total. I already have 1, so there would need to be at least 2 more among the other players, which is certainly possible. I could make a higher bid like '3 9s', but I don't have any 9s in my hand. I could bid '4 0s', '4 1s', etc., but without knowing what other players have, this increases my risk. Since '3 8s' is a reasonable bid given the total number of digits, and I have one 8 myself, I'll make a safe higher bid of '4 0s'. I have no 0s in my hand, but with 48 total digits, it's reasonable to expect at least 4 zeros among all players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I'm starting this round with my hand containing 39848273. Looking at my hand, I have one 2, one 3, one 4, one 7, two 8s, and one 9. Since I'm the first to bid in this round, I need to make a strategic opening bid. I want to bid something that has a good chance of being true based on my hand, but not so obvious that it's easy for others to build upon. With two 8s in my hand, I could start with a conservative bid of '2 8s', which I know is true just from my hand. However, a slightly more aggressive bid might be better to set the pace. Since I have two 8s, bidding '3 8s' would mean there only needs to be one more 8 among the other 32 digits held by other players, which is quite likely. This is a reasonable opening bid that balances safety with strategic positioning.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 11433652. I have zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 5. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. A bid of 3 8s is plausible, but I have no 8s to support it.  However, challenging is risky as it's a relatively low bid.  Looking at my hand, I have two 1s and two 3s. I can make a higher bid based on these digits. Bidding 4 1s or 4 3s are both valid and increase the quantity, which is a stronger move than just increasing the digit with the same quantity. Bidding 4 1s is slightly less likely than 4 3s based on my hand, but both are reasonable. Bidding 4 1s is a valid higher bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The expected count for any digit across 40 digits is 4. Since I have one 2, bidding 4 2s is statistically reasonable and follows the expected distribution. This bid is a valid higher bid than 4 1s (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages my hand's composition.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I hold three 5s in my hand, so bidding 4 5s is a valid raise and I only need one more 5 among the 32 unknown cards. The chance of at least one 5 in those cards is about 1–0.9ⁿ ≈ 96.6%, making this a very safe bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 5s is risky without knowing other players' hands. I can either bid 5 5s, which is unlikely to be true, or bid on a digit I possess. I have two 8s, and the previous bid on 8s was 3 8s by Player 5. I can bid 4 8s, which is a reasonable increase. Alternatively, I could challenge, but the previous rounds showed players are willing to bid somewhat aggressively. I'll go with the safer bid of 4 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand (39848273). Player 4 has bid 4 8s. Since I know I have 2 of them, there would need to be at least 2 more 8s among the other players' hands for this bid to be valid. With 5 players each having 8 digits, the total number of 8s could reasonably be 4 or more. I could bid 4 9s to increase the digit while keeping the same quantity, or 5 with any digit to increase the quantity. Since I have a 9 in my hand, I'll bid 4 9s.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:5 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand (11433652). With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count per digit is 4. A bid of 4 9s is exactly the average, but I have none. Player 5 just bid 4 9s, which means they likely have at least one 9, but bidding 4 seems risky if they don't have many. Given my lack of 9s and the fact that the bid is already at the average count, challenging seems like a reasonable move. While it's possible there are four or more 9s among the other players, my hand doesn't support increasing the bid, and challenging is less risky than making a higher bid I can't support.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I'm starting a new round with 4 players, each having 8 digits, for a total of 32 digits. Looking at my hand (39848273), I have: one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 7, one 8, one 9, and one 8 (so two 8s total). Since I'm the first to bid in this round, I should make a strategic opening bid. I want to bid something I have multiple of, so bidding on 8s makes sense since I have two of them. A conservative starting bid would be 3 8s - this claims there's at least one more 8 among the other players, which is reasonable. This bid is also consistent with my bidding history, as I've bid on 8s before.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand. The total remaining digits are 32. With my 8 digits containing no 8s, the expected total number of 8s across all players is 2.4. This makes the bid of 3 8s unlikely to be correct. Challenging has a higher probability of success.

Player 5 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding in this round with 3 active players (including myself). Looking at my hand (39848273), I have: one 2, one 3, two 4s, one 7, one 8, two 9s. Since I have two 8s in my hand, and I've successfully bid on 8s in previous rounds (suggesting other players might have some 8s too), I'll start with a conservative bid of 3 8s. This is reasonable because I already know about my two 8s, so I only need one more 8 between the other two players to make this bid valid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand and no 8s. Challenging 3 8s has only about a 56% chance of success, while bidding 4 5s needs just one more 5 among the 16 unknown cards (about an 82% chance). It also validly raises the quantity from 3 to 4. Therefore I'll bid 4 5s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Given that there are only 24 total digits remaining among the three players (including me), and Player 5 just bid 3 8s, it seems unlikely that there are 4 5s in total. While I don't know the other players' hands, challenging seems like the best course of action. The previous rounds show a willingness to challenge high bids, and this one feels similarly suspect.

Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the situation carefully. Looking at my hand (39848273), I have one 3. The current bid is '1 3s' by Player 4. Since there are only 16 total digits (8 from me, 8 from Player 4), and I already have one 3, there must be at least one 3 total. I could challenge, but since I have a 3 myself, it's very likely Player 4's bid is valid. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, so bidding on 8s would be strategic. I could bid '2 8s' which would be higher than '1 3s' and has good chances of being true given my hand. I also have two 7s, but I'll go with 8s since I've successfully bid on them in previous rounds.

Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the situation carefully. Looking at my hand (39848273), I have two 8s. The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 4. Since there are only 16 total digits in play (8 for each player), and I have 2 of the 8s, that means Player 4 would need to have at least 1 more 8 for the bid to be valid. Given that I've previously won with 8s bids in earlier rounds, Player 4 might suspect I have some 8s and is trying to call my bluff or has some 8s themselves. I have two options: 1) Make a higher bid like 3 9s (I have one 9 in my hand) or 4 0s (I have no 0s), or 2) Challenge the current bid. Since I have 2 out of the 8s needed for the bid to be valid, and Player 4 only needs 1 more 8 for their bid to be valid, challenging seems risky. I'll make a higher bid of 3 9s based on the 9 I have in my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 4 9s is a possibility, but risky. I could also bid on a different digit. I have two 8s, and the previous bid was 2 8s then 3 8s, so 8s seem 'hot'. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable option, increasing the quantity. I also have a 7, 0, 3, 4, and another 9. Given the recent history, increasing the 8s seems strategically sound. However, 3 9s is a relatively high bid with only 16 total digits, so challenging is also an option. Given my hand, and the recent challenges succeeding, I'll challenge. It's likely Player 5 is bluffing.
