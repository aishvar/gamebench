Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. The average expected count per digit across all players is approximately 4.8. Bidding 4 4s is a reasonable starting bid that aligns with statistical expectations and leverages my strong holding in 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 4s' and my hand containing one 4, I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Since my hand has a 4, it slightly increases the likelihood of the current bid being true. However, without more information about other players' hands, it's difficult to assess the bid's validity accurately. Considering the rules for making a higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Given that I have a 6 and a 7 in my hand, and no other information about the distribution of higher digits, bidding on a higher digit seems like a reasonable strategy. Bidding on a quantity of 4 with a higher digit than 4, such as 5, could be a safe move, but since I don't have any 5s, I'll consider the next higher digit I have, which is 6. Thus, bidding '4 6s' seems reasonable, as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same as the current bid, leveraging the information from my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 1. I can make a valid bid by increasing the quantity or digit. Considering the current bid is already at the maximum quantity of 4, I should increase the digit to a higher number that I have in my hand, which is 8.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand of 11500636, I have zero 8s. The current bid claims there are at least 4 8s total. With 6 players having 8 digits each, this is possible but seems unlikely given I have none. However, since this is early in the game and other players have shown confidence by making increasing bids, I could either bid '4 9s' to continue or challenge. Given I have no 8s to support the current bid and it's relatively high for this early stage, challenging is the safer option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and have good information about my hand: two 6s, one 5, one 3, one 1, and one 0. Since I have two 6s, and I know Player 1 was confident enough to bid 4 6s in the previous round (which wasn't challenged), there's a good chance there are still several 6s in play. Making a conservative opening bid of 3 6s would be strategic - it's based on what I can see in my hand, and leaves room for others to bid up if they want to challenge my knowledge of 6s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s, and I have the digits 2, 0, 8, 6, 0, 5, 3, 6. Counting my own 6s: I have two 6s. Since the total count of 6s across all players' hands is at least 3, I could consider raising the bid. I have 2 sixes, so to be safe, I should bid at least 4 sixes, which is a higher quantity than 3. Alternatively, challenging might be risky because I have two 6s, and the total could plausibly be 3 or more. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, given my hand and the previous bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have zero 6s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits left, the chance of at least four 6s among them is only about 40%, so the current bid of 4 6s is more likely false than true. Itâ€™s profitable to call the bluff now.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current round has no bids yet, so I can start with a bid. My hand contains the digits 2, 0, 8, 6, 0, 5, 3, 6. Counting my digits, I have: 0 appears twice, 2 once, 3 once, 5 once, 6 twice, 8 once. The total count for 0s is at least 2, for 2 is 1, for 3 is 1, for 5 is 1, for 6 is 2, and for 8 is 1. To be safe, I can bid 3 6s, which is within the total possible counts, and is a reasonable opening bid. Starting with 3 6s seems safe and strategic.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. Bidding 4 4s builds on this confidence, requiring only one additional 4 across the other three players' hands. Since 4 4s is a higher bid than 3 6s (due to increased quantity), it adheres to the rules and leverages my visible information.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 4s, I must decide whether to bid higher or challenge. With my hand being 01841037, I have one 4, which somewhat supports the current bid but doesn't provide strong evidence for a higher bid on 4s. Considering the total digits remaining (32) and the fact that I have one 4, bidding on a higher digit seems more reasonable. Since I have one 6 and one 7, and given that 6s have been bid on previously, I might consider bidding on 6s or a higher digit if I had more information. However, the safest increase from the current bid of 4 4s, without having a clear advantage in any specific digit, would be to either increase the quantity of 4s, which seems risky given the total count of digits, or increase the digit while possibly maintaining or slightly increasing the quantity. Given that I only have one 5 and no 6s or higher digits besides one 7, and considering the need for a strictly higher bid, I should look for a balance. Since I don't have enough information to comfortably increase the quantity of a specific digit higher than 4 without risking an unlikely bid, and given the history of challenges, a cautious approach might be to slightly increase the bid in a way that's still plausible. However, without a strong basis for a significantly higher bid, especially considering the elimination of players based on challenges, I must weigh the risk of overbidding against the potential gain. The presence of my single 7 suggests I could attempt a bid on 7s, but given the low quantity of 7s I hold and the lack of information on other players' hands, this could be risky. Thus, considering all factors, including the risk of elimination and the potential for other players to challenge, I must make a decision that balances risk and potential reward.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand (11500636). With 32 total digits and 4 players, the bid of 5 4s means there need to be at least 4 more 4s among other players' hands. While possible, this seems unlikely given the previous rounds showed relatively low counts. Additionally, Player 1 increased the quantity from 4 to 5, which is risky. Based on my hand knowledge and the bidding pattern, I think challenging is the best move.

Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand (11500636), I have: two 0s, three 1s, one 3, one 5, and one 6. Since I'm starting the round and have three 1s, bidding three 1s is a safe opening move. It's conservative enough to be likely true even if other players have few or no 1s, while still establishing a reasonable baseline for future bidding.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have the digits 2, 0, 8, 6, 0, 5, 3, 6 in my hand. Counting the 1s, I have zero. Since the total number of 1s across all hands must be at least 3, and I know I have none, challenging seems the best move to test the bid's validity. Bidding higher on 1s isn't logical because I can't increase the count or digit meaningfully, so challenging is the optimal choice.

Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand (11500636), I have two 1s, one 5, one 0, two 6s, one 3. Since this is the first bid of the round and there are only 2 players left (16 total digits), I should start conservatively. I have two 6s in my hand, which makes bidding on 6s a safe choice. Starting with '3 6s' would be reasonable since I already know about two of them, and there's a good chance of finding at least one more 6 among the opponent's eight digits.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 6s in my hand. Since only two players remain, all 6s must be in Player 3's 8-digit hand. The probability of Player 3 holding at least 3 6s in an 8-digit hand under random distribution is low (~4%). Historical data suggests Player 3 bids aggressively but not always truthfully.
