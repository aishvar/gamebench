Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s and other digits. Given that I have a pair of 6s, it seems reasonable to start with a bid that reflects my hand but also considers the total possible digits. With 48 total digits and 6 players, bidding on a digit I have in my hand could be a good strategy. I'll choose a quantity and digit that seems plausible and not too high, given it's the first bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have the digits 1,3,4,6,4,1,0,5. Counting the 6s, I see only one. The current bid is 3 6s, which is very close to the maximum possible total of 48. Given I only have one 6, it's unlikely that the total count across all players is 3 or more. Therefore, challenging the bid seems the best move to test the opponent's claim.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 08108366, I notice I have two 6s, two 8s, one 0, one 1, one 3, and one 6. Since I have multiple 6s and 8s, these could be good digits to bid on. However, considering the total number of digits remaining is 40 and we have 5 players, each with 8 digits, I should start with a relatively conservative bid to avoid being challenged. Bidding on the 6s seems like a good starting point because I have two of them, and it's a fairly high digit, which might discourage others from challenging immediately.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains three 5s. Given the expected average of 4 total 5s across all players, bidding 4 5s is reasonable. This bid is higher than the current bid of 3 6s and leverages the high number of 5s in my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have 4, 5, and 2 in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s. I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 6, as I have a 6 in my hand. This is a reasonable move based on my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 3. My hand is 12073963, which contains two 6s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s, it's possible others have more, making a higher quantity plausible. I will increase the quantity to make a new bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have a 7 in my hand, and bidding 5 7s is a valid higher bid since the digit is higher. This maintains the same quantity but increases the digit, making it a strategic move to challenge the current bid's validity while leveraging my own digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 7s and considering the total number of digits remaining is 40, it seems unlikely that there would be 5 or more 7s. My hand contains no 7s, which further decreases the likelihood. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40 and we are already at a high quantity of 5 for the digit 7, challenging this bid seems like the most reasonable action, as the probability of having at least 5 7s across all players' hands is low.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s and two 8s, but also a 0, a 1, a 3. Since I have to make a bid that is strictly higher than 'None', I should consider what could be a reasonable starting point. With 32 total digits remaining and 4 players, the maximum number of any digit could theoretically be 8 (if one player had all 8 of the same digit, which is unlikely). Considering the history, 6s have been a point of interest before, and I have two of them. However, starting with a high bid might not be wise without more information. A safer bet might be to start with a lower quantity of a higher digit that I have in my hand, or match the quantity of a digit I have multiple of, considering the game's history. Since I have two 8s and they are high digits, bidding on them could be strategic, especially since no one has bid yet and we're starting fresh.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have the digits 12073963, which means I have one 3 and no 5s or higher digits relevant to the current bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 5s, I think the count of 5s is likely less than 4 across all players, but I need to consider the total count and the fact that there are 2 other players. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit, making it harder for others to know my hand's specifics. However, I should also assess the likelihood of the current bid being true. Given that there are 24 total digits and the bid is 4 5s, it's plausible. I'll choose to bid higher by increasing the digit.

Given that I have three 6s and there are 24 digits in total, it's plausible that there could be at least 4 or more 6s among all players. However, bidding higher than '4 6s' directly might be risky without knowing the exact distribution of digits among other players. Considering the history, players have been somewhat aggressive with their bids, and challenges have been made on bids that seemed unlikely given the context.

Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 6s and I have two 6s in my hand, increasing the quantity seems risky without knowing the exact distribution of 6s among other players. However, since the total number of digits remaining is 24 and we are down to 3 players, each with 8 digits, the maximum number of any digit can be 8 (if one player has all of one digit, which is unlikely) but more realistically, it's distributed. Considering the history, bids have been relatively conservative and accurate, suggesting players are making informed decisions based on their hands. Given that I have two 6s, and the bid is already at 4 6s, challenging seems like a safer option because if I bid higher, I risk losing if my bid is challenged. Challenging allows me to capitalize on the potential overestimation by Player 4 without exposing myself to a potential loss by overbidding.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand. A bid of 3 5s is valid since I already hold three 5s, making the total count across both players at least three (even if Player 0 has none). This guarantees the bid is truthful and forces Player 0 to either challenge (which they would lose) or make a higher bid. This is a low-risk, high-certainty move compared to challenging the 2 8s bid, which requires guessing Player 0's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 5s and my hand 08108366, I have no 5s. Since I need to make a bid higher than 3 5s, I must consider either increasing the quantity or the digit. With my hand, I notice I have multiple 6s and 8s, but no 5s or higher digits. The safest increase would be to bid on a digit I have, but since I must exceed the current bid, I'll consider the digit 6 or 8. Given that the current bid is on 5s and I have no 5s, challenging seems risky without more information. However, bidding on 6s or 8s could be viable. Since I have two 8s and one 6 (with another player's bid history suggesting a possible presence of more 6s or 8s), I could take a chance on these digits. But, considering the need for a higher bid and the uncertainty of the other player's hand, I should choose the higher digit I have, which is 8, to increase the chance of winning. Thus, bidding 4 8s seems like a reasonable strategy, hoping that between the two of us, we have at least four 8s.
