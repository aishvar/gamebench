Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no previous bids. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 81604575, which contains a variety of digits. I see I have two 5s, which is a relatively high count for a single digit in my hand. A reasonable starting bid could be based on the digit with the highest count in my hand. Since I have two 5s, bidding '2 5s' seems like a conservative and reasonable starting point.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s, which seems reasonable. I have one 5 in my hand. Given the total digits remaining, I can increase the quantity to 3 and the digit to 5, making it a valid bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. On average, there should be about 4.8 of each digit (48 / 10). A bid of 3 5s is below this average and seems quite plausible, especially since Player 0 started with 2 5s. My hand has one 5, so it's reasonable to assume there are at least a couple more among the other 5 players. Bidding 4 5s is a slight increase and still well within the realm of possibility given the average distribution and the previous bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 5s' by Player 2, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have the digits '10192102', I notice there are no 5s in my hand, but there are two 1s and other digits. However, I should consider the total number of digits remaining (48) and the fact that increasing the quantity further for the digit 5 might not be feasible given the number of players and their secret digits. Considering the digits in my hand, I could try to increase the digit value since increasing the quantity of 5s seems risky without knowing other players' hands. I see that bidding on a higher digit like '6s' could be a safer option, considering the distribution of digits might favor lower numbers due to the nature of the game starting with bids on '5s'. Thus, I will choose to bid on '6s' with a quantity that seems reasonable given my hand and the total number of digits remaining.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 53126412, which contains one 6. The current bid is 4 6s by Player 3. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an average of about 4.8 of each digit is expected across all hands. Since I only have one 6, it’s possible but not highly likely that there are at least 3 more 6s among the other 40 digits. However, the bid of 4 6s is still within a reasonable range given the total digits. I’ll choose to make a higher bid rather than challenge, as challenging seems risky at this stage. I’ll bid 5 6s to increase the quantity and test the confidence of the other players.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (from 81604575). The total count of 6s must be at least 2 (mine) plus some from other players. Since there are 5 other players with 8 digits each, it's plausible that there are more 6s. However, bidding significantly higher without knowing others' hands is risky. I can either challenge or make a slightly higher bid. Given that I have two 6s and there are 5 other players, bidding 7 6s is reasonable as it slightly increases the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains two 6s. The current bid is 8 6s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. On average, you'd expect about 4.8 of any given digit (48/10). A bid of 8 6s is significantly higher than average. While it's possible, it's getting to the point where it's risky. However, I have two 6s, which supports a higher bid on 6s. Bidding 9 6s is a direct increase and seems plausible given I have two. Bidding on a different digit would require a lower quantity, which is not allowed at this point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '9 6s' and the fact that I have two 1s and no 6s in my hand, it seems unlikely that there are 9 or more 6s among all players. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48 and we are already at a high quantity for a single digit, challenging the current bid appears to be a reasonable strategy. My hand does not provide any direct insight into the likelihood of the current bid being true, but considering the bidding history and the total number of digits remaining, challenging to verify the validity of the bid '9 6s' is my best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current state of the game with no bids yet and my hand being 10192102, I have two 1s, two 0s, one 9, one 2. Since I'm starting the bidding, I need to make a bid that is reasonable yet not too high. Considering the total digits remaining are 40 and there are 5 players, I should start with a relatively low quantity and a low digit to minimize the risk. Bidding on 1s seems like a good starting point because I have two of them, and it's a low digit, making it more likely to have at least a few across all players' hands.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 53126412, which contains three 1s. The current bid by Player 3 is 3 1s. Since I already have three 1s in my hand, the bid is met just by my digits alone, making it very likely to be true or exceeded across all players. I should make a higher bid. I can increase the quantity to 4 and stay with digit 1, as it's plausible with 40 total digits. Alternatively, I could switch to a higher digit, but since I have strength in 1s, I'll bid 4 1s to keep the pressure on others while staying within a believable range.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. I could bid 5 1s. However, I also have two 7s. I could bid 5 7s, which would be a higher bid and potentially safer given my hand. Since I don't have any 1s, I'm going to go with 5 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have the digits 81604575, which includes one 7. With 40 total digits and 5 players, it's plausible that there are at least 5 sevens. However, I can bid higher. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 7 and there are 4 other players, it's possible they have more 7s. Bidding 6 7s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, bidding 5 8s is also an option as it keeps the same quantity but increases the digit. Given the information, bidding 5 8s is a safer choice as it doesn't increase the quantity, making it less likely to be challenged.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 6 8s and considering the total digits remaining (40), I need to assess the likelihood of this bid being true. With 8 digits per player and 5 active players, the maximum number of any digit can be 40 (if all players had the same digit repeated). Since I have two 1s and no 8s in my hand (10192102), and looking at the bidding history, there's been a progression towards higher bids on different digits. The jump to 6 8s seems plausible but requires careful consideration. Given that I don't have any 8s and considering the distribution might not heavily favor 8s across all players, challenging seems like a viable option, especially since the next possible bid (7 8s or any bid on a higher digit) would be quite high and risky without more information.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current state of the game with no bids yet and considering my hand (10192102), I notice that I have two 1s, two 0s, two 2s, and one 9. Since there are no previous bids in this round to build upon or challenge, I must make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, bidding on a digit I have the most of could be a good strategy. I have multiple 1s and 0s, but since the goal is to bid on a total count across all players' hands, I should consider what is likely to be present in other players' hands as well. Given that 1 and 0 are common starting digits and might be more prevalent, I could start with one of these. However, without any information on other players' hands, I'll choose a digit that I have multiple of and seems less likely to be overly abundant, thus making my bid somewhat conservative but plausible. Bidding on 1s or 0s could be a good starting point, but considering I have two of each and the total number of digits remaining is 32, I might start with a lower quantity to avoid immediate challenge. Since I have two 1s, I could bid on 1s, aiming for a quantity that seems achievable given the total number of players and digits.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 53126412, which contains three 1s. The current bid is 4 1s by Player 3. Since I already have three 1s in my hand, it's plausible that there is at least one more 1 among the other 24 digits across the remaining players (total 32 digits). The probability seems reasonable, as with 24 digits left, even if distributed evenly, there could easily be another 1. However, I need to make a higher bid. I can bid 5 1s, but that feels risky since I'm only contributing three. Alternatively, I can switch to a higher digit with a reasonable quantity. My hand also has one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, and one 6. Bidding on 4 2s keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, which is a safer incremental bid. I think this is a reasonable move without overextending.

Given that there are 32 total digits and I have 8 of them, there are 24 digits left among the other players. It's possible they have more 7s, but bidding too high might be challenging to believe. I can see that my hand has a good number of diverse digits, but not an unusually high number of 7s. The bid of 5 7s is relatively conservative considering the total count of digits. I will increase the quantity to make a higher bid. Bidding 6 7s seems reasonable as it is a small increase in quantity.

Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 6 7s and my hand 10192102, I have one 7. Considering the total digits remaining are 32 and there are only 4 active players, each having 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 32. Since the current bid is 6 7s, to make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. However, increasing the quantity to 7 or more seems risky given the total number of digits and the fact that I only have one 7. Bidding on a higher digit than 7 is not possible since 7 is the highest digit that has been bid on and 8, 9 would require a significant number of those digits to be present. Given the risk and the fact that I have only one 7, challenging the current bid seems like a reasonable option, as it's uncertain whether there are indeed at least 6 sevens among all players.

Since the game has just started with 3 players and 24 total digits, and I have two '1's, bidding on '1's seems like a safe start. I will bid on the quantity of '1's I have plus one, to account for potential '1's in other players' hands, making my bid '3 1s'.

Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '5 2s' and my hand '10192102', I notice I have one 2. Considering the total digits remaining is 24 and there are only 3 active players, each with 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 24. Since the bid '5 2s' is not extremely high and I have a 2 in my hand, I should consider the possibility that there could be at least 5 twos among the players. However, without more information about the other players' hands, it's difficult to assess the likelihood of this bid being true. Given the history of challenges and the fact that I've successfully challenged bids before, I should think about whether '5 2s' is a reasonable expectation. Since I only have one 2 and the bid is on the lower end of possible quantities, I might lean towards challenging, but I must consider if the other players could potentially have enough 2s to make this bid valid. Considering all factors, making a higher bid seems risky without more information, so challenging seems like a viable option to test the validity of the current bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: Given that there are only 16 total digits remaining and I have 8 of them, I can see the distribution of my own digits. My hand is 10192102, which means I have two 1s, two 0s, one 9, one 2, and two other digits. Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Considering the low total number of digits and aiming for a reasonable and not overly ambitious start, bidding on a digit I have at least one of seems prudent. Given my hand, I could bid on 1s, 0s, 9s, or 2s. However, since I have two 1s and this is a starting bid, I'll choose a quantity and digit that I think is achievable and not too risky, keeping in mind the goal is to make a valid higher bid than 'None'.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 53126412, so I have two 1s. The current bid by Player 3 is 2 1s, which matches the number of 1s I have. Since there are only 16 total digits across both players, and I already account for the bid quantity, it’s possible but not guaranteed that Player 3 has no 1s or just one. However, bidding higher is safer at this stage. I can bid 3 1s, as it’s a reasonable increase and I’m contributing significantly to the count. Alternatively, I could switch to a higher digit, but since I have strength in 1s, I’ll stick with them. Challenging seems risky given I have the exact count in my hand, and Player 3 might have at least one more 1. I’ll bid higher to push the game forward.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 1s and my hand containing the digits 10192102, I have two 1s and one 2. Since I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than 3 1s, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Considering my hand and the fact that there are only 16 digits remaining, bidding on a higher digit seems more reasonable. I notice that I have two 2s in my hand (considering the digits I have), which gives me a good foundation to bid on 2s. Therefore, I can bid on 2s with a quantity that is the same as the current bid's quantity, which would be a valid higher bid because 2 is greater than 1.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 53126412, which contains two 1s, two 2s, and one each of 3, 4, 5, and 6. The current bid by Player 3 is 3 2s. In my hand, I have two 2s, so it's possible that Player 3 has one or more 2s to make the total at least 3. With only 16 total digits between us, I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Challenging 3 2s feels risky since it's a low quantity and plausible given I have two 2s myself. Instead, I can make a higher bid. I could bid 4 2s, but that might be pushing it since I only have two 2s. Alternatively, I can switch to a higher digit with the same quantity. I have one 3, so bidding 3 3s is a safer incremental increase. This keeps the bid low enough to be believable while still being higher than the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 3s' by Player 4 and my hand '10192102', I notice I have one '3'. Since the total number of digits remaining is 16 and we are down to two players, each with 8 digits, the maximum count for any digit is 16. Considering the bidding history and the fact that I have to make a strictly higher bid, I could consider increasing the quantity or the digit. However, given that the digit '3' has just been bid and I only have one '3', increasing the quantity to '4' for the same digit seems risky without knowing more about Player 4's hand. On the other hand, challenging the bid could be a good strategy if I believe the actual count of '3s' is less than 3, considering my own hand and the elimination history. Since my hand does not provide a clear advantage for bidding higher on '3s' and given the history of successful challenges, I should consider the likelihood of '3s' being less than 3 across both hands.
