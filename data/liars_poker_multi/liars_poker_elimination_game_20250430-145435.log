Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning no bid has been made yet. I have four 1s in my hand. A conservative but valid opening bid would be 1 1s. This is a safe starting point to gauge other players' hands.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 1s. I have a 3 in my hand, so bidding 1 3s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid. This is a minimal and safe increment given my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 1 3s. I have no 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s, or 9s to make a higher bid with a higher digit. I do have three 0s, but I don't know how many 0s the other players have. I could bid 2 3s, but this is risky because I only have one 3. Challenging seems too risky because I have a 3 in my hand. Bidding 2 0s is a reasonable move because it increases the quantity and I have three 0s in my hand, making it a safer bid than 2 3s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have one 7 in my hand and no zeros, so I cannot support an increase in zeros. The next valid bid must be higher than 2 0s, so either 3 of any digit or 2 of a higher digit than 0. I have two 7s, which is a decent digit to bid on. Bidding 2 7s is a valid and reasonable move to increase the bid while reflecting some confidence from my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (81360149), I have zero 7s. The current bid is '2 7s', which means Player 3 is claiming there are at least 2 sevens among all players. Since I don't have any 7s, this means the other 5 players would need to have at least 2 sevens among them, which is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's a risky move this early in the game when the bid is quite reasonable. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have one 8 in my hand, so I could bid '2 8s' (same quantity but higher digit). I also have one 9 in my hand, so I could bid '2 9s'. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to '3' with a lower digit. Since I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, and one 6 in my hand, I have some flexibility. I'll bid '3 0s' since I have one 0 in my hand, and it's reasonable to expect at least 2 more zeros among the other 40 digits held by other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s made by Player 4. Since I have the digits 6, 2, 5, 1, 7, 2, 8, 5, I have at least two 0s (none in my hand). The total number of 0s across all players could be at most 6 (if every player had a 0), but the current bid is 3 0s, which is plausible. Bidding higher on 0s seems risky because I have no 0s, and increasing the digit to 1 would require at least 4 1s, which I do not have. Alternatively, I can challenge, as the previous bid might be overestimating the total number of 0s, especially given my hand and the bidding history. Challenging seems the safer move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I'm starting this round, so I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (81360149), I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 8, and one 9. Since I have one 0 in my hand, and in the previous round there were at least 4 zeros total (as revealed when my bid was challenged), it's reasonable to assume there are still several zeros in play. The other players have 32 digits combined, and I know one of those digits is a 0. I'll start with a conservative bid of 3 0s, which worked well for me in the previous round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Player 4 just bid 3 0s, and Player 5 lost challenging that bid, meaning there *are* at least 3 0s in the remaining hands. I have no 0s in my hand. Bidding higher on 0s would be foolish. I have four 1s. Bidding 4 1s is a reasonable and safe increase in quantity, as it's higher than the current bid of 3 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. My hand contains no 1s, and the expected number of 1s in the remaining 32 digits is 3.2, making the bid slightly above average. Bidding 4 3s leverages my one 3 in hand, with an expected 3.2 3s in others' hands, totaling ~4.2. This is a safer bid than challenging, as the current bid has a non-negligible chance of being correct.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 4s and two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 3s. I could bid 5 3s, but that seems risky. Bidding 4 4s is a reasonable move, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Challenging seems unlikely to succeed, as Player 1 might have some 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. Since I only have one 4, bidding 5 4s seems risky. I have two 7s, so bidding 4 7s is a valid higher bid with the same quantity but higher digit. This is a reasonable bid given my hand and the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. My hand contains 81360149, which has one 7. The current bid is 4 7s, meaning Player 3 thinks there are at least 4 sevens among all players. Since I have 1 seven, there would need to be at least 3 more sevens among the other 4 players. This is certainly possible, but not guaranteed. Looking at the bidding pattern, players have been cautious, only incrementing the digit while keeping the quantity at 4. This suggests they might not have strong hands for those digits. I could bid 4 8s, as I have one 8 in my hand, or 5 0s, 5 1s, or 5 3s since I have those digits in my hand. Given that I have one 8, bidding 4 8s seems safest while keeping the quantity the same. If I'm challenged, I need only 3 more 8s among other players, which is reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 8s seems risky without knowing other players' hands. I can either bid 5 0s, 5 1s, ..., 5 9s or bid 4 9s. Considering I have four 1s, bidding 5 1s is a plausible option. However, given the previous rounds and the elimination of Player 5 for underbidding, challenging seems more strategic. 4 8s seems high given only 40 total digits remaining and 5 players. It's likely someone is bluffing.

Player 4 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding in this round with 4 active players, each having 8 digits. Looking at my hand (81360149), I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 8, and one 9. Since I have a 0 in my hand, and I successfully bid 3 0s in previous rounds (which proved there were at least 4 zeros total), it's reasonable to start with a similar bid. However, I should be slightly conservative at the beginning to avoid an immediate challenge. I'll bid 2 0s, which I know is safe given my hand contains one 0.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, so the minimum possible total is 1. Challenging would risk elimination if others have at least one 0 (likely given 32 total digits). Bidding 2 3s is a safer higher bid since I have one 3 in my hand and others may have another, making the bid plausible without overextending.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 3s in my hand, and the last bid was 2 3s. However, challenging might be risky as there are 31 digits remaining, and the bid is relatively low. I have two 4s and two 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 4s is a reasonable increase in both quantity and digit, and it's likely that there are at least three 4s among all players' hands.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I must bid higher, meaning at least 3 5s or 4 of any digit. I have one 5 and one 7 in my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a minimal increase in digit and seems reasonable given my hand. Bidding 3 5s is more believable than increasing quantity to 4, which might be riskier.

Player 4 Reasoning: Looking at my hand '81360149', I have no 5s. Player 3 has bid '3 5s', which means they're claiming there are at least 3 fives among all 32 digits. Since I don't have any 5s, all 3 would need to come from the other three players' hands (24 digits total). This is certainly possible. I could bid '3 6s', but I only have one 6 in my hand, which makes this risky. I could bid '3 7s', but I don't have any 7s. I could also bid '3 8s', which is safer since I have one 8 in my hand. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to '4' of a digit I have multiple of, like '4 0s' or '4 1s', but I only have one of each. Given my hand, I think bidding '3 8s' is reasonable - it's the minimum valid bid that leverages what I have in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have no 8s in my hand, and the expected number of 8s across three players is 2.4, making the bid slightly risky. Bidding 3 9s increases the digit while maintaining a similar expected count (2.4 for 9s), which is more likely to hold true than increasing the quantity. Challenging carries a 42% chance of success, but bidding 3 9s is a safer, higher bid given the game's history of correct bids.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I must bid at least 4 of a digit higher than 8 or increase the quantity. The next valid bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, so bidding 4 9s is reasonable. Bidding higher quantity of 0s or 1s seems riskier given previous bids. Challenging now might be premature since 4 8s was just made and 8s are fairly common.

Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. My hand is 81360149, which contains one 9. The current bid is 4 9s, meaning there need to be at least 4 nines total among all players. I have 1, so there would need to be 3 more among the other three players. This is possible but not guaranteed. Looking at the bidding pattern, Player 3 increased Player 2's bid of 4 8s to 4 9s, suggesting they might have at least one 9. From previous rounds, I've shown confidence in 0s and 8s. I have one 0 and one 8 in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, but that seems risky without knowing other players' hands. I could also bid 5 1s since I have one 1, but again, that's speculative. Given that I only have one 9 and the bid is for 4 9s, I think challenging is the safer move here. If there are fewer than 4 nines total, I'll eliminate Player 3.

Player 4 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of this round. Looking at my hand (81360149), I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 8, and one 9. Since I have one 0 and I know from the previous round that Player 2 likely has at least one 0 (they bid 2 0s early), I could reasonably bid 2 0s. However, I also have one 1, and Player 1 previously bid 4 1s, suggesting there might be multiple 1s in play. My safest bet is to start with a conservative bid based on what I actually have in my hand. I'll bid 2 1s since I have one 1 and it's reasonable to expect at least one more 1 among the other 16 digits held by other players.

Player 4 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge Player 2's bid of 4 8s. Looking at my hand (81360149), I have one 8. For Player 2's bid to be valid, there would need to be at least 3 more 8s between the other two players' hands. Each player has 8 digits, so there are 16 digits in the other players' hands combined. The probability of having at least 3 more 8s in 16 random digits is not extremely low. However, Player 2 has made this bid immediately after I successfully challenged Player 3's bid of 4 9s in the previous round. This could be a bluff trying to intimidate me. Given that I have one 8 in my hand, and need to account for 3 more 8s in 16 digits (which is possible but not highly probable), I'll make a higher bid rather than challenge. I'll bid 5 0s since I have one 0 in my hand, and it's a reasonable increase in quantity.

Player 1 Reasoning: As the first bid in the final round, I need to start with a plausible bid based on my hand. I have two 5s, so bidding 3 5s is reasonable, assuming Player 2 has at least one 5. This bid is conservative but leverages my existing digits to create a believable claim.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, which is the current bid digit. The previous bid was 3 5s. I can confidently bid 4 5s, increasing the quantity while keeping the same digit. This is a safe bid because even if the other player has no 5s, I still have two, making the total at least 4. Additionally, challenging seems risky since the bid is relatively low and could easily be true.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:5 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have two 5s in my hand. The probability that Player 2 has at least two 5s (to make the total 4) is low (~18.7%) based on random distribution. Challenging is more likely to succeed as the bid is statistically improbable.
