Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 47675105, which contains a variety of digits. I have a total of 2 fives, 1 seven, 1 six, 1 four, 1 zero, and 1 one. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the distribution of my digits and considering the total number of digits (48) across all players. I will start by bidding on a digit that I have, and '3 5s' seems like a conservative and reasonable starting point given that I have two 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. With 5 other players, it's possible that there are at least two more 5s among them, making the current bid of 3 5s plausible. To stay competitive, I'll increase the digit to 6, which I have two of in my hand, suggesting a higher likelihood of more 6s in the pool.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 55095626, which contains two 6s. The current bid is 3 6s by Player 1. Since I have two 6s myself, it's plausible that there is at least one more 6 among the other 40 digits across the 5 other players. With a total of 48 digits, the expected number of any digit is around 4.8, so 3 6s seems reasonable. I will make a higher bid to continue the game. Iâ€™ll bid 4 6s, increasing the quantity, as I believe it's still within a plausible range given my own contribution to the count.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s. Bidding 4 7s is a valid higher bid, as it maintains the same quantity but increases the digit, leveraging my hand's 7.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:0 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 3. I have the digits 0, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5 in my hand. I see that there are 48 total digits and each player has 8 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. I have one 1 and no 7s. Given that I need to make a bid higher than 4 7s, I should consider bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit. Since I don't have any 7s but have multiple 1s, and considering the distribution of digits, bidding 5 1s seems reasonable as it's higher in quantity than 4 7s and I can support it with my hand.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:4 - claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge Player 4's bid of '5 1s'. Looking at my hand (02799621), I have only one '1' digit. With 6 players having 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For Player 4's bid to be valid, there need to be at least 5 ones in total. I already know I have 1 one, so there would need to be at least 4 more ones among the other 5 players, which is certainly possible (less than 1 per player on average). The bid isn't unreasonable, so I should make a higher bid. I can either bid '6 1s' or switch to a different digit with a quantity of at least 5. Looking at my hand, I have two '9's, one '7', one '6', one '2', one '0', and no '3's, '4's, '5's, or '8's. Since I have two '9's, I could reasonably bid '5 9s', which is higher than '5 1s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. My hand is 47675105, which contains one 9. The total count of 9s across all players must be at least 6 (since I have one). Bidding 6 9s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity. I will bid 6 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 6 9s, which is quite high considering there are only 48 digits in total. Given that there are 6 players, each with 8 digits, the likelihood of there being at least 6 9s is low. Since I only have one, it's probable that the bid is too high. Therefore, I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None' as we are starting a new round. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 47675105, which contains two 5s and one 7. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and the total number of digits. With 40 total digits across 5 players, bidding 7 5s seems like a good starting point as it reflects a moderate quantity and a digit I have seen in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 55095626, which contains three 5s. The current bid is 7 5s by Player 0. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, it's plausible that there are at least 7 5s across all hands, especially since I already have 3. I don't think challenging is wise given my contribution to the count. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Since the bid is already on 5s with a quantity of 7, I'll increase the quantity to 8 and stay on 5s, as I have a strong hand for this digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 5s. With 40 total digits across 5 players, the expected number of 5s is 4 (10% chance per digit). Bidding 8 5s is significantly higher than expected, suggesting a bluff. Challenging this bid is reasonable as it's unlikely the actual count meets the requirement. My hand contains one 5, which further supports the likelihood of the bid being false.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid that reflects my hand's composition. Bidding 2 9s is a logical first move, as it accurately represents the quantity of 9s I hold.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:0 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s made by Player 3. I have one 9 in my hand. Given that there are 3 other active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total possible count for 9s could be high but is unlikely to be exactly 2 given the distribution. However, I do not have enough information to be certain it's a lie. I should bid higher to test the claim.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand (02799621). The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 4. With 32 total digits in play and 4 active players, I need to estimate if there's likely to be at least 3 9s total. I already have 2 of them, so we only need 1 more 9 among the other 3 players' 24 digits, which is quite likely. I could safely bid 4 0s or 4 1s, but I think I'll challenge since I have a good count of the specific digit in question (9s) and if there are exactly 3 9s total, challenging would be optimal. However, since I already have 2 9s myself, and only 1 more 9 is needed among 24 remaining digits to make the bid valid, the probability favors the bid being valid. Therefore, I should make a higher bid instead. I have a 0 and a 1 in my hand, so I'll bid 4 0s to increase the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. My hand is 47675105, which contains one 0. With 32 total digits and 3 other players, I can estimate the likelihood of the bid being correct. Since I have one 0, there are 31 remaining digits. A bid of 4 0s implies that there are at least four 0s in total. Given that I have one 0, there need to be at least three more 0s among the remaining 24 digits (since 8 digits * 3 players = 24 digits). This seems somewhat plausible but is on the higher side. However, bidding 4 1s is a possible move as it increases the digit. I will bid 4 1s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 4 1s. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid since it maintains the same quantity but uses a higher digit. This leverages my hand's 9s and challenges the current bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 3. I have 2 nines in my hand. Given that there are 3 other active players, the total count of 9s could be higher. However, bidding 5 9s would be a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity. But first, I should assess if challenging is more beneficial. With 32 total digits and 4 players, the maximum possible count for any digit is 32. Given that I have 2 nines and there are 3 other players, it's possible but unlikely that there are 4 or more nines in total. I will make a bid instead of challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Player 4 has bid 5 9s, which means they believe there are at least 5 nines among all players. I know I have 2 of them, so there would need to be at least 3 more 9s among the other three players. This is possible but somewhat high. Each player has 8 digits, and if the distribution is roughly uniform, we'd expect about 3.2 digits of each type (0-9) among all 32 digits. The bid of 5 9s is above this average, but not unreasonably so. I could challenge, but it's risky. Alternatively, I could raise to 6 9s (which would be a bluff since I only know of 2), or I could switch to a higher digit. Since I don't have any other digits in high quantities in my hand, I'll play it safe and challenge the current bid of 5 9s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I'm starting this round, so I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (02799621), I have two 9s, one 7, one 6, one 2, one 0, and one 1. Since I have two 9s in my hand, that's a good starting point. With 3 players and 8 digits each, there are 24 total digits in play. A conservative first bid would be to claim there are at least 2 of my strongest digit (9s) across all hands. This is guaranteed to be true since I already have 2 in my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with two active players, and there are 16 digits in total. My hand is 47675105, which contains two 5s, two 1s, one 7, one 6, and one 0. Since there's no current bid, I need to make the first bid. A reasonable starting point is to bid on a digit that I have in my hand. I have two 5s, so bidding on 5s seems like a good strategy. The total count of 5s across both players must be at least 2 (the number I have), so bidding 4 5s is a conservative estimate, considering there are 8 digits per player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have 8 digits in my hand (02799621) and there are 16 total digits in play between me and Player 0. The current bid is 4 5s, meaning Player 0 is claiming there are at least 4 fives total. Looking at my hand, I have 0 fives. For the bid to be true, Player 0 would need to have at least 4 fives in their hand of 8 digits. While possible, this seems somewhat unlikely as it would require half of their hand to be fives. Given my hand has two 9s, I could bid 4 9s. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to 5 of a lower digit. Since I have one 6, I could bid 5 6s, but that's risky. I think challenging is the better option here since I have no 5s and the opponent would need at least 4 in their hand of 8 digits.
