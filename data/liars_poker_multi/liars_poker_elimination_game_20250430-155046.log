Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, which is a relatively common digit. Since there are 6 players each with 8 digits, there are 48 digits total. Starting the bidding with a modest bid like 3 8s is reasonable to begin the game and sets a baseline for others to respond to.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, and raising to 3 9s (same quantity, higher digit) is valid. I only need one more 9 among the 40 unknown digits, which is very likely, so this is a safe minimal increase.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 9s in my hand. There are 40 unknown digits among the other players, with an expected ~4 additional 9s, making at least three 9s very likely. Rather than challenge, I should raise the bid. To remain strong, I’ll bid 4 9s, since needing two more 9s from the unknown is still over a 90% probability.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (73202295), meaning only three more 9s are needed among the other 40 digits (5 players) for the bid to be true. The expected number of 9s across all 48 digits is 4.8, so 4 is a plausible, relatively low bid, making a challenge risky. I should consider making a higher bid. My hand contains three 2s, which is a strong count for a single digit. The next possible quantity is 5. Bidding 5 2s requires only two more 2s among the other 40 digits. Given the statistical average would be four 2s in those 40 digits, needing only two makes this a very safe and strong bid based on my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s made by Player 4. I have the hand 27338262, which contains two 3s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand only contains two 3s, I can try to bid on a higher digit. I see that my hand has two 6s, and there are no bids on 6s yet. I can make a bid of 2 6s, which is a higher digit than 3s and a reasonable quantity based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s made by Player 4. I have 8 secret digits: 27338262. I count one 3 in my hand. Considering the total digits remaining (48) and that there are 6 players, each having 8 digits, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. The bid of 5 3s seems potentially high but not extremely unlikely. However, I do not have enough information about other players' hands. I will increase the quantity slightly and bid on a digit that I have in my hand. I have two 6s, so bidding 6 3s or a higher digit seems reasonable. Since 3 is a relatively low digit and I have one 3, I could challenge or bid higher. I choose to bid higher on a digit I have.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s, which means at least six 6s exist among all players' hands. I have no 6s in my hand, only one 8 and one 9. The bid is quite high, but still plausible given there are 48 digits total. To raise, I must bid at least 6 7s or 7 of any digit. I have one 8 and one 9, so bidding 6 7s is risky since I have no 7s, but bidding 6 7s is the minimum higher bid. Bidding 7 2s or 7 3s would be a bigger jump and riskier. I will bid 6 7s to keep the bid reasonable and maintain pressure.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The bid of 6 7s requires at least five more 7s among the other 40 unknown digits. The probability of that is only about 37%, so there’s roughly a 63% chance the bid is false. I should challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand and the expected total number of 9s among all 40 digits is about 4, so bidding 3 9s is a conservative opening bid that I can confidently support.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The probability that there are fewer than three 9s total (i.e., none among the other 32 cards) is only about 3%, so challenging is unlikely to win. Bidding 4 9s uses the two I hold and has a high probability (around 84%) of being correct, making it a strong play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (73202295). This means the other 4 players need 3 more 9s among their 32 digits for the bid to be true. Since 4 is the expected average number of any digit across all 40 digits, and two players have already bid on 9s, challenging seems risky. I need to make a higher bid, which must be at least quantity 5. Looking at my hand, I have three 2s. Bidding 5 2s requires only 2 more 2s among the remaining 32 digits held by other players. This is a statistically plausible and safe bid based on my strong holding of 2s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. My hand has no 2s, and with 40 total digits across 5 players, the likelihood of at least 5 2s is low. Challenging this bid is reasonable as it may expose a lie, especially given previous challenges succeeded in similar scenarios.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I am Player 3 and I start the bidding this round. My hand is 73202295, containing three 2s. There are 4 players and 32 total digits. The expected average count for any digit is 3.2. Having three 2s makes this my strongest digit. In the previous round (with 40 digits), my bid of 5 2s was challenged and won, with the actual count being 7. Scaling that down to 32 digits (7 * 32/40 = 5.6) suggests that 5 2s is still a very plausible quantity. Starting with 5 2s leverages my hand strength and the history of the previous successful bid, putting immediate pressure on the next player.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s made by Player 3. I have the hand 27338262, which contains two 2s. Given that there are 32 total digits remaining across 4 players, the maximum possible count for any digit is 32. The bid of 5 2s seems plausible but I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. Since I have two 2s, I can see that bidding higher on 2s or another digit is possible. However, challenging seems risky as 5 2s could be valid given the distribution. I will bid higher on a digit I have, increasing the quantity.

Since I must start the bidding and my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider what seems plausible given my hand and the total digits remaining (24).

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 73202295, which contains three 2s. The current bid by Player 5 is 2 2s. There are 16 total digits between Player 5 and me. Since I have three 2s myself, I know for certain that the total count of 2s is at least 3. Therefore, challenging the bid of '2 2s' would result in an immediate loss for me, as the actual count (>=3) is greater than or equal to the bid (2). I must make a higher bid. The next possible bids are '2 3s' or higher digits with quantity 2, or '3 0s' or higher quantities. Given that I hold three 2s, the safest and most logical next bid is '3 2s'. This bid is guaranteed to be true based on my hand alone and forces Player 5 to make a significantly higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s made by Player 3. I have 2 2s in my hand, and there are 16 total digits remaining across both players' hands. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we both have 8 digits, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. Since Player 3 bid 3 2s, and I have 2 2s, it's possible that Player 3 has at least one 2. However, bidding 4 2s seems risky without knowing Player 3's hand. I can see that bidding a higher digit with a low quantity might be safer. I have 2 2s, 2 6s, and other digits. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and might be more likely given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s by Player 5. I have zero 6s in my hand (73202295). For the bid to be true, Player 5 must hold at least three 6s out of their 8 digits. While possible, this is uncertain. Instead of challenging, I can make a strong bid based on my hand. I hold three 2s. I previously bid 3 2s, and Player 5 escalated to 3 6s instead of challenging or raising the bid on 2s. Bidding 4 2s is a strong move because I already hold three 2s, meaning Player 5 only needs to hold one 2 for the bid to be accurate (total count >= 4). This is statistically likely (Player 5 has 8 unknown digits out of the remaining 8). This bid puts significant pressure on Player 5, forcing them to either make a riskier higher bid or challenge my likely true bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s made by Player 3. I have the hand 27338262, which contains three 2s and two 6s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total for both players and my hand already contains three 2s, it's possible that Player 3's bid of 4 2s could be valid if they have at least one 2. However, I also have two 6s, and there are no bids on 6s yet. A bid of 3 6s seems reasonable and higher than 4 2s in terms of digit value. But to strictly follow the rules, I need a bid that is higher in quantity or digit value. Since 3 6s is higher in digit value but not quantity, and I don't think I can make a valid higher quantity bid on 2s, I should consider challenging if I think 4 2s is unlikely.
