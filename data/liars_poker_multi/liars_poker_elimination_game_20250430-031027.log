Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the bidding and there are no previous bids to consider, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 82747824, I notice that I have two 8s and two 7s, but also two 2s and two 4s. Since I have to make a bid that is strictly higher than 'None', I should start with a relatively safe and moderate bid. Considering the total number of digits is 48 and there are 6 players, bidding on a digit that I have at least one of seems prudent. I'll choose a digit I have in my hand and a quantity that seems achievable given the total number of digits in play. Bidding on the 2s or 4s could be a good start since I have two of each, but considering the need to balance between being too conservative and too aggressive, I decide to bid on one of these digits with a quantity that reflects my hand's composition without being too revealing.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. My hand is 85638391, which contains zero 2s. While having no 2s makes the bid slightly less likely from my perspective, 4 is not an excessively high bid for 6 players and 48 total digits (average expected count is 4.8). Challenging carries risk. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). I have two 8s in my hand, making a bid of 4 8s relatively safe, as it only requires two more 8s from the other 5 players, which is well within the realm of probability.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 1. My hand contains two 5s, one 9, one 1, four 4s, and one 2. Given that I have only one 8 in my hand and the total digits are 48, it is unlikely that there are at least 4 eights across all players. Challenging the bid seems the most strategic move to attempt to eliminate Player 1.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round. My hand is 85638391, which contains two 8s and two 3s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected count for any digit is 40 * (1/10) = 4. Based on my two 8s, the total expected count of 8s is 2 (mine) + 32 * (1/10) (others) = 5.2. Bidding 5 8s is a reasonable starting bid based on this expectation and my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. With 5 players and 40 digits total, the average count for any digit is 4. A bid of 5 8s is slightly above average but not impossible. I can make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 6 6s is a significant increase in quantity and a lower digit, which is a valid higher bid. It's a plausible bid based on my hand and the number of remaining digits.

Player 4 Reasoning: There are no bids yet, so I'll start with a bid based on my hand. I have 0 8s and 1 0 and 1 1, but no 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, or 9s. Given the lack of information and no previous bids, I'll bid on the digit 1, which is the only digit I have, with a quantity of 1.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 2 0s and I have the hand 82747824, which does not contain any zeros, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least two zeros among all active players. Since each player has 8 digits and there are 4 active players, the total number of digits in play is 32. The presence of two zeros is plausible but not guaranteed. However, considering the bidding history and the fact that no one has bid on zeros before, it might be a strategic move to challenge this bid, especially since my hand does not contribute to the count of zeros. Challenging allows me to potentially eliminate a player without having to make a risky bid myself.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid of 1 0s is very low and highly likely to be true given there are 24 total digits in play. Challenging this bid is risky. My hand contains two 8s. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable increase based on my hand and the total number of digits, requiring only one additional 8 from the other 16 digits held by opponents.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. Bidding higher on 8s seems risky. Since there are only 24 digits total, a bid of 6 8s or higher seems unlikely. I will bid 5 9s as it is a safe increase and doesn't rely on me having a specific digit.

Player 5 bids: 5 9s

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:4 - openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. My hand contains one 9. There are 24 total digits across 3 players. This means there are 16 unknown digits held by the other two players. For the bid of 5 9s to be true, at least 4 more 9s must exist among these 16 unknown digits. The probability of this occurring by chance is low (approximately 6.83%). Conversely, there is a high probability (over 93%) that the actual count of 9s is less than 5. Making a higher bid (e.g., 6 of any digit) would require an even more unlikely concentration of that digit in the other hands. Challenging the current bid presents the highest probability of winning the round based on the available information.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With a total of 16 digits in play across two players, bidding '3 8s' is a plausible opening bid. It requires only one additional 8 from my opponent's 8 digits, which is a likely scenario. This bid is based on my strongest digit count and is a reasonable starting point for the round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand contains two 8s. For the bid to be true, Player 4 must have at least 4 - 2 = 2 eights in their hand of 8 digits. The probability of Player 4 having two or more 8s in 8 random digits is relatively low (approximately 19%). This means there is a high probability (approximately 81%) that Player 4 has fewer than two 8s, making the total count of 8s less than 4. Given the high likelihood that the bid is false, challenging is the strategic move.
