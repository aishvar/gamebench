Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I should make a safe and reasonable opening bid. My hand contains two 8s, two 3s, two 6s, one 5, and one 0. With 6 players and 8 digits each, the probability of each digit appearing is roughly uniform. Starting with '2 8s' leverages my own hand strength and is a standard, non-risky opening.

Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder this round, I should make a conservative but credible opening bid. My hand contains three 8s, which is strong for that digit. An opening bid of 3 8s leverages my hand strength and is likely to be safe, given there are 40 digits in play and I hold nearly half of the minimum required for the bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, so increasing the quantity to 4 8s is a logical next step. This raises the bid's quantity while keeping the same digit, which is a valid higher bid. Challenging would risk losing if the actual count is 3 or more, which seems likely given previous bids.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand and no 8s. Raising to 4 9s uses my two 9s and requires at least two more 9s among the other 32 cards. The probability of ≥2 out of 32 being 9s is about 83%, which is significantly higher than the ~65% chance I'd have by challenging 4 8s. It’s valid to keep the quantity at 4 and raise the digit, so I should bid 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 3. I have a hand of 70878535, which contains one 9. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, the total number of digits is 40. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Since the current bid is 4 9s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. I can see that bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit could be strategic. However, I should also consider the likelihood of the current bid being true. With my hand and the possibility of other players having 9s, I will assess the risk of challenging versus bidding.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. With 4 other players, it's possible there are at least 5 0s in total, but the bid is already high. I don't have strong evidence to challenge, so I'll make a conservative bid to keep the game going.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 35063988, which contains: one 3, one 5, one 0, one 6, one 3, one 9, two 8s, and one 8 (total three 8s). The current bid is 5 1s. Since there are 40 digits in play, each digit should appear on average 4 times, but distribution can vary. I have no 1s, so the current bid is risky for me to challenge unless I believe there are fewer than five 1s among the other 32 digits. However, I have three 8s, which is a strong holding. I can safely raise the bid to 5 8s, which is a higher digit at the same quantity, and is a strong position for me.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. My hand contains two 8s, and with 40 total digits remaining, the average number of 8s across all players is 4. Since the bid requires at least 5 8s, it's plausible the actual count is lower, making this a likely lie. Challenging risks elimination but could expose the false bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round, I want to start with a strong but plausible bid. My hand contains three 8s, which is a relatively high count for a single digit. Given that there are 32 digits in play and the previous rounds have shown that 8s can be plentiful, I will start with a safe but assertive opening bid of 3 8s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand and no 8s. Raising to 3 9s (same quantity, higher digit) is valid and I only need one more 9 among the other 24 cards (~92% chance), whereas challenging 3 8s only wins ~57% of the time. Raising is safer.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 3. I have the hand 70878535, which contains one 9. Considering the total digits remaining is 32 and there are 4 active players, the maximum possible count for any digit is 32. Given that I have one 9 and there could be up to 24 more 9s distributed among the other 3 players, a bid of 3 9s seems plausible but not extremely likely. However, bidding 4 8s or higher would be a safer bet to avoid immediate challenge, but I also need to consider my own hand strength and possible challenge outcomes.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which means there are at least two more 8s among the other three players (since I have two). Given that the previous rounds showed a high count of 8s (actual count was 8 in the first round and 8 in the second round), it's plausible that there are at least four 8s in total. However, bidding higher would require going to 5 8s or 4 9s. Since I have no 9s in my hand, bidding 4 9s seems risky. Bidding 5 8s is also risky given that we're down to 32 total digits. Challenging might be premature since the bid is plausible. I'll make a conservative bid of 4 9s to keep the game going.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 35063988, which contains two 9s. The current bid is 4 9s. Since I have two 9s, there need to be at least two more among the remaining 24 digits (held by three other players) for the bid to be valid. The probability of that is reasonable but not guaranteed. However, challenging at this level is risky, as 4 out of 32 is not an extreme bid. To stay in the game and avoid an early challenge, I will make a higher bid. I have three 8s, and the bid can be raised to 4 8s (same quantity, lower digit is not allowed), or 5 8s (higher quantity, lower digit is allowed). Since the previous round, 8s have been proven strong and I have three in hand, I'll bid 5 8s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand and only 24 unknown cards remain. The expected number of 8s among them is about 2.4 and the probability of at least 5 is under 10%, making 5 8s highly unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first to act in this round and must make an opening bid. My hand is 35063988, which contains three 8s. Historically, opening bids with 2-3 of a digit have been safe and have drawn challenges that I have won, especially with 8s. Given my strong holding in 8s and the pattern of successful bids on this digit, I will open with 3 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 0. I have the hand 70878535, which contains two 8s. Given that there are only 24 total digits remaining across all players and we are down to 3 active players, I need to consider if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. My hand has two 8s, so I know there are at least 2 8s in total. However, bidding must be strictly higher than 3 8s. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and there are only 24 digits in total, bidding more than 3 of any digit seems risky without knowing others' hands. I should consider if challenging is a better option given the current bid seems plausible but not extremely high.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s. Given that there are 24 digits remaining and 3 players, it's possible that there are at least 4 8s in total. However, the previous rounds have shown a high count of 8s (8 in the first round, 8 in the second, and 6 in the third). Since I have two 8s, it's plausible that there are at least 4 8s in total. To avoid risking a challenge, I will make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 9s, which is a safer move given my hand and the history.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 35063988, which contains two 9s and three 8s. The current bid is 4 9s. For there to be at least four 9s among all 24 digits, there must be at least two more 9s among the 16 digits held by Players 4 and 5. Given the distribution, four 9s is plausible but not guaranteed. However, since I only have two 9s, I do not have strong evidence to challenge yet. A higher bid is required. I have three 8s, and 8s have shown up frequently in previous hands, indicating that other players may also have some. Bidding 5 8s is the lowest valid higher bid and leverages my strong hand in 8s, which has already been successful in previous rounds.

Given that there are 24 total digits remaining and 3 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. The bid of 5 8s seems high but possible. However, I do not have enough information to be certain it's a lie. My hand contains 3 8s, and if the other players have 2 8s combined, that would make 5 8s. I should bid higher to test the claim or challenge if I think it's unlikely.
