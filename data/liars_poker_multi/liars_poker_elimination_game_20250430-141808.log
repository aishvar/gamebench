Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an opening bid. Looking at my hand, 83279711, I notice I have two 7s and other digits. Since I have to make a bid that is strictly higher than 'None', I can start with a low quantity and a digit I have in my hand. Bidding on a digit I have increases the likelihood of the bid being valid. Considering the total number of digits and the distribution, starting with a low quantity like 2 or 3 for a digit seems reasonable. I choose to bid on the digit 7 because I have two of them, making it more likely that there are at least three 7s among all players, given the random distribution of digits.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s, and I must bid higher. I have one '8' in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit. Increasing the digit to 9 while keeping quantity at 3 is the smallest valid increase. Since I have no '9's, but the bid is still reasonable, I will bid 3 9s to keep the bid plausible and manageable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. The expected count for any digit is 4.8 (48/10). A bid of 3 9s is below the expected value, making it statistically likely to be true and thus risky to challenge, even though I hold no 9s myself (40 digits remain unknown among other players, with an expected 4 9s among them). The next possible bid requires a quantity of 4, starting with 4 0s. Bidding 4 0s is a minimal increase, is statistically plausible (expected count 4.8), and avoids revealing information about my hand (which contains three 4s and two 7s). While bidding 4 4s based on my hand is an option, the standard, safer play at this early stage is the minimum increase.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 61212296. I have two 1s, three 2s, two 6s, and one 9. The current bid is 4 0s. I have no 0s.  With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits.  A bid of 4 0s is slightly above the average expected count of 4.8 (48 / 10). While possible, it's not a certainty.  However, I have strong counts of 2s and 6s. Bidding 5 2s or 5 6s would be a safe increase, or I could bid 4 of a higher digit. Bidding 4 1s is also an option based on my hand.  Challenging 4 0s is risky given the potential for other players to have 0s.  Bidding 5 2s seems like a reasonable and safe increase based on my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s, and I have one 2 in my hand. While it's possible that others have 2s, bidding higher on 2s seems risky. Instead, I should consider bidding on a digit I have more of or challenging the current bid. I have two 6s and two 8s in my hand. Bidding 6 6s is a reasonable increase in both quantity and digit, making it a valid and strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 6 6s, I must decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Since my hand contains no 6s, I have no direct information to suggest the bid is likely or unlikely based on my own digits. However, considering the total number of digits remaining (48) and the fact that each player has 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any single digit is 48. This means that bidding higher in quantity is risky because the maximum possible quantity for any digit is capped. Given that the current bid is already at 6, which is relatively high considering the distribution of digits could be quite spread out among 6 players, I need to consider if challenging is a safer bet. Without specific knowledge of other players' hands, it's difficult to assess the likelihood of the current bid being true. Since my hand does not contain any 6s and I do not have enough information to confidently make a higher bid, challenging seems like a reasonable strategy, especially considering the current bid's quantity is already at 6, which might be on the higher end given the random distribution of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None' and I have to make a bid that is strictly higher, I should consider the digits in my hand and their potential distribution among other players. My hand contains 83279711, which has two 7s and other digits. Since the game just started and there are no previous bids in this round to react to, I should make a conservative yet potentially winning bid. Considering my hand and the fact that I need to start the bidding, bidding on a digit I have, like the 7, seems reasonable. However, to ensure my bid is competitive and considering the total number of digits remaining (40), I should aim for a quantity that is plausible given the number of players and digits each has. Given that each player has 8 digits and there are 5 players, the maximum number of any single digit is 40 (if all players had the same digit, which is highly unlikely). A bid of 3 on any digit seems like a safe starting point, considering the distribution and my own hand. I have two 7s, so bidding on 7s could be a good strategy, hoping that other players also have some 7s to make my bid valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have two 7s and one 8 in my hand, and considering the total digits remaining is 32, I should make a reasonable bid. Given that 7 appears twice in my hand and it's a relatively high digit, bidding on 7s could be a good strategy. However, I should also consider the bids from the previous rounds to gauge what others might have. Since no one has bid yet in this round, I'll start with a moderate bid, increasing the quantity slightly to account for the potential distribution of digits among other players.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand, which supports the bid but doesn't strongly increase confidence. To make a higher bid, I must increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Bidding 3 8s is the minimal valid increase and still plausible. Since the previous players have been aggressive and the count of 7s is reasonably likely to be at least 3, I will raise the bid conservatively to 3 8s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. With 32 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 3.2. A bid of 3 is statistically very likely, making a challenge risky, even though I hold no 8s. My hand contains three 4s (44234767). Bidding based on my strong suit is a good strategy. Bidding 4 4s is a valid increase from 3 8s (higher quantity). Given I have three 4s, needing only one more 4 among the remaining 24 digits held by the other 3 players is highly probable.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 61212296. I have two 6s, three 2s, one 1, one 9. The current bid is 4 4s. I have zero 4s. With 4 players and 32 total digits, a bid of 4 of any digit is slightly above average expectation (32/10 = 3.2). However, Player 3 made this bid, and I have no information to strongly suggest it's a bluff. I have three 2s, which is a strong holding for that digit. Bidding 5 2s is a valid higher bid and is well supported by my hand. Bidding 5 of any other digit is less supported. Bidding 4 of a higher digit like 4 5s or 4 6s is also valid, but 5 2s is the safest bet based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 2s and my hand of 83279711, I notice I have one 2. Considering the total digits remaining is 32 and there are 4 active players, the maximum number of any digit could be 32 if all players had the same digit in all their slots, which is highly unlikely. Since I only have one 2 and the bid is for 5 2s, I must consider the likelihood of other players having enough 2s to meet or exceed this bid. Given that each player has 8 digits and there are 4 players, it's possible but not guaranteed that there are 5 or more 2s among all players. However, without more information about the other players' hands, I must rely on probability and the information I have. Challenging the bid seems like a reasonable action because if the actual count of 2s is less than 5, I win, and if it's 5 or more, I lose. Given the uncertainty and the potential for other players not to have enough 2s to support the bid of 5 2s, challenging is my best move.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have two 2s in my hand (digits: 54800137), which makes the bid plausible but not very high. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 would be risky without more 2s visible, so I will increase the digit while keeping the quantity at 4. I have a 3 and 4 in my hand, but the next digit after 2 is 3, so bidding 4 3s is a valid and reasonable increase.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand (44234767). For the bid to be true, there need to be at least 3 more 3s across the other two players (16 digits). The expected number of 3s in those 16 digits is 1.6 (16 * 1/10). So, 3 more is plausible, making a challenge risky. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains three 4s. Bidding 4 4s is a minimal increase (same quantity, higher digit) and is highly likely to be true, as it only requires one more 4 among the other 16 digits (where the expected number is 1.6). This is a safe bid that puts pressure on the next player.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s by Player 2. I have one 3 in my hand (44234767). For the bid to be true, the other two players (Player 2 and Player 4) need to have at least four 3s combined in their 16 digits. The expected number of 3s in those 16 digits is 1.6 (16 * 0.1). Five total 3s is significantly above the average of 2.4 total 3s (24 * 0.1), making a challenge seem plausible. However, I have three 4s in my hand. Bidding 5 4s requires only two more 4s among the other 16 digits held by Player 2 and Player 4. The expected number of 4s in those 16 digits is 1.6. Needing just two 4s from the other players is statistically reasonable, especially given my strong holding of three 4s. This bid leverages my hand's strength, is mathematically plausible, and puts pressure on the next player (Player 4). It feels safer and more strategic than challenging the 5 3s bid.

A bid of 5 4s is already above average. While I have three 2s, bidding 5 2s again (which I did earlier in this round) might be too risky if the other players don't have many 2s. Bidding 6 2s is even riskier. I could bid 5 6s since I have two 6s, but that's still a bit high. Given the increasing bids and the fact that I don't have any 4s to support the current bid, challenging 5 4s seems like a reasonable move, especially since the average count for 4s among the other two players would need to be high.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s, made by Player 4. I must make a strictly higher bid. I have one '4' in my hand. The next valid bids must be either a higher quantity than 5 or the same quantity with a higher digit. Bidding 6 0s would be a big jump and risky since I have no zeros. Bidding 5 5s is the smallest possible increase in digit with the same quantity, and I have one '5' in my hand, which slightly supports this bid. Given the total digits are 16, and previous bids around 5 quantity are plausible, bidding 5 5s is a reasonable and safe next move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 61212296. I have three 2s, two 6s, one 1, one 9. The current bid is 5 5s. With only 16 total digits, the expected number of any single digit is around 1.6 (16 / 10). A bid of 5 5s seems quite high, especially since I have no 5s in my hand. It's unlikely there are five 5s between the two players. Challenging seems like the best option.
