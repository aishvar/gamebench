Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. With 48 total digits across 6 players, the average count per digit is approximately 4.8. Bidding 4 0s is a reasonable starting bid based on my hand and statistical expectations, as it's likely the total zeros across all players meet or exceed this quantity.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 5 0s increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages the possibility that other players may hold additional 0s, making the bid plausible.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have the hand 69002472, which contains two 0s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have some information about the count of 0s (I have 2), and there are 5 players other than me, the total count of 0s could be more than 5 if other players also have 0s. However, bidding much higher might be risky. I can bid 6 0s, increasing the quantity, which is a relatively safe move given the information I have.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:3 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, the average count for any digit is around 48 / 10 = 4.8. A bid of 6 0s is slightly above average but not unreasonable, especially considering two players have already bid on 0s. However, I have four 5s in my hand, which is a strong concentration. Bidding on 5s is a good strategy given my hand. Increasing the quantity to 7 5s is a reasonable step up from 6 0s, using my strong hand to support the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:free), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 5s, which is significantly above the expected average of about 4.8 fives across 48 digits. With only one 5 in my hand (17508476), and considering the binomial probability of at least seven 5s being low (approximately 15%), it is unlikely to be true. Bidding higher, such as 7 7s, would also be risky with only two 7s in my hand and a similar low probability. Therefore, challenging is the most strategic move to potentially eliminate Player 3.

Player 3 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round. I have three 5s and two 6s in my hand. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. Bidding 5 5s is a safe starting bid based on my hand and the average distribution.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:4 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 39860159, which contains one 5. The current bid is 5 5s by Player 3. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, an average of 4 fives across all hands would be reasonable (40 digits / 10 possible digits). Since I only have one 5, it's possible that the total count reaches 5, but it feels slightly optimistic given the distribution. However, challenging now might be risky as the bid isn't extremely high. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid to keep the game moving and test the waters. I’ll bid 6 5s, increasing the quantity while staying on the same digit, as I believe it's still plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. With 40 total digits remaining and no 5s in my hand (which contains two 0s), the expected number of 5s across all players is around 4. A bid of 6 is significantly higher than this expectation. Since Player 5 raised the bid from 5 5s to 6 5s, it may be a bluff given the lack of 5s in my own hand. Challenging seems justified as the actual count is likely below 6.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet in this round and I am starting the bidding, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand is 39860159, which contains two 9s, two 5s, and one each of 3, 8, 6, and 0. Bidding on 9s seems like a good choice since I have two of them, and with 32 total digits across 4 players, it's plausible that there are a few more 9s out there. I will bid 4 9s, which is a reasonable starting bid that is not too aggressive but still leverages my hand strength.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s made by Player 1. I have the hand 69002472, which contains two 5s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have some information about my own hand, I see that I have no 9s, one 6, and other digits distributed. Given that the total count of 5s is already 5, and I have 2 of them, it's plausible that the total count is higher than 5. However, increasing the quantity to 6 5s seems reasonable because it is a small increment. Alternatively, bidding 5 6s is also a valid option as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit. I will choose to bid 5 6s because it is a safer increase based on my hand information and the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 35066155. I have three 5s and two 6s. The current bid is 5 6s.  I have two 6s, so the other three players would need to have at least three 6s combined for the bid to be true. This is possible but not guaranteed. Given the history of successful bids, I'm hesitant to challenge a bid of 5 6s when I hold two of them.  I can make a valid higher bid. I have three 5s, and Player 1 just bid 5 5s. I can bid 6 5s, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same as a previous bid. This is a safer bid than increasing the quantity of 6s significantly.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:4 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s by Player 3. In my hand (39860159), I have two 5s. With 4 active players and 32 total digits, each player has 8 digits. If I have 2 5s, there need to be at least 4 more 5s among the other 24 digits for the bid to hold. The probability of this is uncertain but not extremely low, as 5s could be distributed unevenly. Previous rounds show that bids of 6 or 7 5s have been successful, suggesting 5s might be common in this game. I could challenge, but the risk is high since the bid isn't outrageously improbable. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 6 5s, I can bid higher by increasing the quantity or keeping the quantity and increasing the digit. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 6 9s feels safer than increasing the quantity to 7 on a digit I have less of. This bid is a reasonable escalation while leveraging my own hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. My hand contains one 9, and with 32 total digits remaining across four players, it's unlikely that there are six 9s in total. Challenging this bid is reasonable because the probability of the actual count being less than 6 is high, especially given the lack of evidence supporting such a high count.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 5s. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid of 3 5s is reasonable. This increases the quantity beyond my own count, leaving room for others to have additional 5s. It aligns with the pattern of previous bids focusing on digits like 0s and 5s, and provides a plausible target for the next player to challenge or build upon.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 1. I have the hand 69002472, which contains one 5. So, the total count of 5s across all hands is at least 1 (mine) plus whatever Player 1 and Player 3 have. Given that there are 24 total digits and my hand has a diverse distribution, I can infer that bidding 3 6s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit. This is a cautious increase, considering the relatively low quantity bid by Player 1.

Player 1 bid 4 6s, suggesting they might have at least one or two 6s as well. Player 3 previously bid 4 5s, so they might not have many 6s. Considering the total count of 6s, bidding 5 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. I will make a higher bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 35066155, which contains three 5s and two 6s. The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 2. With three players and 24 total digits, the average count for any digit is 2.4. A bid of 5 6s is significantly higher than the average, but I do have two 6s in my hand. It's possible Player 1 or Player 2 has three or more 6s. However, Player 2 just made the bid of 5 6s. If I challenge and the actual count is 5 or more, I lose. If I bid, I need to bid higher than 5 6s. I could bid 6 5s, as I have three 5s, or I could bid 6 6s, which seems risky based on my hand and the previous bid. Given the current bid and my hand, challenging seems like a reasonable option, as 5 6s is a high bid relative to the total digits, especially considering Player 2 just made that bid. However, I have two 6s, meaning the other two players only need three 6s between them for the bid to be true. Bidding 6 5s is a safe increase based on my hand.

Having four 5s is significantly above average.  A bid of 4 5s is plausible, but I know there are at least four 5s.  Bidding 5 5s increases the quantity and is well supported by my hand.
