Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 99193814, which contains two 9s and one 8 and one 3. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and consider the total number of digits. Bidding 5 8s seems reasonable as it reflects a relatively high count based on my hand and is a moderate starting bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. There are 48 total digits (6 players * 8 digits). The expected average count for any digit is 4.8. The bid of 5 is slightly above average. I have zero 8s in my hand (63645997), which slightly decreases the probability of 5 8s existing overall (expected number among others is 40/10 = 4). While challenging is an option, 5 is not an extremely high bid for the first round. A safer move is to make a higher bid based on my hand. I have two 9s. The expected total number of 9s is 4.8; considering my two 9s, the expected total is 2 (mine) + 4 (expected from others) = 6. Bidding 5 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit), is supported by my hand, and is below the statistically expected total of 9s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected number of 9s is around 4.8. A bid of 5 9s is plausible, so challenging is risky. My hand contains two 2s. Bidding 6 2s is a valid higher bid (6 is greater than 5) and is plausible, as it requires 4 additional 2s from the remaining 40 digits among other players, which aligns with the expected count.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. Given that there are 48 digits remaining and 6 players, it's plausible that there could be at least 7 2s. However, bidding higher on 2s is risky. I have a 7 in my hand, so bidding 7 7s is a reasonable move, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. My hand has no 7s. With 48 total digits, the expected number of 7s is 4.8. Bidding 7 7s is statistically unlikely (only ~16% chance of being true). Challenging is a high-probability winning move if the bid is false, which is likely given the expected distribution.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. Bidding 4 2s is a conservative estimate since only one additional 2 is needed across the remaining four players to make the bid valid. This bid is supported by my hand and aligns with the average expected count of 4 for any digit in a 40-digit pool.

Player 5 Reasoning: In my hand, I have zero 2s. The current bid of 4 2s by Player 4 means they must be confident about having multiple 2s in their hand or believe others do. However, with 5 active players having 8 digits each (40 total), and seeing no 2s in my own hand, this bid seems reasonable. I could either make a higher bid or challenge. Since I have three 7s in my hand, I can confidently bid 4 7s, which keeps the same quantity but uses a higher digit. This is a safer move than challenging the current reasonable bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have the hand 99193814, which contains two 7s and one 9. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll make a conservative bid by increasing the digit. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable move as it is a higher bid than 4 7s and I have one 8 in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. There are 5 players and 40 total digits, so the statistical average for any digit is 4. The bid is exactly the average, making it plausible. I have zero 8s in my hand (63645997), which slightly decreases the likelihood of the bid being true, but challenging an average bid is risky. A higher bid must be 4 9s or 5 of any digit. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is supported by my hand. It is also exactly the statistical average (4), making it a reasonably safe bid to make, passing the decision to the next player. Bidding 5 of something (like 5 6s or 5 9s, based on my hand) would be statistically riskier than bidding 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. The expected number of any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. The current bid is exactly the expected value, making it a plausible bid from Player 1. Challenging an expected value bid is risky, as Player 1 might have one or two 9s and is bidding based on probability. My hand is 13628209, containing two 2s and one of each other digit (0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9). To make a higher bid, I must increase the quantity to at least 5. Bidding 5 of a digit I have multiple of is the most strategic approach. I have two 2s. Bidding 5 2s requires 3 more 2s from the remaining 32 digits held by the other 4 players. The expected number of 2s among 32 digits is 3.2, so needing 3 more is quite plausible. Bidding 5 2s is a valid higher bid (quantity 5 > quantity 4) and is the most supported by my hand compared to bidding 5 of any other digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have two 2s in my hand, so three more 2s are needed across the other four players. The expected number of 2s in 40 digits is 4 (40/10), so a bid of 5 is slightly above average. Given the low probability of exceeding the expected value and the risk of a bluff, challenging the bid is the optimal move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: In my hand of 44797715, I have zero 2s. The current bid claims there are at least 4 twos among all players. With 32 total digits remaining (8 per player × 4 players), and knowing I have none, this means the other three players would need to have at least 4 twos between them. While possible, given the previous round where a bid of 5 twos was proven false (when there were more digits in play), it seems unlikely that Player 4 would have accurate information about 4 twos existing. I should challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (44797715), I have: 2x4s, 2x7s, 1x9, 1x5, 1x1. Since I'm starting the round and I know I have two 7s in my hand, bidding 3 7s seems like a reasonable opening move. It's conservative enough to be likely true (needing only one more 7 from the other 16 digits in play), but high enough to be a meaningful opening bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. My hand is 99193814, which contains one 7. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have one 7 and there are two other players, it's possible they have 7s as well. I see that I have two 9s, and the previous bid was 3 7s. Bidding 3 9s seems reasonable as it increases the digit. Alternatively, bidding 4 7s is also a possibility as it increases the quantity. Given that I have a 9 and it's a higher digit than 7, I will bid 3 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 0. I have two 9s in my hand (63645997). With 24 total digits across 3 players, the expected number of any digit is 2.4. For the bid of 3 9s to be true, only one more 9 is needed among the other 16 digits held by Player 0 and Player 5. This is statistically quite likely (approx. 81.5% chance of at least one more 9). Therefore, challenging is too risky. I must make a higher bid. The only option is to increase the quantity to 4. Since I hold two 9s, and Player 0 just bid 3 9s (suggesting they might hold at least one 9), bidding 4 9s is a strong possibility. It builds on my hand and directly increases the pressure on the digit Player 0 bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (44797715), I don't have any 9s. The current bid of 4 9s means there need to be 4 nines across all players' hands (24 total digits). Given that I don't have any 9s, this means the other two players would need to have at least 4 nines between them out of their 16 digits. While not impossible, this seems unlikely. Additionally, Player 1 increased Player 0's bid from 3 9s to 4 9s, which suggests they might be bluffing. The risk/reward ratio favors challenging here.

Player 1 Reasoning: I am Player 1 and need to make the opening bid. My hand is 63645997, containing two 6s and two 9s. There are 16 total digits between me and Player 0. The expected count for any digit is 1.6. In the previous round (with 3 players), Player 0 bid 3 9s, and I raised to 4 9s. The challenge revealed a total of six 9s. Since I have two 9s now, it's probable Player 0 still holds several 9s from the previous round. Bidding 3 9s is a strong opening, supported by my hand and the game history, assuming Player 0 has at least one 9, which is highly likely.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have two 9s in my hand (99193814), so I know there are at least 2 nines. Considering there are 16 digits in total and Player 1 also has 8 digits, it's possible they have at least one 9. Thus, the total count of 9s could be 3 or more. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since the digit 9 is the highest, I must increase the quantity. Therefore, bidding 4 9s is a valid and reasonable next step.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 63645997, containing two 9s. The current bid is 4 9s by Player 0. This bid was made immediately after I bid 3 9s. Player 0 raising the quantity on the same digit suggests they likely hold at least two 9s to make their bid of 4 9s plausible (requiring 2 from me + 2 from them = 4 total). If Player 0 has exactly two 9s, the total count is 4, and challenging their bid would lose. Therefore, challenging seems too risky. The next possible bid is 5 0s. Bidding on a different digit like 5 6s (I have two 6s) would require Player 0 to have three 6s, which seems statistically unlikely without prior bidding information. Bidding 5 9s builds on the previous bids. It requires Player 0 to hold at least three 9s for the bid to be true (2 from me + 3 from them = 5 total). While risky, it directly confronts Player 0's likely holding of 9s. If Player 0 only has two 9s, they are likely to challenge 5 9s and win. However, if they have three or more, my bid is safe for now, and it puts the pressure back on them. Given their aggressive raise to 4 9s, escalating to 5 9s is the most strategically consistent move.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have two 9s in my hand (99193814), so I know that there are at least two 9s. With 16 total digits remaining and two players, it's possible that the total count of 9s is around or more than 5, given that Player 1 also bid on 9s twice. However, bidding higher than 5 9s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. The next higher bid could be 5 0s (same quantity, higher digit) or 6 0s (higher quantity). Since I have no information about 0s in my hand or Player 1's hand, and considering that the quantity of 9s might not be very high, I should assess the likelihood. Given that I have two 9s, it's plausible that the total count is around 5. I will challenge the bid as it seems a bit high but not extremely unlikely. However, considering the risk and my hand, I should either bid higher or challenge. Bidding 6 0s or 5 0s seems reasonable as it changes the digit.

The current bid of 5 9s is plausible since it's less than half of the total digits. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand (63645997). The current bid is 6 9s made by Player 0. For this bid to be true, Player 0 must hold at least four 9s in their 8-digit hand (since 2 + 4 = 6). Player 0 previously bid 4 9s and then raised to 6 9s after my bid of 5 9s, suggesting confidence and likely holding multiple 9s. However, needing exactly 4 out of 8 digits to be 9s is a very high concentration. Bidding higher would require claiming 7 of a digit, which is statistically improbable with only 16 total digits in play (7/16 = 43.75%). Challenging seems more prudent than making a risky bid of 7. I suspect Player 0 might be bluffing or has exactly 3 nines, making the total 5, not 6.
