Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8. The bid of 3 0s is below average and likely true, so challenging is risky. I need to make a higher bid. I have two 2s in my hand. Bidding 4 2s is a valid higher bid (increasing the quantity to 4) and is plausible given the average expected count of 4.8 for any digit and my holding of two 2s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand. Player 0 previously bid 3 0s, indicating they also hold some 0s. Bidding 5 0s seems reasonable as the total count across all players is likely to meet or exceed this quantity, while also constituting a valid higher bid than the current 4 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 99089765, which contains two 9s and no 0s. The current bid is 5 0s by Player 2. Since I have no 0s, I need to assess if 5 0s is likely across all 48 digits. With 6 players and 8 digits each, the average occurrence of any digit is about 4.8, so 5 0s is slightly above average but plausible. However, I can make a higher bid to test the waters. I have two 9s, so bidding 5 9s keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, which is a valid higher bid. This is a reasonable move given my strong count of 9s, and it avoids an immediate challenge on a bid that might be close to accurate.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s, and I need to bid higher. My hand contains one 9, which makes the total count of 9s unlikely to reach more than 5. Bidding 6 9s would be risky since I only have one 9 and it would require all other players to have at least one 9 each, which is improbable. Alternatively, I can increase the digit to 0 or 1 with a quantity of 6 or more, but my hand does not contain enough 0s or 1s to confidently support such a bid. The safest move is to challenge, as the current bid of 5 9s is quite high and unlikely to be true given the total of 48 digits and the distribution of my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet in this round and I am starting the bidding, I need to make a conservative opening bid. My hand is 99089765, which contains two 9s. Given that there are 5 players with 8 digits each, totaling 40 digits, I can estimate that each digit might appear around 4 times on average. Bidding 3 9s seems reasonable as an opening bid, as I already have 2 in my hand, and it's likely there is at least one more 9 among the other players' hands. This bid is also safe and allows room for others to bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, so the bid of 3 9s could be plausible. However, bidding 4 8s is safer because I hold an 8 (digit 5 in my hand), increasing the likelihood of the bid being true. Raising the quantity to 4 with a digit I possess (8) balances risk and probability better than challenging the existing bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. I could bid 5 8s, or I could bid a higher quantity of a different digit. Bidding 5 0s is also a valid option and doesn't rely on my 8s. I'll bid 5 0s, as that's a safe increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. With 40 total digits, the expected count for any digit is 4. A bid of 5 is slightly above average but not excessively high, suggesting Player 0 might have some support for 0s. Challenging has a probability of success around 58% based on pure chance, but is risky if Player 0 has multiple 0s. I have two 2s in my hand. Bidding 5 2s is a valid increase over 5 0s and is a plausible bid given my hand, allowing me to pass the turn safely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 2s in my hand. The expected number of 2s in the remaining 32 digits (from other players) is 3.2, with a ~79.3% probability that the total count is less than 5. Given the high likelihood of the bid being false, challenging is statistically favorable.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand. As the starting bidder in a 4-player round, bidding 4 0s is a reasonable opening bid based on my holdings and the likelihood that other players may have 0s given previous bidding patterns.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:5 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 99089765, which contains two 9s and no 0s. The current bid is 4 0s by Player 2. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 4 0s is plausible, as it represents only 12.5% of the total digits. Since I have no 0s, I cannot gauge the likelihood directly, but statistically, it's not an extreme bid. Bidding higher, I can leverage my two 9s. A bid of 5 9s seems reasonable, as I already contribute two to the count, and it's likely there are a few more among the other 24 digits. This bid increases both quantity and digit from the current 4 0s, making it a valid higher bid. I prefer not to challenge at this stage since 4 0s is not an unlikely bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 5 9s. To meet this, there must be at least 4 additional 9s in the remaining 24 digits of other players. While possible, the expected number of 9s in 32 digits is 3.2, making 5 a stretch. However, challenging risks elimination if the count is 5 or more. Bidding 6 9s increases the required count further, forcing others to either bid higher (unlikely) or challenge. This strategic push could pressure opponents into a mistake.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. To make a valid bid, I need to bid higher than 6 9s. I can bid 7 of any digit or 6 of a digit higher than 9, which is impossible. Therefore, I must bid 7 of any digit. I will bid 7 0s, as I have two 0s in my hand, making this slightly more plausible than bidding 7 of another digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand, and the current bid is 7 0s. This means the other three players need to collectively hold at least four 0s for the bid to be valid. Given that Player 0 initiated the bid and previous rounds showed aggressive bidding on 0s, it's plausible the total count meets or exceeds 7. However, with limited visibility into other hands and the risk of elimination, challenging feels risky. Instead, shifting focus to another digit where my hand has moderate strength (two 1s) seems strategic. Bidding 7 1s maintains pressure while leveraging my holdings.

Player 2 bids: 7 1s

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:5 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s made by Player 2. In my hand, I have no 1s, which means I contribute nothing to this count. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 7 1s suggests that the other 3 players would need to have an average of about 2.33 1s each, which is possible but not extremely likely given the random distribution of digits. However, challenging carries a risk, and since the bid isn't outrageously high (like 10 or more), it's safer to make a higher bid. I have two 9s in my hand, and there have been previous bids on 9s (up to 6 9s), suggesting there might be some 9s out there. I will bid 8 1s to increase the quantity slightly and test the waters, as it's a modest increase and keeps the pressure on others.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s. With 32 total digits and 1/10 probability for each digit being a 1, the expected count is only 3.2. My hand contains 1 one, so even if all other players had maximum 1s, it's unlikely to reach 8. Challenging this high bid offers a strong chance to eliminate Player 3 if the count is insufficient.

Player 5 Reasoning: As the first to bid, I need to make a safe and plausible bid. My hand contains one '1', and with two other players, it's likely there's at least one more '1' in their hands. Bidding 2 1s is a conservative start, ensuring a high probability of the bid being true while allowing room for escalation.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand, which already meets the current bid of 3 0s. Challenging would be a mistake since the bid is valid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. I have two 1s in my hand, making 3 1s a plausible bid across all players. This bid leverages my knowledge of my own 1s and shifts focus to a higher digit than 0.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. The total digits remaining are 24, with two other players each having 8 digits. The probability of at least two more 1s in their hands is plausible, but challenging carries risk. Bidding 4 1s increases the quantity while leveraging my known 1, making it a cautious yet strategic escalation.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. I can bid 4 2s, which is a valid higher bid. Alternatively, I could bid a higher quantity of any digit. Given I have three 0s, bidding 5 0s seems reasonable.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand. The current bid of 5 0s requires at least two more 0s in the remaining 16 digits across two players. Based on probability, the expected number of 0s in those 16 digits is ~1.6, making the total 0s likely around 4.6. Since the bid requires 5, which exceeds this expectation, challenging has a slight edge (~51.5% chance of success). Given the risk-reward balance, challenging is the optimal move.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s made by Player 0. I have 0 zeros in my hand, so the total number of zeros depends entirely on Player 0. Bidding higher (e.g., 4 0s) would require Player 0 to have at least 4 zeros, which is uncertain. Challenging the bid directly tests whether Player 0 has at least 3 zeros. If they don't, I win. Given the lack of zeros in my hand and the relatively low bid, challenging is a calculated risk with a reasonable chance of success.
