Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid of the round and there is no current bid to beat, I can start with a conservative bid based on the digits in my hand. I have two 6s, so bidding 3 6s is a reasonable starting point, assuming at least one other player has a 6.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected number of any digit is around 4.8 (48 / 10). A bid of 3 6s is slightly below this expectation, but Player 0 might have multiple 6s. I also have two 1s and one 3, 7, 8, 0, and 9.  Bidding 4 1s or 4 of any other digit I have seems reasonable as it's a higher quantity and within the realm of possibility. Bidding 4 1s is the most conservative higher quantity bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have no 1s in my hand, but I have one 2. Bidding 4 2s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 2 and assumes there are three more 2s in other players' hands, making the total at least four. Challenging the current bid of 4 1s is risky since the expected number of 1s is close to 4.8, making 4 plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 4 2s, which means there would need to be at least three more 2s among the other five players. Given that the probability of this is moderate, I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Since I have a 5 in my hand and no higher bids have been made on 5s, I can safely increase the digit to 5 with the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have three 6s in my hand, and bidding 4 6s would be a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit). This leverages my existing 6s while escalating the bid appropriately.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 48375724, which contains no 6s. The current bid is 4 6s. With 48 digits in play, on average there should be about 4.8 of any digit, so 4 6s is plausible. Since I have zero 6s, it is possible that the other five players collectively have at least 4, but it's not guaranteed. However, since the bid is not outrageous and I am early in the round, it is safer to make a minimal higher bid to avoid risking elimination on a marginal challenge. I have two 4s in my hand, so I will bid 4 7s, which is a minimal valid raise based on my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have two 8s in my hand, which is a higher digit than 7. Bidding 4 8s seems like a reasonable move to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8. While 4 8s is a plausible bid, I have a 9 in my hand and can make a slightly higher bid that is still reasonable. Bidding 4 9s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 4 9s, which is likely valid given the expected distribution of digits. Bidding 5 9s increases the quantity while maintaining the same digit, which is plausible given the average of 4.8 9s expected across all hands. This bid is cautious but leverages my existing 9s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 5 9s, which means there would need to be at least four more 9s among the other five players' hands. Given the previous bids and the likelihood of 9s, this seems high but not impossible. To keep the game going, I can bid 5 0s, which is a higher bid by digit but maintains the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 5 9s, which is quite high given that there are only 48 digits in total and 6 players. The probability that there are at least 5 nines across all hands is low, especially since the bidding has escalated quickly. Challenging seems like the best move.

Player 2 Reasoning: As the starting bidder, I need to make a reasonable first bid. My hand contains two 9s, making 3 9s a plausible bid considering the remaining players' hands. This bid is conservative yet leverages my own digits, increasing the likelihood of the bid being true.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains three 6s. The current bid is 3 9s. Bidding 4 6s increases the quantity (from 3 to 4) while leveraging my own hand's 6s, making it a valid and strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have the hand 48375724, which contains one 6. The current bid is 4 6s, meaning that across all 40 digits, there must be at least four 6s. With only one 6 in my hand, and with five players, it's plausible that there are at least three more among the other 32 digits. Statistically, each digit appears about 4 times (40 digits / 10 possible digits), so 4 6s is a reasonable bid. There is not enough evidence to confidently challenge. To stay in the game, I will make a higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, so I will bid 4 7s, raising the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have two 6s in my hand. Given that there are 40 digits remaining and it's unlikely that there are 5 or more 8s or 9s remaining, I should increase the digit but keep the quantity the same. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable move, as it's higher than the current bid and leverages the information from the previous round where there were exactly 5 9s.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:3 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 37186019. I have one 8. The current bid is 4 8s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, the average count for any digit is 40/10 = 4.  A bid of 4 8s is right at the average. Given I only have one 8, it seems unlikely there are three more 8s among the other four players. The previous round saw a successful challenge on a bid of 5 9s when there were 6 players and 48 digits, which was a higher bid relative to the total digits. Challenging 4 8s seems reasonable given my hand and the current game state.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None'. I have two 6s in my hand. Since no bids have been made yet, I can start with a conservative bid. Bidding 3 6s is a safe starting point since I have two 6s and it's a reasonable assumption that others might have at least one 6.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s. Bidding 3 9s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity as the current bid (3 6s). Since I have two 9s, only one more 9 is needed in the remaining 24 digits of other players to make the bid valid. This is more likely than requiring three 6s given the expected distribution of digits, making it a safer and higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. In my hand (48375724), I have no 6s. With 4 players and 8 digits each, the probability of 4 or more 6s is moderate, but I cannot directly support the bid. However, since I must either raise the bid or challenge, and the bid is not outrageously high, it is safer to make a minimal higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, so raising to 4 7s is reasonable and keeps the pressure on others.

Player 0 Reasoning: Player 5 bid 4 7s. I have two 6s in my hand, and I previously bid 3 6s. I know that Player 4 also has at least one 6. It is likely that there are at least 5 6s in play, so I will bid 5 6s. If this bid is challenged, I am confident that I will win. I could also challenge 4 7s, but I am confident that there are at least 4 7s in play, so I will bid instead.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand, so the remaining three players must have at least four 6s for the bid to be true. Given the total digits (32) and average distribution (3.2 per digit), 5 6s is above the expected count (3.4 with my 1). The bid is statistically unlikely, making a challenge favorable.
