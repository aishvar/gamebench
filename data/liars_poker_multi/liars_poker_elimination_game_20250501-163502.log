Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 zero. I have no zeros in my hand (29465465). Since the bid is very low, I can safely increase the bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 2 sixes is a reasonable and safe increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand (19986681). The current bid is '2 6s' made by Player 1. Since I already have two 6s myself, I know there are at least 2 sixes in the game. This makes the current bid very safe. I could challenge, but I would lose since the actual count is at least 2. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s and two 1s as well. I could bid '3 6s', but that's risky since I only know about my two 6s. I could bid '2 7s' (increasing the digit), but I don't have any 7s in my hand. I could bid '2 8s' (increasing the digit further), which is safe because I have two 8s myself. I could also bid '3 1s' (increasing the quantity) since I have two 1s, but that requires one more 1 among other players. I'll go with '2 8s' as it's the safest option based on my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 63910650. I have two 6s, two 0s, one 3, one 9, one 1, and one 5. The current bid is 2 8s. I need to make a higher bid. I have no 8s in my hand, so increasing the quantity of 8s feels risky. I have two 6s, and the previous bid was 2 6s. Bidding 3 6s is a valid higher bid and is supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand (49353737). Challenging this low bid seems risky, as the expected number of any digit across 48 total digits is 4.8, making 3 a plausible quantity. I need to make a higher bid. Options include 3 7s, 3 8s, 3 9s, or increasing the quantity to 4 (e.g., 4 0s). I have two 7s and three 3s. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Given my two 7s, it's highly probable there's at least one more 7 among the remaining 40 digits held by other players. This is a safe, incremental increase over the current bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s, and I have two 7s in my hand. Since the previous bid was 3 6s, it's likely that there are at least 3 7s among all players. Bidding 4 7s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity while keeping the same digit. Challenging does not seem wise, as it is likely the bid is truthful.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. I have one '6' and two '4's in my hand. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can bid 1 1s or increase the quantity. Given that '1 1s' is higher than '1 0s' and likely to be true since digits 1 are common, it's a safe and valid bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (19986681), I have one 1 and two 8s, two 6s, and one 9. The current bid is very low at '1 1s', which means I need to either bid higher or challenge. Since I have one 1 in my hand, I know there's at least one 1 among all players, so the current bid is definitely valid and challenging would be a mistake. I should make a higher bid. I could bid on 8s since I have two of them, or 6s since I have two of those as well. I'll go with '2 1s' since it's a safe increment from the current bid, and there's a good chance there are at least two 1s total among all five players (I already have one).

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 63910650. I have one 1. The current bid is 2 1s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits.  On average, we'd expect 4 of each digit (40/10). The current bid of 2 1s is below this average, and I have one 1 myself.  It's plausible there are at least two 1s among the 5 players. I can bid higher. I have two 6s and one 0. Bidding 3 0s or 3 6s are valid options. Bidding 3 0s seems slightly safer as I have one 0 and the average is 4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. The expected number of any digit is 4. I have zero 0s in my hand (49353737). While 3 0s is below the average, it only requires 3 zeros among the other 32 hidden digits, which is plausible. Challenging seems risky for such a low bid. My hand contains three 3s. Bidding 4 3s is a valid higher bid (increasing the quantity). Since I hold three 3s, this bid only requires one additional 3 among the remaining 32 digits held by other players, which is statistically very likely. This is a strong bid based on my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I am Player 4 and it's my turn to start the bidding. The current bid is 'None', so I must make a bid. My hand is 49353737. I have three 3s, two 7s, one 4, one 9, and one 5. There are 4 players and 32 total digits. The expected number of any digit is 3.2. My strongest holding is three 3s, which is close to the expected average. An opening bid should generally be conservative but based on one's hand. Bidding '3 3s' accurately reflects the number of 3s I hold. This is a safe opening bid, unlikely to be immediately challenged, and sets a reasonable baseline for the round.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one '3' in my hand, so the bid is plausible but not overly strong. To raise the bid, I need to increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. I have two '6's and two '5's in my hand, so bidding 3 5s or 3 6s is possible. However, bidding 3 5s is lower than 3 6s, so I should bid 3 5s or higher. Since 3 5s is higher than 3 3s, I will bid 3 5s to keep the bid reasonable and not overcommit.

Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (19986681), I have two 6s and two 8s, but no 5s. Player 1 has bid 3 5s, which means they believe there are at least 3 fives among all 32 digits in play. Since I don't have any 5s in my hand, all 3 would need to come from the other 3 players' hands (24 digits total). This is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's a reasonable bid. Instead, I'll make a higher bid based on what I know. I have two 6s in my hand, so there are at least 2 sixes. I'll bid 3 6s, which is higher than 3 5s because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity. This is a safe bid since I only need one more 6 among the other 24 digits to make this true.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. With 32 total digits across 4 players, the average count for any digit is 3.2. A bid of 3 6s is plausible. To make a higher bid, I need to bid at least 4 of any digit or 3 of a digit higher than 6. I have two 6s, one 9, one 1, one 0, one 5, and another 0. I have two 0s, one 1, one 5, two 6s, one 9, and one 3. Bidding 4 of any digit seems risky based on my hand. Bidding 3 of a higher digit is possible with my 9. I have one 9, so bidding 3 9s is a possibility, assuming other players have at least two 9s. Given the previous bids and my hand, challenging 3 6s is a possibility if I suspect Player 2 is bluffing. However, with two 6s in my hand, it's more likely there are at least three 6s in total. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable next step, as it's a valid higher bid and I have one 9.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s by Player 3. I have one 9 in my hand (49353737). This means only two more 9s are needed among the other 24 hidden digits for the bid to be true. The expected number of 9s across all 32 digits is 3.2, so 3 9s is a plausible bid, making a challenge risky. I need to make a higher bid, which means bidding at least quantity 4. Looking at my hand, I have three 3s. Bidding 4 3s requires only one more 3 among the other 24 digits. Statistically, with an expected 3.2 total 3s, and me holding three, it is highly probable that there is at least one more 3. This is a much safer option than challenging or bidding on a digit where I hold fewer cards. I previously bid 3 3s this round, so escalating to 4 3s is a consistent and strong move based on my hand.

Since I have one '3' in my hand and no '9's, the previous bids of 3 9s and 4 3s seem plausible. I can raise the bid to 4 4s, which is a higher digit at the same quantity.

Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (19986681), I have zero 4s. The current bid is '4 4s' made by Player 1. With 32 total digits in play and 8 in my hand (none of which are 4s), there are 24 digits in other players' hands. For the bid to be valid, there need to be at least 4 fours among those 24 digits. This is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's a risky move since the probability of finding 4 or more fours in 24 random digits is reasonable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 6s and two 8s in my hand, which gives me confidence. I'll bid '4 6s' to increase the digit while keeping the same quantity, which is a safer move than challenging at this point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s. With 4 players and 32 total digits, the expected number of any specific digit is around 3.2 (32 / 10). A bid of 4 6s is slightly above average expectation but not impossible. I have two 6s, meaning the other 3 players would need to have at least two more 6s combined. Given the previous bids, particularly the jump to 4s, players might be bidding aggressively. I could challenge, but with two 6s myself, there's a reasonable chance the bid is accurate or close. Bidding higher is also an option. I could bid 5 of any digit, but that feels like a significant jump. Bidding 4 of a higher digit is the other option. I have a 9, so bidding 4 9s is a possibility, but Player 3 (me) already bid 3 9s earlier in this round. Bidding 4 9s would confirm I have at least one 9, which might not be strategically ideal. Bidding 4 7s or 4 8s are possibilities, but I have no 7s or 8s. Given my hand and the current bid, challenging seems risky with my two 6s. Bidding 5 0s is a safe increase in quantity and a low digit. I have two 0s, so this bid is somewhat supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. There are 32 total digits among 4 players. The expected number of any digit is 3.2 (32/10). A bid of 5 is significantly above average. Crucially, my hand (49353737) contains zero 0s. This means the other 3 players must hold at least five 0s among their combined 24 digits. The expected number of 0s among those 24 digits is only 2.4 (24/10). Player 3 previously bid 3 9s and now jumped to 5 0s, suggesting it might be a bluff or an attempt to shift away from a contested digit. Given I have no 0s, the probability of there being 5 or more 0s among the remaining 24 digits seems low. Therefore, challenging is the statistically better move.

Player 4 Reasoning: I am Player 4 and it's my turn to start the bidding in this round with 3 players and 24 total digits. My hand is 49353737, containing three 3s, two 7s, one 4, one 5, and one 9. The highest count of any digit in my hand is three 3s. The expected average count for any digit across all 24 digits is 2.4. Since I hold three 3s myself, bidding '3 3s' is a strong and truthful opening bid. It's plausible that there are at least three 3s in total, and this bid leverages the strongest part of my hand. It sets a reasonable starting point for the bidding.

With 3 players total having 8 digits each, there are 24 total digits in play. For there to be at least 3 4s, Player 1 and Player 4 would need to have at least 3 4s between them. This is certainly possible. I could bid 3 5s, which is higher than 3 4s, but I don't have any 5s in my hand. I could bid 3 6s, which I'm more confident in since I have 2 6s myself. Another option is to bid 3 8s since I have 2 8s. I think bidding 3 6s is reasonable given my hand composition.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand (49353737). For the bid to be true, the other two players must have at least three 6s between their 16 cards. This is plausible, so challenging is risky. I need to make a higher bid. Options include 3 7s, 3 8s, 3 9s, or starting with quantity 4. I have two 7s, making 3 7s a very safe bid (only need one more 7 among 16 cards). However, I have three 3s. Bidding 4 3s requires only one more 3 among the other 16 cards, which is statistically likely (expected 1.6 3s in those cards). This bid leverages my strong hand in 3s and increases the quantity, putting more pressure on the next player compared to the safer, lower bid of 3 7s. Therefore, bidding 4 3s is the stronger strategic move.

Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 4 6s is reasonable - same quantity but higher digit. This is a safer play than challenging at this point.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 2. There are 24 total digits among the 3 players. My hand (49353737) contains zero 6s. For the bid to be true, the other two players (Player 1 and Player 2) must hold at least four 6s among their combined 16 digits. The expected number of 6s in those 16 digits is 1.6 (16 * 1/10). Requiring 4 sixes is significantly above the statistical expectation. While I could make a plausible higher bid like 5 3s (since I have three 3s), challenging seems more advantageous given I have none of the bid digit, making it less likely the total count is met. Winning a challenge also eliminates an opponent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I'm starting a new round with just Player 1 and myself remaining. Looking at my hand (19986681), I have: two 1s, one 9, two 8s, two 6s, and one 0. Since I'm starting the bidding, I want to make a conservative yet strategic bid. I have two 6s in my hand, which means there could be more 6s in Player 1's hand. Starting with a bid of 2 6s would be safe since I know I have exactly that many. However, I could also bid on 1s (I have two) or 8s (I have two). Since 6s are a relatively high digit, I'll go with 2 6s as my opening bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand (positions 2 and 7). The current bid is 2 6s by Player 2. Bidding 3 6s is a valid higher bid and reasonable since I hold two 6s myself, making the total of at least three 6s plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand (19986681). The current bid by Player 1 is 3 6s, which means they're claiming there are at least 3 sixes total between both our hands. Since I have 2 sixes, Player 1 would need to have at least 1 six for their bid to be valid. This is quite possible. I could challenge, but it's risky since Player 1 only needs to have 1 six for me to lose. Alternatively, I could raise the bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, so I could bid '3 8s', which is higher than '3 6s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity. This seems like a safer move than challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s, which means there are at least three 8s in total. I have no 8s in my hand (my hand is 2,9,4,6,5,4,6,5). Given that there are only 16 digits in total and I hold none, it is possible but somewhat risky to assume there are three 8s. The minimum next bid must be higher than 3 8s. I have two 6s and two 5s, but 5s and 6s are lower digits than 8, so I cannot bid the same quantity with a higher digit. I must either bid 4 0s or higher or challenge. Bidding 4 0s is a safe move because 0s are common and I have no 0s, but it is a minimal increase. However, challenging now might be premature since 3 8s is plausible. Therefore, I will bid 4 0s, increasing the quantity and digit to a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (19986681), I have zero 0s. Player 1 has bid 4 0s, meaning they're claiming there are at least 4 zeros between both our hands. Since I have none, all 4 would need to be in Player 1's hand. While possible, it seems somewhat unlikely that Player 1 would have exactly 4 zeros out of their 8 digits. In previous rounds, Player 1 has shown a pattern of making aggressive bids. Given that I have no 0s and the maximum possible is 8 (if all of Player 1's digits were 0s), the bid of 4 0s seems suspicious. I could bid 4 1s, but I only have one 1 in my hand, making this risky. I could also bid 4 6s, 4 8s, or 5 something else, but challenging seems like the better option here since I believe the current bid is likely an overestimate.
