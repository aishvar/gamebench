Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the round. I have two 9s, one 6, one 5, one 4, one 3, and two 0s in my hand. A conservative but reasonable first bid would be 2 9s. This is a safe starting point without revealing too much about my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 4.8. A bid of 2 9s is extremely low and highly likely to be true, making a challenge very risky. I need to make a higher bid. The lowest possible higher bid is 3 0s. My hand is 42630427. I have zero 9s, but I have two 2s and two 4s. Bidding based on my hand strength is a good strategy. Bidding 3 2s is a safe increment over 2 9s, is statistically likely (expected number of 2s is 4.8), and is supported by the two 2s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. In my hand I hold two 4s, meaning I already contribute half of a bid of 4 4s myself. With 40 unknown digits among the other five players, the expected number of 4s in those hands is about 4, so the chance that at least two more 4s exist is very high. Raising the quantity from 3 to 4 makes the bid strictly higher while still remaining well-supported by probability and my cards.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have zero 4s in my hand, so challenging this bid is risky as 4 4s is close to the average expected count among the other 5 players. I have three 5s in my hand, which is a strong count. Bidding '5 5s' is a valid higher bid (higher quantity and higher digit than 4 4s). With 5 other players holding 40 digits, the average count of 5s among them is 4. My three 5s plus an expected 2+ from others makes '5 5s' a reasonable and confident bid based on my hand strength.

Player 3 Reasoning: It is the start of a new round and I am the first bidder. The current bid is 'None', so I must make a valid bid. My hand contains three 5s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. Bidding '4 5s' is a reasonable starting bid, based on my strongest digit count (three 5s) and close to the expected average total count for a digit. It's a valid bid as the first action.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have two 5s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable next step, as 6s are less common but still plausible, and it is strictly higher than 4 5s. Increasing the quantity to 5 would be riskier without more 5s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand. Player 3 bid 4 5s and Player 5 increased to 4 6s. Given I have no 6s, challenging seems like a reasonable option. However, I also have two 9s, so bidding 5 9s is a valid option. Considering the previous challenge failed, and the number of players is relatively small, a challenge seems more strategic. If the bid is valid, I lose, but if it's a bluff, I eliminate a player.

Player 5 Reasoning: There are no current bids in this round, and I have two 5s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 2 5s is a reasonable opening move, as it is a modest claim and leverages the digits I hold.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s, which is very low for 32 total digits (expected count is 3.2). Challenging this bid is extremely risky. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 42630427, containing two 2s and two 4s. Bidding 3 2s is a valid increase (higher quantity) and is supported by my hand, making it a statistically reasonable and relatively safe bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 7s. To satisfy a bid of 3 7s, only one more 7 is needed among the remaining 24 unseen digits, which is highly probable (well over 90% by random distribution). This bid is strictly higher than 3 2s because the digit is higher while the quantity remains the same, and it avoids the risk of challenging a plausible bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. My hand is 55735203. I have three 5s in my hand. With 32 total digits remaining, the expected count for any digit is 3.2. Bidding 4 5s is a valid higher bid than 3 7s (higher quantity). Since I hold three 5s, I only need one more 5 among the other 24 digits, which is very likely (expected 2.4). Challenging 3 7s, given I have one 7 and the expected count of 7s in the other 24 digits is 2.4, seems riskier than making a well-supported bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have two 5s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 0s seems risky without any zeros in my hand. Instead, bidding 4 6s is a valid and reasonable increase since I have one 6 in my hand, and it is just one digit higher than 5. This bid is both valid and based on my hand, making it a safe move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (42630427). For the bid to be true, the other 3 players need at least three 6s among their 24 digits. The expected number of 6s among those 24 digits is 2.4 (24 * 0.1), so needing 3 is plausible, making a challenge risky, especially since Player 5 won on exactly 4 6s last round. I should make a higher bid. I have two 2s and previously bid 3 2s. Bidding 5 2s is a logical next step, leveraging my strong hand in 2s and my previous bid history. It requires 3 additional 2s from the other 24 digits, which is plausible (expected value 2.4). This bid is stronger than bidding on a digit I have fewer of or relying solely on another player's previous bid.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:1 - o3-2025-04-16) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I see only one 2 in my own hand. That means at least four more 2s would have to be spread among the 24 unknown digits (held by Players 1, 3, and 5) to make the bid of 5 2s true. With a uniform 10% chance for any digit, the probability of getting at least four 2s in 24 trials is roughly 21%. That is far below 50%, so the current bid is statistically unlikely to be correct. Challenging now gives me about a 79% chance to eliminate Player 1, which is better than making a riskier higher bid that could easily be challenged by Player 3. Therefore, I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I begin the round and must place the first bid. I hold two 4s (4,4) in my eight-digit hand. Out of the 16 unseen digits (held by Players 3 and 5), the expected number of 4s is about 1.6, making the chance that at least one more 4 is present roughly 80%. Thus the probability there are at least three 4s total is high, giving me a solid, defensible opening. A bid of 3 4s is modest—it’s likely true, yet not so high that it invites an immediate challenge—and it leaves plenty of room for future raises.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 55735203, containing three 5s. The current bid is 3 4s. There are 3 players remaining with a total of 24 digits. The expected count for any digit is 2.4 (24/10). My three 5s already exceed this. Bidding 4 5s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity than 3). This requires at least one more 5 among the remaining 16 digits held by other players. The expected number of 5s in the other 16 digits is 1.6 (16 * 2.4/10, roughly). Thus, the total expected count of 5s is 3 (mine) + 1.6 (others) = 4.6. Bidding 4 5s is below this expected value, making it a highly probable bid based on my strong hand in 5s. This leverages my hand effectively and puts pressure on the next player.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have two 5s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold only one 6. For the bid of 4 6s to be correct, the other 16 unknown digits (8 from Player 3 and 8 from Player 5) would need to contain at least three more 6s. With each digit having about a 10% chance of being a 6, the likelihood of seeing three or more 6s in 16 digits is roughly 20%. That is too low for me to accept, so I will challenge the bid.
