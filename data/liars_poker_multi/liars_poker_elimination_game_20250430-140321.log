Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 31990073, which contains two 0s, one 3, two 7s, two 9s, and one 1. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I see in my hand. I have a total of 2 nines, so bidding on 9s seems like a good start. Considering there are 6 players and each has 8 digits, a bid of 8 9s seems too high because it assumes everyone has as many 9s as I do. A more conservative bid like 5 9s or 6 9s might be more reasonable, but starting with a lower quantity and digit is safer. I will bid 4 7s because I see two 7s in my hand and it's a relatively safe starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of 4 7s. Looking at my hand (67189348), I have one 7. With 6 players having 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For the bid of 4 7s to be valid, there need to be at least 4 sevens among all players. I already have 1, so we need 3 more from the other 5 players, which is quite reasonable. Since I know there's at least 1 seven (mine), and it's reasonable to expect 3 more among 40 other digits, I'll make a higher bid. I could bid 5 7s, but that might be pushing it. Instead, I'll bid 4 8s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit. I have one 8 in my hand, which gives me some confidence in this bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s. To raise minimally, I’ll switch to 9s at the same quantity. I need three more 9s among the 40 unknown digits to reach four; with an expected four and a probability around 78% this is still plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. The current bid is 4 9s, which is a low bid compared to the average expected count of 4.8 per digit across all players. Since I have no 9s, challenging risks losing due to the average likelihood of 4 9s existing. Bidding 5 4s leverages my three 4s and the statistical probability that others may hold additional 4s, making this a safer and strategic higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. There are 48 total digits. The expected number of any digit is 4.8. The bid of 5 is very close to the expected average, making a challenge risky. My hand is 20257141. I have one 4. I also have two 1s and two 2s. A higher bid must be at least 5 5s or 6 of any digit. Bidding based on my multiples seems strong. I have two 1s. The expected number of 1s among the other 40 digits (5 players * 8 digits) is 40 / 10 = 4. My two 1s plus the expected 4 from others equals 6. Therefore, bidding 6 1s is statistically supported by my hand and the overall distribution.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, the average count for any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8. A bid of 6 1s is slightly above average. I have one 1. I also have three 4s. A bid of 7 4s is a significant increase in quantity but is supported by my hand and the likelihood of other players having 4s. A bid of 6 4s would also be valid and safer, but 7 4s is a stronger bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 4s. My hand is 31990073, which contains two 4s and two 9s, and no other relevant digits in high quantity. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 4s, it's possible others have more, but 7 4s is a relatively high bid. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Bidding 8 4s seems too high without more information. Bidding 7 5s is a reasonable increase in digit, as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, and I have no 5s in my hand, making it plausible others might have some.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The current bid is '7 5s' made by Player 0, meaning they claim there are at least 7 fives among all players. Looking at my hand (67189348), I have zero 5s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. If the digits were evenly distributed, we'd expect about 4.8 of each digit (48 ÷ 10). So 7 fives is above average but not impossible. However, since I have none, all 7 would need to be in the other 5 players' hands, which is getting less likely. I could challenge, but it's still within reasonable bounds. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have one 6, one 7, one 8, and one 9 in my hand. I could bid '7 6s', '7 7s', '7 8s', or '7 9s', keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit. Since I have one 8 in my hand, I'll bid '7 8s' as a reasonable next move.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. That leaves 40 unknown digits, with an expected 4 more 8s (total ~6), making 7 8s unlikely (P≈37%). The bid is more likely false than true, so I should challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, contributing to the current bid of 5 8s. The expected total number of 8s across all 40 digits (including my hand) is approximately 5.2 based on statistical distribution, making the bid slightly favorable. Challenging carries a ~62% risk of failure. Instead, I can bid 6 4s, leveraging my three 4s and the statistical expectation that other players collectively hold ~3.2 4s, making a total of 6 reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. There are 5 players with 8 digits each, totaling 40 digits. The expected number of any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. My hand (20257141) contains only one 4. For the bid of 6 4s to be true, there must be at least 5 more 4s among the other 4 players (32 digits). The expected number of 4s in those other 32 digits is 3.2. Therefore, the expected total number of 4s across all hands is 1 (mine) + 3.2 = 4.2. A bid of 6 is significantly higher than the expected value. While Player 3 might have multiple 4s, the probability feels low enough to warrant a challenge, especially since I only contribute one 4.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. The current bid is 4 4s. With 4 players and 8 digits each, the average count of any digit is 3.2. Having three 4s in my hand makes a bid of 4 4s plausible, but it's also close to the expected value. Given my strong hand in 4s, I should consider bidding higher on 4s, but increasing the quantity to 5 might be too risky. Bidding on a different digit is also an option. I have one 1, one 2, one 3, one 5, and one 9. Bidding 5 of any of those digits seems too high. Bidding 4 on one of those digits is not a valid higher bid. The safest and most reasonable move is to bid 5 of a digit I have at least one of, or bid 4 of a higher digit. Bidding 4 5s is a valid higher bid and I have one 5. This seems more conservative than bidding 5 4s.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have the hand 31990073, which contains two 3s, one 1, two 9s, two 0s, and one 7, but no 5s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I don't have any 5s, I need to assess the likelihood of the bid being true. With 32 total digits and 4 players, a bid of 4 5s is plausible but uncertain. I can bid 4 6s to increase the digit, or increase the quantity to 5 5s. Given my hand and the fact that I don't see any 5s, I'll cautiously increase the digit to make a new bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. Bidding 5 4s builds on my initial bid of 4 4s this round and leverages my strong holding in 4s.

This avoids challenging a 4 8s bid that could realistically have 4+ 8s given Player 2's aggressive bidding history.

A bid of 5 4s is slightly above average expectation, but not wildly so, especially considering Player 3 might have multiple 4s. However, I have three 4s, meaning at least 5 4s exist.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. My hand is 31990073, which contains two 3s and no 4s. I can see that there are 32 total digits remaining among the 4 active players. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have no 4s, I suspect the total count of 4s might be lower than 6, but I should consider the information from previous bids and the fact that other players have more 4s. I will increase the digit to make a new bid. Bidding 6 5s is a reasonable next step as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 41432495. I have three 4s, one 1, one 3, one 2, one 9, and one 5. The current bid is 2 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand. With only 16 total digits, the expected number of any digit is around 1.6 (16/10). While 2 8s is possible, it's slightly above the average. Given I have no 8s, Player 2 would need to have both 8s. The previous challenge on 7 8s revealed an actual count of 6 (with 40 digits), and the challenge on 4 8s revealed an actual count of 4 (with 24 digits). The current bid of 2 8s with only 16 digits seems plausible, especially since Player 2 just survived a challenge on 4 8s. However, I have a strong hand of 4s (three of them). Bidding 3 4s is a valid higher bid and is well supported by my hand. Bidding 3 of any digit is higher than 2 8s. Since I have three 4s, a bid of 3 4s is very safe and a good strategic move.
