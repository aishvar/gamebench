Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (85176413), I don't have any 0s. Player 0 has bid 2 0s, which means they believe there are at least 2 zeros among all 48 digits. This is a very conservative bid, as statistically we'd expect about 4-5 zeros total (since each digit 0-9 should appear roughly equally). I could challenge, but with 5 other players having 40 digits I can't see, it's very likely there are at least 2 zeros. I should make a higher bid. I have one 1, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 8 in my hand. I could bid on any of these, but I'll go with a modest increase to '2 1s' since I already have one 1 in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have two 4s in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected number of any digit is around 4. My two 4s combined with the expected number from other players makes bidding 3 4s a reasonable and well-supported move. This bid is higher than 2 1s by increasing the quantity.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 5, 8, 0, 6, 4, 3, 6, 3. Counting the 4s, I see two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s, which I believe is close to the actual count, but I only have two 4s. Bidding 3 5s would be a safe higher bid, as I have at least one 5 in my hand, and the total number of 5s could be at most 8 (since I have only one 5). Alternatively, I could challenge if I think the bid is unlikely, but given I have only 2 4s, it's risky to challenge now. The safest move is to increase the bid to 4 5s, which is higher than 3 4s.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s, and raising to 4 6s is the smallest valid increase. Needing only two more 6s among the other 40 cards is very likely (probability >90%).

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 81867671, which contains two 6s. The current bid is 4 6s by Player 4. Since I have two 6s myself, it's plausible that there are at least two more 6s among the other 40 digits across the remaining players, making the total of 4 6s possible. However, I need to make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity to 5 6s or bid on a higher digit like 4 7s. Given that I also have two 7s in my hand, bidding 4 7s seems reasonable as it’s a higher digit and I have some support for 7s in my own hand. The likelihood of there being at least two more 7s in the remaining 40 digits is plausible. I’ll avoid challenging since the current bid of 4 6s isn’t outrageously high with 48 total digits in play. Therefore, I’ll bid 4 7s to escalate the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. Since the expected number of 7s across all players is ~4.8 (based on 48 total digits), the bid is plausible. However, I can bid a higher digit (8) with the same quantity (4) to maintain pressure. My hand has no 7s, but others might, so challenging risks losing. Bidding 4 8s is a logical next step.

Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (85176413), I have one 8. The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 0. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For there to be at least 4 8s, the other 5 players would need to have at least 3 more 8s among them, which is certainly possible. Since I already have one 8, I know there are at least that many. I could challenge, but it seems reasonable that there could be 4 or more 8s total. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have one 1 and one 3 in my hand, but bidding on those doesn't give me much advantage. I'll bid 5 0s, increasing the quantity. While I don't have any 0s in my hand, this is still a reasonable bid as there could easily be 5 or more 0s among 48 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. My hand contains one 0. The total number of digits is 48 across 6 players, making the average expected count for any digit 4.8. A bid of 5 0s is plausible, being close to the average expectation. Challenging this bid is risky. My hand contains two 4s, which is my strongest digit. Bidding on 4s is a good strategy. I need to bid higher than 5 0s. Bidding 5 4s would be a valid bid (same quantity, higher digit), requiring 3 more 4s from the other 5 players (40 digits total). The expected number of 4s from the other players is 40/10 = 4. Needing 3 is very likely. Bidding 6 4s is also a valid bid (higher quantity), requiring 4 more 4s from the other 5 players. Needing 4 more from 40 digits is exactly the average expectation. Bidding 6 4s is a plausible bid based on my hand and the statistical expectation, and it increases the quantity, putting more pressure on the next player. This seems like a stronger move than bidding 5 of another digit or challenging.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s by Player 2. My hand contains one '4' (from 58064363). Since the total number of '4's across all players is at most 6, bidding 7 4s would be impossible. Challenging the current bid is logical, as it seems highly unlikely that there are at least 7 fours in total. Challenging could win if the total '4's are fewer than 7, which is probable given my hand and the bids so far.

Player 3 Reasoning: The previous bid was 6 4s by Player 2, which was challenged and found to be inaccurate since the actual count was 5. Now, Player 3 starts the new round with no current bid. I need to make an initial bid. Considering my hand (58064363), I have two 4s and one 6. To be safe, I should bid a number that reflects the maximum I might have, but still conservative enough to avoid immediate challenge. Since I have at most two 4s and one 6, I can bid 2 4s or 2 6s. Bidding 2 4s seems reasonable, as I definitely have at least two 4s, and it is a safe opening bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand and there are 32 unknown digits. The probability of at least one more 6 among them is over 96%, making 3 sixes a safe raise. Bidding 3 sixes is a valid increase over 2 fours and leverages my hand strength.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 81867671, which contains two 6s and two 7s among other digits. The current bid is 3 6s by Player 4. Since I have two 6s myself, it's plausible that there are at least three 6s across all 40 digits, making a challenge risky. Instead, I will make a higher bid. I can increase the quantity to 4 and bid on 6s, or switch to a higher digit. Given that I also have two 7s, bidding 3 7s is a safer incremental increase, as it only raises the digit while maintaining the quantity, and I have some support for 7s in my hand. This seems like a reasonable bid to avoid an immediate challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which means there need to be at least 2 more 8s among the other 4 players' hands. With 5 players each having 8 digits, this is certainly possible. Looking at the previous round, Player 0 bid 4 8s, suggesting they might have some 8s in their hand. I could challenge, but it's a risky move as the bid is quite reasonable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 8 in my hand. I'll bid 3 9s, which is higher than 3 8s while being reasonable since I don't have any 9s in my hand, but there's a chance other players might have some.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s, which is quite high but still possible considering the total of 40 digits. My hand contains the digits 5, 8, 0, 6, 4, 3, 6, 3. Counting the 9s in my hand: I have none. Bidding 4 0s would be risky because I only have one 0, and the total remaining digits are 40, so the probability of there being at least 4 zeros is low. Bidding 3 9s seems unlikely given my hand. Challenging the current bid of 3 9s is a good move because even if I have some 9s, the total count of 9s across all hands is probably less than 3, especially considering previous bids and the fact that other players haven't bid higher on 9s. Therefore, challenging seems the best option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The previous bid was 'None', meaning no one has bid yet in this round. I have a total of 8 digits: 5, 8, 0, 6, 4, 3, 6, 3. Counting these, I have: 0 (1), 3 (2), 4 (1), 5 (1), 6 (2), 8 (1). The highest counts are for 0, 3, and 6, each with 2. To make a valid bid, I can bid 3 of any digit, or 2 of a higher digit. Since no previous bid exists, I can start with a bid that is reasonably conservative but still competitive. Bidding '3 6s' seems appropriate, as I have two 6s, but I cannot bid 3 6s because I only have 2. So I could bid 2 6s, but that is not higher than the previous bid (none). Alternatively, I can bid 3 3s or 3 0s, but I have only 2 0s and 2 3s. To be safe and slightly aggressive, I will bid 3 3s, which is higher than my actual count of 2, but since it's the first bid, it's valid. Alternatively, I could bid 2 6s to reflect my hand more accurately. Considering that, bidding 2 6s is safer and within my actual counts, and it's higher than no previous bid. Therefore, I will bid 2 6s.

Since I have two 6s myself, it's plausible that there are at least three 6s across all 32 digits, especially with four players. Challenging this bid seems risky as the count might easily be met. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I can bid 3 7s since it's a higher digit with the same quantity, and I have two 7s in my hand, making it a reasonable bid to continue the game without overreaching.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 3 8s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid. My hand contains no 8s, but this is a strategic move to push the bid higher without risking a challenge against the current 3 7s, which could be a bluff. The average expected count for 7s is around 3.2, making a challenge risky. Bidding 3 8s forces the next player to either outbid or challenge, maintaining pressure.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s, and I have one 8 in my hand. To beat this bid, I need to bid at least 4 0s or 3 9s, but I only have one 8 and no 9s. Since the total remaining digits are only 32, and I have at most one 8, the likelihood of there being 4 or more 8s overall is very low. Bidding higher on 8s is risky, and bidding on higher digits (like 9s) isn't possible without having a 9. Therefore, challenging seems the best move, as the previous bid is likely overstated.

There are 24 total digits across three players, so it's plausible that there could be more 6s. I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. Given that I have two 6s, I’ll bid 3 6s to stay conservative and test the waters, as it's a reasonable increase based on my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand and only one 8. Challenging 2 8s is risky since I’d need opponent to have no 8s (<44% chance). By bidding 3 6s, I leverage my two 6s and only need one more from them (~57% chance), and it’s strictly higher than 2 8s by increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 81867671, which contains two 6s, two 8s, two 7s, and two 1s. The current bid by Player 4 is 3 6s. Since there are only 16 total digits remaining across both players, and I have two 6s in my hand, it means Player 4 must have at least one 6 for the bid to hold. This is plausible, but I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Bidding higher, such as 3 7s, is safe since I have two 7s, and it's possible Player 4 has at least one 7 to make the total three. Alternatively, I could bid 4 6s, but that would require Player 4 to have two 6s, which is less certain. Given the history of bids and eliminations, Player 4 might be bluffing with 3 6s, but challenging now is risky since the bid is not extremely high. I will opt for a safer bid of 3 7s, as it aligns with my hand strength and is a valid higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have zero 7s in my hand and only Player 5’s 8 unknown digits remain. The chance they hold at least three 7s is extremely low (~4%), making the bid unlikely. I should challenge.
