Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, which is a good starting point. With 6 players having 8 digits each (48 total), and assuming a roughly even distribution of digits, each digit should appear around 4-5 times on average. Since I already see two 8s, bidding three 8s is a relatively safe opening bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains three 4s. The current bid is 3 8s. A bid of 4 4s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and is supported by the number of 4s in my hand, making it a relatively safe bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 39736838, which contains three 3s and three 8s, but no 4s. The current bid is 4 4s, which is not unreasonable given 48 digits in play. However, since I have a strong holding in 3s and 8s, I can make a higher bid in one of those digits, leveraging my hand strength. I will bid 4 8s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which means there would need to be at least three more 8s among the other five players (total of 40 digits). While possible, it's a bit risky to challenge. I can make a safer bid by increasing the digit to 9, which I also have one of, and keeping the quantity the same.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 39634727, which contains one 9. The current bid is 4 9s by Player 3. With 6 players and 48 total digits, it's possible that there are at least 4 9s across all hands, especially since I have one. However, I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Bidding higher, such as 5 0s, seems risky without knowing more about the distribution of digits. Since the bid of 4 9s is relatively low and plausible, Iâ€™ll make a higher bid of 5 0s to keep the game moving and test the waters, as 0 is a neutral digit to bid on without specific information.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 48 total digits and 6 players, the maximum count for any digit is 48. The current bid of 5 0s is relatively low considering the total possible count. I see that I have one 0, so there are at least 5 0s in total (since Player 4 bid 5 0s and they must have at least 4 other 0s). I can increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Bidding 5 1s seems reasonable because it increases the digit, and I have two 1s in my hand, making it plausible that there are more 1s across all hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have only one 1, and the current bid is '5 1s'. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total), having 5 1s is plausible but getting risky. I have two 0s in my hand, which suggests Player 4's bid of '5 0s' might be accurate. Since I can see only one 1 in my hand, and assuming a roughly even distribution of digits, the probability of finding exactly 4 more 1s among the other 40 unknown digits is relatively low. While I could bid '5 2s' to continue, the safer play is to challenge the '5 1s' bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (46810803), I have two 0s and one 8. Since this is the start of a new round with 5 players and 40 total digits, a conservative opening bid would be reasonable. Based on my hand, I know there are at least 2 zeros, so bidding '3 0s' would be a safe starting point, leaving room for escalation while being likely true given the distribution of digits.

Based on my hand, I have one 0. It's plausible there are at least 3 0s among all players. I have three 4s, which is strong. I can bid higher than 3 0s. Bidding 4 4s is a safe and reasonable increase based on my hand strength.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 3s, two 8s, one 9, one 6, and two 7s in my hand, but no 4s. The current bid is 4 4s, which is not unreasonable given 40 total digits in play. Since I have no 4s, I can't comfortably challenge yet, as it's plausible that the other 32 digits could have 4 or more 4s. I'll make a higher bid using a digit I have multiple of, such as 3s or 8s, to keep the pressure on others. I'll bid 4 8s since I have two 8s, increasing only the digit but not the quantity.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which means there would need to be at least 3 more 8s among the other 4 players (total of 32 digits). Given that 8s are relatively rare and the previous bid was also high, it's unlikely there are 4 8s in total. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: It's the start of a new round and I must make the opening bid. My hand contains three 3s, two 8s, two 6s, and one 9. Since I have two 8s and 8s have been bid successfully in previous rounds, starting with a modest bid based on my own hand is reasonable. I'll open with '3 8s', which is a standard, safe opening bid and aligns with my own hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 39634727, which contains no 8s. The current bid by Player 2 is 3 8s across all 32 digits from 4 players. Since I have no 8s, the bid relies entirely on the other players' hands. Given that there are only 24 digits outside my hand, a bid of 3 8s means roughly 12.5% of their digits would need to be 8s, which is plausible but not overly likely. However, looking at the bidding history, Player 2 previously bid 4 8s in an earlier round when there were more players, and the actual count was 5, suggesting they may have some 8s or confidence in the digit. Since the bid is relatively low at 3 8s, I think it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 4 7s feels reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 3 8s (since 7 is less than 8, I must increase quantity). However, to play conservatively and test the waters, I'll bid 4 0s, increasing the quantity and switching to a neutral digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand (46810803). The current bid of 4 0s by Player 4 is reasonable given there are 32 total digits remaining and I can see 2 of them. Since I have evidence supporting this bid and the quantity isn't too high relative to the total digits, challenging would be risky. I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I see I have one 8, so bidding '4 8s' would be too risky. A safer play would be to increase to '5 0s' since I already know of two 0s, or bid '4 1s' which is higher than '4 0s'. Given the uncertainty, bidding '4 1s' is the safer play as it requires finding fewer total digits across other players' hands.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 44504673. I have three 4s and one 0. The current bid is 4 1s. Bidding 5 4s is a strong possibility given my hand and the fact that there are 32 total digits. Bidding 5 0s is also possible but less likely than 5 4s based on my hand. Bidding 5 4s continues to increase the quantity, which is a standard strategy.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. In my hand (39736838), I have no 4s, which makes it risky to continue increasing the bid on 4s. To make a valid bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid 5 of a higher digit. I have three 3s and three 8s in my hand, but only one 9. Bidding 5 8s is plausible, as I have three myself, and the probability that there are at least two more among the other 24 digits is reasonable. Therefore, I will bid 5 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s made by Player 2. In my hand, I have no 8s. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 5 8s means that roughly 15.6% of the digits need to be 8s. Since I have none, the other 3 players would need to have all 5 among their 24 digits, which is about 20.8% of their digits. Looking at the bidding history, Player 2 has consistently bid on 8s, which might indicate they have some, but the bid of 5 seems high given I have none. However, challenging is risky because if they are correct, I get eliminated. Instead, I can make a safer bid of 6 0s, increasing the quantity. I have one 0 in my hand (from the digits 3,9,6,3,4,7,2,7), and historically, bids on 0s have been made (e.g., my own bid of 4 0s), so it might be plausible to push to 6. This avoids the risk of a challenge for now while still progressing the game.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand (46810803). The current bid is 6 0s, meaning there would need to be at least 4 more 0s among the other three players' hands to make this bid valid. While not impossible, this seems unlikely given that 0s haven't been prominently featured in previous rounds' bidding. Additionally, Player 4 has been aggressive with 0s bids (going from 4 to 6), which might indicate bluffing. Given these factors and the relatively high quantity of 6, challenging seems like the best option.

Since I have zero 4s, all 5 must come from the other two hands, which is unlikely (each would need to have 2-3 4s on average, but 4s are not more common than any other digit). Statistically, the probability that there are at least 5 4s in the other 16 digits is low. Therefore, I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 39736838, which contains two 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, so for Player 0's bid to be valid, there must be at least one 9 in their hand. With 16 total digits and 2 accounted for in my hand, it is plausible that Player 0 has at least one 9, making the bid likely. Raising to 4 9s would be risky as I only have 2. However, I have three 8s, so bidding 3 9s -> 4 8s is a reasonable and safe increment, leveraging my strong position in 8s.

Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (46810803), I have 0 eights. Player 2 has bid 4 8s, claiming there are at least 4 eights total between our 16 digits. Given that I have no eights, this means Player 2 would need to have at least 4 eights in their hand of 8 digits. While possible, having 50% of their digits be eights is quite unlikely. Additionally, Player 2's bidding pattern shows a strong preference for bidding on 8s (they've bid on 8s three times), which might indicate bluffing.
