Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning I can make any initial bid. I have 8 digits in my hand: 1, 8, 7, 7, 5, 5, 0, 1. I see that I have two 5s and two 7s. A reasonable initial bid would be to reflect the count of a digit I have. Bidding '2 5s' seems like a conservative and valid start.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 31768820. The current bid is 2 5s. I have zero 5s in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. On average, you'd expect about 4.8 of each digit. A bid of 2 5s seems low. Since I don't have any 5s, I can't confidently bid higher on 5s. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s. Bidding 3 8s is a safe and reasonable increase over the current bid, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. I can make a valid higher bid by increasing the quantity or digit. I have no other 8s, but I have a 9. I can make a bid of 3 9s, which is a higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 3 9s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. I have two 8s and one 5 in my hand, but since the current bid is on 9s, I should consider bidding on a digit that is likely to appear more frequently or match the quantity with a higher digit. Since I don't have any 9s, bidding on 9s is risky. However, considering the total number of digits remaining (48) and that each player has 8 digits, the maximum count for any single digit is 48. This means that bidding too high on any digit is risky. Given my hand and the current bid, I could try to increase the quantity or the digit. A safe increase would be to bid on a digit that I have in my hand or one that is close to 9 but still higher than 8, which I have. However, since I don't have a 9 or any digit higher than 9 to bid on, and increasing the quantity of 9s directly might be too risky without knowing other players' hands, I should consider challenging the bid if it seems unlikely or make a calculated bid based on the digits I have. Given that I have 8s and the previous bid was 3 8s, it seems there might be some 8s in other players' hands. But since the current bid is 3 9s, and I don't have any 9s, challenging seems like a viable option, especially considering the risk of overbidding. The bid of 3 9s seems plausible given that there are 48 digits in total, but without knowing the distribution, it's a gamble. Considering my options and the potential risk, challenging the current bid might be the best move, as it directly addresses the bid without requiring me to have or guess at the distribution of digits beyond my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I can make any bid. Since I have a 9 in my hand, I should start with a bid increasing both quantity and digit, making it 2 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (the digits are 3,5,9,2,2,1,7,2). To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since the current quantity is low, raising the quantity to 3 is reasonable. I do not have any 0s, but 0 is the lowest digit, so bidding 3 0s is a valid higher bid. This seems plausible because with 5 players and 40 digits total, having at least three 0s is not unlikely. This is a safe and valid bid to continue the game.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s made by Player 5. I have one 0 in my hand. Given that there are 3 other active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total number of digits across all players is 32. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. Since my hand contains one 0, and there could be up to 24 more 0s in the other players' hands, a bid of 1 0s seems very low and likely. However, I need to make a strictly higher bid. I can increase either the quantity or the digit. Bidding 2 0s seems reasonable given my hand and the possibility that others might have 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 2 0s. With 4 players and 32 total digits, the average count of any digit is 3.2. Having one 0 myself, it's plausible that there are at least two 0s in total among the four players. I can bid higher than 2 0s. Bidding 3 0s is a reasonable increase based on the average distribution and my own hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have 7 and 1 zero in my hand, totaling 2 zeros. Given that the current bid is low and I have a decent number of zeros, I can bid higher on zeros. However, since I don't have information about other players' hands, I should bid on a different digit where I have a stronger hand. I have 4 fours in my hand. Bidding 3 4s is a reasonable increase in quantity and digit, given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current total digits remaining is 24, and the highest bid so far is 3 digits. I have 4 digits in my hand including 4 and 5. Given the low total digits remaining and the fact that I have a higher digit than any previous bid, I should bid a higher quantity of a digit I have. However, since I don't have any 9s or higher, I'll increase the quantity of the next highest digit I have, which is 5.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 2. I have two 5s in my hand. Given that there are only 24 total digits remaining across 3 players (8 digits per player), and assuming Player 2 has at least 3 5s as per their bid, it's possible but unlikely that the total count of 5s is exactly 3 or more. However, I need to consider my own hand and potential bids from others. Since I have 2 5s, and assuming Player 2 has at least 3 5s, bidding 4 5s seems risky but could be valid if others have additional 5s. A safer approach would be to bid on a different digit or challenge. I notice I have two 7s, which no one has bid on yet. Given that the current bid is on 5s, I can try to bid higher on 5s or switch to another digit. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit and I have two 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 31768820. The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the average count of any digit is 2.4. A bid of 3 7s is slightly above average, but not unreasonable. I have two 8s in my hand, which makes bidding 4 8s a strong possibility. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid than 3 7s (higher quantity).

Player 1 Reasoning: I am the first to bid in this round with two players remaining and 16 total digits. My hand is 31768820. I have two 8s and one of each of 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. A safe starting bid is usually based on your hand. I have two 8s, so bidding 2 8s is a good starting point, indicating I have at least two and there might be more in the other player's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand, and there are 16 total digits remaining across both players. This means there could potentially be 2 8s in total if Player 1 has one as well. However, I do not have enough information to be certain that there are more than 2 8s. I also have a 7 and other digits that could be used to make a higher bid. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and uses a digit from my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 1. I have 8 secret digits: 18775501. I see that I have one 7 and no 8s. Given that the total number of digits across both players is 16 and the current bid is 4 8s, it seems unlikely that there are 4 or more 8s. However, I must consider my own hand and the possibility of Player 1 having 8s. My goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge if I think the bid is unlikely. Since I don't have any 8s, I will challenge the bid as it seems improbable.
