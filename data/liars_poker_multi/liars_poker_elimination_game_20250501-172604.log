Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the opening bidder I want a safe, modest bid. I already hold three 2s in my own hand, so I know the total count of 2s across all 48 digits is at least three. Any immediate challenge would automatically lose for the challenger. Therefore bidding 3 2s is guaranteed safe and sets a reasonable starting point for the round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. The average expected count per digit across all players is approximately 4.8. Bidding 4 0s represents a quantity below the average and is a valid increase over the current bid of 3 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I see no 0s in my hand, so the current bid of 4 0s could easily be true—challenging is risky. To overbid, I can keep the quantity at 4 and raise the digit. I have one 2, and with 40 unseen digits the expected number of additional 2s is about 4, making a total of 5 likely. Therefore, bidding 4 2s is a reasonable, legal raise that doesn’t push the quantity too high.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 61549785, which contains no 2s. The current bid is 4 2s, meaning at least four 2s are claimed among all 48 digits. Since I have zero 2s, it's possible, but not unlikely, that other players have enough 2s to meet this bid. Challenging now is risky, as four 2s across five other hands (40 digits) is plausible. To make a higher bid, I look for a digit I have multiples of. I have one each of 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, but two 5s. I can bid '4 5s', which is a valid increment (same quantity, higher digit), and is supported by my two 5s.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:2 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand, so the current bid of 4 5s requires at least three more 5s in the remaining 40 digits. The expected number of 5s in 40 digits is 4 (40/10), making the bid plausible. Bidding 4 6s (using my existing 6) increases the digit while maintaining a reasonable probability (expected 4 6s in total). Challenging risks elimination if the bid is valid, so a cautious bid is safer.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: As the first bidder in the round, I need to make an initial bid. My hand contains a 2, so bidding 3 2s is a reasonable starting point. With 5 players, the maximum possible for any digit is 5, and since I have one 2, it's plausible there are at least two more in other hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I’m already holding three 2s (222). With 32 unseen digits among the other four players, the chance that at least one more 2 exists is very high (about 96%). Therefore increasing the quantity to 4 while keeping the same digit is a safe, strictly higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, which gives me partial information suggesting there may be more 0s in play. Bidding 5 0s leverages my own digits while increasing quantity to a plausible total (considering 40 total digits and expected distribution). Challenging 4 2s is risky since the expected count for any digit is 4, making the bid likely valid.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:0 - o3-2025-04-16) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have zero 0s in my eight digits, leaving all 5 required zeros to be found among the 32 unknown digits. Under a uniform distribution each digit appears about 10% of the time, so the expected number of 0s in 32 digits is roughly 3.2. The exact binomial calculation gives only about a 21% chance that there are 5 or more 0s. With nearly an 80% chance that the bid is too high, challenging is the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. In the first round Player 4 successfully bid 4 6s and the revealed total was 6, indicating Player 4 likely holds multiple 6s. Even with two players eliminated, it is very plausible that at least four 6s remain among the 32 digits (my 1 plus probable 3+ from others). Opening with 4 6s is defensible, leverages known information, and is strictly higher than the current bid of None.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. With 32 digits in play and 4 players, the expected number of 6s is about 3-4. The current bid is 4 6s, which is plausible, but I don't have enough 6s to confidently challenge. Instead, I will make a higher bid with a digit I have more of. I have two 5s, so bidding 4 7s (since I have one 7) is riskier, but bidding 4 8s (I have one 8) is also risky. The safest legal bid is to increase the digit: BID: 4 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand contains no 7s, so the total number of 7s must come from the other three players. The expected number of 7s in 24 digits (3 players × 8 digits) is 2.4, making 4 7s unlikely. Challenging is the optimal move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: As the starting player, I need to make a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand contains one 2, so bidding 2 2s is a safe assumption since there are two other players who might also have a 2. This bid is low enough to be defensible but allows for escalation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold three 2s (out of my eight digits). That alone guarantees there are at least three 2s in play, regardless of what the other two players have. The current bid is 2 2s, so raising the quantity to 3 while keeping the digit at 2 is strictly higher and completely safe for me if it gets challenged.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I can safely raise the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have one 6, and earlier in the game we saw that six 6s existed among all 48 digits; with only half the digits now remaining it’s very plausible that at least two more 6s are still in play. Statistically, the chance of there being at least three 6s in 24 random digits is close to 50%, and my opponents also remember my previous confident bid of 4 6s, so they may hesitate to challenge. Therefore advancing the bid to 3 6s is both legal and strategically sound.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s. Considering the expected number of 6s across all players is 2.6 (based on 24 total digits), the bid of 3 is slightly above average. Bidding 4 6s increases the quantity while leveraging my existing 6, making it a plausible escalation. Challenging risks elimination if the bid is valid, and 3 6s has a reasonable chance of being correct.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:1 - o3-2025-04-16) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold three 2s (2,8,8,2,1,3,2,6). With only two other 8-digit hands unknown (16 digits), the probability of finding at least two more 2s is almost 50%. Moreover, earlier this round I already bid 3 2s, signalling to everyone that I have a strong 2 count. Because of that signal, both opponents must suspect I really do have several 2s, so they are less likely to challenge a higher quantity in 2s. Challenging the current bid of 4 6s looks risky: both opponents have shown interest in 6s (Player 2 first bid 3 6s; Player 4 raised to 4 6s), so the chance there are at least four 6s is high. Therefore, raising to 5 2s leverages my hand strength and is safer than a challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I see exactly one 2 in my own eight digits. For the current bid of 5 2s to be valid, Players 0 and 4 would have to hold at least four more 2s in their combined 16 digits. With a roughly 10% chance for any given digit to be a 2, the expected number of 2s in those 16 cards is about 1.6, and the probability of there being 4 or more is well under 10%. Bid history also shows Player 4 stopped at just 2 2s before switching to 6s, so large extra 2s are unlikely. Given these odds, challenging Player 0’s bid is the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I start the round with no existing bid. My hand contains three 2s (2,2,2). If I bid 3 2s, I am guaranteed the bid is true because I already meet the quantity myself, so I can never lose to a challenge. From my opponent’s point of view, the probability that there are at least three 2s across both hands is low, which may tempt them to challenge and instantly lose. Thus 3 2s is both safe for me and strategically attractive.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have one 2 in my hand, so at least one more is needed in Player 0's hand for the bid to be true. Bidding 3 3s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity. Since I have one 3, it's plausible Player 0 has two more 3s, making the bid reasonable. Challenging the current bid seems risky as it could be true. A higher bid like 3 3s is safer and leverages my existing 3 in hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: I already hold three 2s. To beat the current bid of 3 3s I can safely raise the quantity to 4 while switching back to the digit I’m strongest in. I’ll only need Player 4 to have one 2 in their eight digits for the bid to be true, which is better than a coin-flip (≈57%). Challenging 3 3s feels riskier because I have just one 3 and it’s quite plausible Player 4 is sitting on two or more 3s. Raising to 4 2s gives me the stronger statistical position and pressures Player 4 to decide.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have one 2 in my hand, so Player 0 would need at least 3 2s to make the total 4. Given the low probability of Player 0 having 3 or more 2s in their 8-digit hand (estimated at ~3.76% under uniform distribution), challenging the bid is statistically favorable. Previous challenges in the game have succeeded, suggesting aggressive bluffing is possible. Challenging here maximizes the chance of eliminating Player 0 if they are bluffing.
