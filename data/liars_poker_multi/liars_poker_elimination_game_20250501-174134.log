Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand (60711596), I have: one 0, one 1, two 1s, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 9. Since I have two 1s in my hand, I'll start with a conservative bid based on what I know for certain. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. A reasonable opening bid would be to claim there are at least 3 1s total, which is likely given I already have two of them myself.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand (42476966). The current bid is 3 1s. Bidding 3 6s is valid since it has the same quantity but a higher digit (6 > 1). Given my three 6s, there's at least a baseline chance this bid is truthful even without considering other players' hands, making it a safer and strategic increase.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (77603733). With 6 players and 8 digits each, the total possible 6s is 48. Player 1's bid of 3 6s seems reasonable as it only requires 2 more 6s among the other 40 digits I can't see. Since I need to make a higher bid or challenge, and 3 6s seems plausible, I should bid higher. I'll bid 4 6s, which is still reasonable given the distribution possibilities.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 43835196, which contains two 6s. The current bid is 4 6s by Player 2. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an average of about 4.8 of each digit is expected across all hands. Since I have 2 of the 6s, it's plausible that there are at least 2 more 6s among the other 40 digits, making the bid of 4 6s reasonable. However, I need to make a higher bid. I can bid 5 6s, but that feels risky as it assumes 3 more 6s in the remaining hands. Alternatively, I can switch to a higher digit with the same quantity. My hand has two 3s, so bidding 4 3s might not be strong. I also have one 8 and one 9. Bidding 4 8s or 4 9s could work, but 9s might be less likely. I'll bid 5 6s to stay on the same digit and increase the quantity slightly, hoping my two 6s support this bid being close to the truth.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 3. I have two 6s in my hand. I should bid a higher quantity or a higher digit to increase my chances of winning. Bidding 6 6s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 7 6s is a safe increase. I could also bid 6 of a higher number, but I don't have enough information to make that decision. I'll stick with a small increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The current bid is 7 6s made by Player 5. Looking at my hand (60711596), I have one 6. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For the bid of 7 6s to be true, there need to be 6 more 6s among the other players' hands. That's certainly possible, but the bidding pattern shows multiple players raising on 6s, which suggests they might have 6s in their hands. However, the bid has been increasing steadily from 3 6s to 7 6s, which is concerning. I have two options: 1) Bid higher (either 8 6s or 7 7s or higher), or 2) Challenge. Since I only have one 6, and the bid is already at 7 6s, I think it's safer to challenge rather than push the bid higher with little evidence to support it.

Player 5 Reasoning: Since there are no current bids, I can make an initial bid. I have one 4, one 5, one 6, two 8s, one 3, and one 7 in my hand. I will bid a small quantity of a digit I have, such as 1 8.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand, making a bid of 2 6s a safe and truthful move. Since the current bid of 1 8s is low and challenging it would risk elimination (as the expected count of 8s across 40 digits is around 4), it's better to build on my strong 6s. A bid of 2 6s is valid, higher in quantity than the current bid, and supported by my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (77603733). Given there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total), and the previous round revealed there were 8 sixes when there were 48 digits, it's very likely there are still several 6s in play. Since I have one 6, and Player 1 is bidding conservatively at just 2 6s, I can safely bid '3 6s' to increase the quantity while keeping the same digit. This is a relatively safe bid given the historical information.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 43835196, which contains two 6s. The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 2. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average number of any digit across all hands would be around 4. Since I have two 6s, it's plausible that there are at least 3 6s in total, but the bid is still low enough that I can safely raise it. I will bid 4 6s to increase the quantity while staying within a reasonable range based on my hand and the total possible digits. I am not challenging yet because the current bid of 3 6s seems believable given the previous round's outcome of 8 6s with 6 players.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I could bid higher, but I'm not confident in the total number of 6s. I also have two 8s in my hand, but the previous bid was 1 8s, so others might be bidding up the 8s. I don't want to bid too high and risk being challenged. I think 5 6s is a reasonable bid, so I'll challenge to see if they are bluffing.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. Since the current bid is 3 7s, bidding 4 6s is a valid higher bid (increased quantity) and leverages my strong holding of 6s. Previous rounds showed high counts for 6s, making this bid plausible even with limited knowledge of others' hands.

Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (77603733), I have zero 6s. Player 1 has bid 4 6s, meaning they claim there are at least 4 sixes among all 32 digits. Given that I have none, and we've seen in previous rounds that there were 6-8 sixes when more digits were in play, it's plausible that 4 sixes exist among the other players' 24 digits. I could bid higher, but without any 6s in my hand, I'd be taking a risk. Since I have three 7s in my hand, I could bid '4 7s', which would be a valid higher bid. This feels safer since I personally contribute 3 of the 4 needed 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 43835196, which contains no 7s. The current bid is 4 7s by Player 2. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 4 7s means that there should be at least 4 sevens in play. Since I have none, the other 3 players must collectively have at least 4 sevens in their 24 digits. This is possible (e.g., one player could have 4 sevens, or they could be distributed), but it's not extremely likely given the average expectation of about 2.4 sevens across 24 digits (assuming uniform distribution). However, previous rounds show a tendency for higher counts of specific digits (e.g., 8 sixes in the first round, 6 sixes in the second), so digits might be clustered. Bidding history also shows Player 2 escalated from 4 6s to 4 7s, which might indicate confidence in sevens or a bluff. I could challenge, but the risk is high since 4 7s is plausible. Instead, I'll make a safer bid of 5 6s, as I have two 6s myself, and past rounds suggest sixes have been abundant (at least 6 in the last round). This bid increases the quantity and seems reasonable based on history.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. The current bid of 6 6s requires at least three more 6s among the remaining 24 digits (3 players). Statistically, the expected number of 6s in 24 random digits is ~2.4, making the total count of 6s (3 + 2.4 = 5.4) likely below the bid. While previous rounds saw higher-than-expected counts, the probability favors challenging this bid as the required total exceeds statistical likelihood.

Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (77603733), I have 0 sixes. Player 1 is claiming there are at least 4 sixes total. Given the previous rounds, we've seen that 6s were relatively common (5-8 sixes in earlier rounds). However, with only 24 total digits now and me having zero 6s, it seems unlikely there are 4 or more sixes between just Player 1 and Player 3's hands. The previous rounds also showed Player 1 frequently bidding on 6s, which might be a bluff pattern. Based on this, challenging seems like the best option.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 43835196, which contains two 6s. The current bid by Player 1 is 4 6s, and with a total of 16 digits across both players, it's possible that there are at least two more 6s in Player 1's hand to meet the bid. Given the history of bids on 6s and previous rounds where the count of 6s was at least 5, it's plausible that 4 6s exist. However, I need to make a higher bid. I can bid 5 6s, but with only two 6s in my hand, and considering the total digits, it feels risky as Player 1 might challenge if they have fewer 6s. Alternatively, I can switch to a higher digit with the same quantity. My hand has two 3s, one 4, one 5, one 8, one 9, and two 6s. Bidding on 4 7s or higher digits feels safer since I have no 7s, 8s, or 9s to support a high bid there, but 4 7s is a conservative increase. I'll go with 4 7s to test Player 1's response without overcommitting on quantity.
