Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 97075491, I notice I have two 9s and a 7, among other digits. Since the goal is to make a bid that is reasonable yet challenging for others to follow, I'll choose a digit I have at least one of and make a conservative quantity bid. Bidding on a digit I have, like the 9, could be strategic, but starting with a lower quantity and a higher digit might give me an advantage. However, considering the total number of digits and the need to start the bidding, I'll opt for a lower digit with a moderate quantity, taking into account the distribution of digits might not be even.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits. On average, each digit should appear 4.8 times. A bid of 3 7s is quite low and likely to be true, making a challenge risky this early. I have zero 7s. I need to make a higher bid. Possible bids are 3 8s, 3 9s, or 4 of any digit. My hand is 98644605. I have two 4s and two 6s. Bidding based on my hand is a good strategy. Bidding 4 6s is higher than 3 7s, leverages the two 6s in my hand, and is statistically plausible (needing only two more 6s among the remaining 40 digits).

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (from 82152131). The current bid is 4 6s, which means there would need to be at least 3 more 6s among the other 5 players (40 digits). This seems plausible but not certain. To stay safe, I can bid a higher digit with the same quantity, like 4 7s, since I have one 7 in my hand and the previous bid was 3 7s, indicating some likelihood of more 7s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have only one 7 in my hand, so I cannot support a bid of 4 7s or higher. Bidding higher on 7s (like 5 7s) is impossible because there are only 8 total 7s in the game, and I have only one. The previous bid is quite high, but challenging might be risky if the count is actually close. However, with only one 7 in my hand, it's unlikely that the total number of 7s across all players reaches 4. Challenging seems the safest move here.

Player 3 Reasoning: The previous bid was 4 6s, which was challenged and found to be false (actual count 3). Now, with no current bid, I can start by bidding a slightly higher quantity or digit. Given my hand (0,5,6,1,9,2,1,4), I have one 5 and one 6, and no other 6s. Bidding 4 6s would be risky since I only have one 6. Instead, I can bid 4 5s, which I have in my hand, and it's a plausible bid considering the total remaining digits. This increases the bid safely and keeps the game progressing.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s and no 5s in my hand. The probability of four 5s among 40 digits is under 40%, making the current bid shaky. Bidding 4 6s leverages my two 6s and still has about an 84% chance of being valid, so it's a safer raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 7s and my hand containing one 7, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least four 7s among all active players. Since I have one 7 and there are 40 digits in total, spread across 5 players, it's possible but not highly probable that the total count of 7s reaches or exceeds four, especially considering the distribution of digits. However, without more information about the other players' hands, making a higher bid (either in quantity or digit) seems risky. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40 and we are already at a bid of 4 for a specific digit, challenging seems like a viable option, especially since the last bid was not extremely high and the challenger in the previous round won, indicating that bids might be overestimations. Since I only have one 7, and considering the previous challenge outcome where the actual count was lower than bid, I lean towards challenging the current bid as it seems unlikely to have at least four 7s among all players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current state of the game with no bids yet and considering my hand 97075491, I notice I have two 7s and one 9, one 0, one 4, one 5, and one 1. Since the game just started with 4 players and 32 digits in total, and I have a decent spread of digits, I should make a bid that is reasonable and slightly optimistic. Bidding on a digit I have at least one of seems prudent. Considering my digits, bidding on 7s could be a good start since I have two of them, and it's a relatively high digit. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 4 players, a bid of 3 7s or higher could be reasonable if I consider the distribution might not be perfectly even. However, since the current bid is 'None', I can start with a lower quantity to test the waters and avoid overbidding early in the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s with 32 total digits. The expected number of any digit is 3.2. I have zero 7s in my hand (98644605). For the bid to be true, there must be at least three 7s among the other 24 digits held by Player 0, Player 3, and Player 4. This is statistically plausible (expected 7s in those 24 digits is 2.4), making a challenge risky, especially as it's an opening bid. Previous rounds saw challenges on 4 7s fail when the count was 3, suggesting 3 7s might be accurate or a safe bluff. I have two 6s and two 4s in my hand. Bidding based on my own digits is safer. Bidding 4 6s requires only two more 6s among the other 24 digits, which is statistically likely. This bid leverages my hand's strength and increases the quantity, putting pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s, and I know I have '0 5 6 1 9 2 1 4' in my hand. Counting my own digits, I have one 6. To beat the bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 6, I cannot make a higher bid of 5 6s. The only way to beat 4 6s is to bid on a higher digit, such as 4 7s, 4 8s, or 4 9s, but I have no 7s, 8s, or 9s. I only have one 5, which is less than 6, so I can't bid 4 5s. Therefore, challenging the bid seems the most logical move, as the count of 6s across all players is unlikely to reach 4, given my hand and previous bids.

Player 1 Reasoning: I am Player 1 and I need to make the opening bid. My hand is 98644605. I have two 6s and two 4s, which are my most frequent digits. There are 3 players and 24 total digits. The expected average count for any digit is 2.4. Since I have two 6s, bidding '3 6s' is a reasonable starting point. This bid suggests I believe there's at least one more 6 among the other 16 digits held by Player 0 and Player 4, which is statistically probable (expected value of 1.6 additional 6s). It leverages one of my strongest digits and sets a non-trivial opening bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand and need to raise the bid above 3 6s. By bidding 3 8s, I only need at least one more 8 among the 16 unknown digits. With a 10% chance per digit, there’s about an 81% chance of at least one more 8, making three total. This is a reasonably safe raise.

Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 8s' by Player 4 and considering my hand '97075491', I notice I have one 8 and one 9. Since the bid is on '8s' and I have one, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least three 8s among all players. With 24 total digits remaining and each player having 8 digits, the maximum number of any single digit is 24, but given the distribution and previous bids, it seems plausible that there could be at least three 8s. However, without more information on the other players' hands, it's a gamble to challenge. Given my own hand, I could try to increase the bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 9, which is higher than 8, and considering the strategic aspect of not wanting to bid too high too quickly, I can bid on the 9s, increasing the digit from 8 to 9, which is a higher bid and takes into account my own hand's composition.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 0. I hold one 9 in my hand (98644605). For the bid to be true, there must be at least two more 9s among the remaining 16 digits held by Player 0 and Player 4. The expected number of 9s in those 16 digits is 1.6 (16 * 0.1). The probability of there being 0 or 1 nine in the other hands is slightly higher than the probability of there being 2 or more 9s (approx. 51.4% vs 48.6%). Making the next available bid (4 0s) is risky as I only have one 0, requiring three more from the other 16 digits (low probability). Bidding 4 4s or 4 6s (I have two of each) requires two more from the other 16 digits, which has roughly a 48.6% chance of being true, similar to the chance of 3 9s being true. Given the probabilities slightly favor the challenge and Player 0 just raised the digit without increasing quantity, challenging seems like the most strategically sound move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current state of the game with only two players remaining and 16 total digits, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. Since my hand contains the digits 97075491, I notice I have one 9 and one 7. Considering the game history and the fact that no bids have been made yet in this round, I should aim to make a bid that is reasonable based on my hand. Since I have a 9, which is the highest digit, bidding on it could be strategic. However, given that the highest possible count for any digit is 16 and I only have one 9, bidding high on 9s might not be the best strategy. On the other hand, bidding on a digit I have, like 7, could be safer. But, considering the need to make a bid that is strictly higher than 'None' and taking into account the digits I have, I should consider what would be a safe yet competitive bid. Given that I have one 7 and the game has just started with no previous bids to compare against, a modest bid seems appropriate.

Thus, bidding 2 9s seems like a reasonable move as it increases the digit value from 8 to 9, making it a higher bid without requiring knowledge of the exact distribution of digits in Player 4's hand.
