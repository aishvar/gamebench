Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. With 40 unknown digits and a 10% chance per digit to be a 6, we expect about four more 6s. The probability of seeing at least two additional 6s (for a total of five) is over 90%, making “5 6s” a strong, credible opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 85779312, which contains no 6s. The current bid is 5 6s by Player 0. With 48 total digits across 6 players, an average of 4.8 digits of any number would be expected if distributed evenly. A bid of 5 6s is slightly above average but still plausible. However, since I have no 6s in my hand, I am slightly skeptical, but not enough to challenge yet as it's still early in the round. I will make a higher bid to keep the game moving and test the waters. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 5 7s feels reasonable as it increases the digit while maintaining the quantity, and I contribute to the count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have zero 7s in my hand (80094896). This means the other 5 players must have at least five 7s among their combined 40 digits for the bid to be true. The expected number of 7s in those 40 digits is 4 (40/10). While 5 is only slightly above the expectation, my lack of 7s makes the bid less likely. However, challenging this early is risky. I have two 8s and two 9s. Bidding 5 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires at least five 8s in total across all 48 digits. Since I hold two 8s, only three more are needed from the remaining 40 digits. The expected number of 8s in those 40 digits is 4. Therefore, bidding 5 8s is statistically well-supported by my hand and safer than challenging 5 7s at this stage.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 5 8s. Bidding 5 9s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity. Since 9 is the next higher digit after 8, this is a valid and cautious bid. Challenging the 5 8s bid carries risk because the expected number of 8s in 48 digits is around 4.8, making 5 plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Increasing the quantity to 6 9s seems risky given I have no 9s. Increasing the digit to 5 0s, 5 1s, 5 2s, 5 3s, 5 4s, 5 5s, 5 6s, 5 7s, or 5 8s are all possible. Since the previous bids have been increasing the digit, I will continue that pattern. I have two 2s, so bidding 6 2s is a reasonable, though potentially risky, move to increase the bid. It's higher than 5 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s, meaning there are at least six 2s in all hands combined. I have the digits 3, 5, 8, 5, 4, 7, 6, 7. Counting my 2s: I have none. The maximum total 2s possible in all hands is 6 (from my hand) plus the other 5 players' digits. Given that the total is 48 digits, and previous bids have been high for other digits, it's unlikely that there are at least six 2s overall. Challenging now seems the safest move.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is None. I have two 2s in my hand. Bidding 1 2s is a safe and reasonable starting bid, given my hand and the total digits remaining (32). It's a low bid, but it establishes a baseline and doesn't reveal too much information.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 2s by Player 4, which is a very low bid and almost certainly true since it only requires one 2 across all hands. My hand is 85779312, which contains one 2. Since I have one 2, and the total number of digits is 32, it's reasonable to assume there could be more 2s in other players' hands. I should make a higher bid rather than challenge such a low and likely bid. I'll bid 2 3s, increasing both the quantity and the digit, as a safe incremental bid to keep the game moving while not overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. With 32 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 3.2. Therefore, a bid of two 3s is statistically very likely to be true, making a challenge extremely risky. I have zero 3s in my hand (80094896). My hand contains two 0s, one 4, one 6, two 8s, and two 9s. I should make a higher bid based on my hand. Options for a higher bid include 2 4s, 2 5s, ..., or 3 0s, 3 1s, ... . I have two 0s, making a bid of 3 0s plausible and relatively safe, as I only need one more 0 among the other 24 digits held by the other three players. This leverages my hand strength while being a modest increase from the current bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains two 5s. The current bid is 3 0s, which is likely true given the expected distribution of digits. Bidding 4 5s increases the quantity and leverages my two 5s, making it a plausible higher bid. Challenging would risk elimination if the 3 0s claim is accurate.

Considering my hand and the history, challenging seems like a good option as there are only 32 total digits and 4 5s seems plausible but not guaranteed. A higher bid would be risky without knowing the other players' hands.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is None. I have two 2s in my hand. Bidding 3 2s is a reasonable starting bid, as it's based on my hand and increases the quantity from the initial bid of None. It's a conservative bid, but given the limited number of players (3) and total digits (24), it's unlikely to be immediately challenged.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 85779312, which contains one 2. The current bid is 3 2s by Player 4. With 24 total digits across three players, it's possible that there are at least two more 2s in the other players' hands, making the bid of 3 2s plausible. However, looking at the history, Player 4 has consistently bid on 2s and even won challenges with higher counts like 6 2s when more players were in the game. Now with fewer players and only 24 digits, their confidence in 2s might still hold, but I have to bid higher. I can bid 3 3s since I have one 3 in my hand, which might be a safer incremental increase while still meeting the requirement to bid higher (same quantity, higher digit). Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to 4 on a different digit, but with limited information, sticking to a digit I have is better. I’ll go with 3 3s to keep the bid conservative yet progressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s made by Player 1. I have zero 3s in my hand (80094896). For the bid to be true, the other two players (Player 1 and Player 4) must have at least three 3s combined in their 16 digits. While possible, the expected number of 3s in those 16 digits is only 1.6. Challenging is an option. However, my hand contains two 8s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid next step (same quantity, higher digit). Since I hold two 8s, this bid only requires one more 8 to exist among the 16 digits held by the other two players, which is statistically very likely. Making a strong bid based on my hand seems strategically better than challenging a relatively low bid early with only 3 players remaining.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I am Player 2 and need to make the opening bid. My hand is 80094896. There are 16 total digits (8 mine, 8 Player 1's). I have two 0s, one 4, one 6, two 8s, and two 9s. The safest bids are based on digits I hold. I hold two 0s, two 8s, and two 9s. A bid of '2 9s' is the highest bid guaranteed solely by my hand. However, a bid of '3' for any of these digits is statistically plausible, as Player 1 would only need one of that digit (expected count in their hand is 8/10 = 0.8). Bidding '3 0s' is a reasonable opening bid; it leverages my two 0s, assumes Player 1 has at least one 0 (which is likely), and starts at the lowest digit for quantity 3, leaving bidding room.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 85779312, and I have no 0s. The current bid by Player 2 is 3 0s, meaning there should be at least three 0s across both our hands (16 digits total). Since I have none, all three 0s would need to be in Player 2's hand for the bid to be true. Given that each player has 8 digits, it's possible but not highly likely for Player 2 to have three or more 0s (probability-wise, it's less than 50% for a specific digit to appear three or more times in 8 digits). However, challenging carries a risk, and since the bid is relatively low (3 out of 16), it might be safer to bid higher. I have two 7s and two 9s in my hand, so bidding on one of those digits could be believable. I'll bid 3 7s, as it's a higher digit than 0 and leverages my own hand strength while keeping the quantity conservative.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s made by Player 1. I have zero 7s in my hand (80094896). For the bid to be accurate, Player 1 must possess at least three 7s within their 8 digits. The probability of a player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is low (approximately 3.8%). Given that I hold none of the bid digit, the likelihood of the bid being true is very small. Therefore, challenging is the statistically advantageous move.
