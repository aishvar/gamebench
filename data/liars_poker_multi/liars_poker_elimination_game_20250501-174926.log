Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand (23824264), I have: one 2, one 3, one 8, one 4, one 2, one 6, one 4. That's two 2s, two 4s, one 3, one 8, and one 6. Since I have two 2s and two 4s in my hand, these are good digits to bid on. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. I'll start with a conservative bid of 7 4s, which means I'm expecting to find 5 more 4s among the other 40 digits held by other players, which is reasonable.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have the digits 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 7, 9 in my hand. Counting the 4s, I have zero. The current bid is 7 4s, which is quite high. Given my hand, I cannot increase the quantity of 4s, and my only option is to challenge, as it's unlikely that there are at least 7 fours among all players' hands. Challenging now is a strategic move to potentially eliminate Player 0 if they are bluffing.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The previous bid was 7 4s, which was challenged and found to be false since only 4 fours exist. Now, with no current bid and my hand containing 13133279 (which includes one '4'), I can make a conservative bid. Since the total digits are 40 and I have one '4', it seems safe to bid slightly higher than the previous bid, but I should not overestimate. Bidding 8 4s would be reasonable, but I only have one '4' in my hand, so I can't support that. The next logical bid is to increase the quantity to 8, but I only have one '4' in my hand, so I can't realistically claim more than one '4'. Therefore, I will bid 1 4s, which is the minimal higher bid than no current bid, or I could bid 8 4s if I had enough '4's, but I don't. Since no bid exists yet, I can start with a safe bid of 4 4s, which is a reasonable opening bid, or I could bid 1 4s to be more conservative. Given my limited '4's, I will bid 4 4s to be more aggressive and to set a challenging yet plausible bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand, and the current bid is 4 4s. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Bidding 4 5s is reasonable because 5s are less common than 4s, but it's a valid higher bid and puts pressure on the next player.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s, which aligns with the average expected count of 4 per digit across all hands. Since I have no 5s, challenging risks elimination if the bid is accurate. Bidding 4 7s (same quantity, higher digit) is valid and leverages my hand's strength in 7s, assuming others may have at least two more to meet the bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits: 84652516. I see that I have two 6s and one 7 in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40 and there are 40 total digits remaining, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. Since I have one 7, I can try to bid higher on 7s or switch to a different digit. Bidding 5 7s would be a straightforward increase in quantity, but I should also consider if bidding on a different digit could be more advantageous.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit value while keeping the quantity the same. This could potentially lead to a challenge from other players, but it's a valid bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 6 7s is unlikely, as it would require at least one other player to have three 7s, which is possible but risky. Bidding 5 8s is a valid higher bid and leverages the 8s in my hand. Challenging seems premature since the bid is not extremely unlikely.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. Given my hand (13133279), I have only one 8, so it's impossible for the total to be 5 or more. Challenging the bid is the safest move, as the actual count of 8s across all players cannot reach 5. Bidding higher would be risky and unlikely to succeed, so I will challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current round has no bids yet, so I can make an initial bid. My hand contains the digits 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 7, 9. Counting these, I have: 1s: 2, 3s: 3, 2s: 1, 7s: 1, 9s: 1, and no 4s, 5s, 6s, or 8s. Since the total remaining digits are 32, I can confidently bid 3 3s, as I have three 3s, and it's a reasonable starting bid that others can challenge or raise.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s, which is reasonable but not very high. I can increase the bid by either raising the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 7, I can bid 3 7s to keep the quantity the same but increase the digit, making it harder for others to challenge immediately.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits: 84652516. I see one 0 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains two 5s and a 6, which are higher digits, and I have one 0, I can consider bidding higher. However, bidding 5 0s seems risky without knowing others' hands. I can bid 4 1s or higher digit with a reasonable quantity. Given my hand, bidding 4 5s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. My hand contains the digits 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 7, 9. I have no 5s, so the maximum number of 5s I could contribute is zero. Bidding higher on 5s (like 5 5s) is impossible. Bidding on 4 7s could be plausible given I have three 3s and one 7, but I only have one 7, so I can't reach 4. Bidding 4 3s would be truthful if I had four 3s, but I only have three. The current bid is 4 5s, and since I cannot realistically meet or exceed that, I should challenge the bid, assuming it's unlikely that there are at least 5 fives in total.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current round has just started with no bids placed yet. Given my hand (1,3,1,3,3,2,7,9), I have a total of 8 digits.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one '3' in my hand (68502797). Given that there are 24 digits total and 3 players, having at least 3 '3's is plausible. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. I do not have many '3's, but I have two '7's, which might be a better digit to bid on. The current bid is 3 3s, so I can bid 3 7s to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This is a reasonable and safe bid based on my hand and the current bid.

I have two 7s, but bidding 5 7s would be higher than 5 0s and potentially risky. Bidding 6 0s increases quantity and is a safer higher bid based on the current bid.

To make a valid higher bid, I can increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since the current bid is 6 7s, the next higher bid could be 6 8s or 7 0s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid of 7 0s requires at least 7 zeros in total. I have 3 zeros in my hand (71047003), meaning Player 2 would need at least 4 zeros to validate the bid. Given the aggressive bidding history on zeros and Player 2's likely possession of 4+ zeros, this bid could be valid. However, challenging carries a high risk but is necessary to avoid escalating with a weak position on zeros. If Player 2 has fewer than 4 zeros, the challenge succeeds.
