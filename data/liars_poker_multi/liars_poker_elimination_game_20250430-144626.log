Player 0 Reasoning: Since it's the first bid, I can bid any valid quantity and digit. I have two 2s, one 3, one 4, two 5s, one 6, and one 7 in my hand. A conservative bid would be 1 7s, but to be slightly more aggressive and potentially deter challenges, I'll bid 2 2s. This is based on my hand and is a reasonable starting bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 2s', which is a very low bid considering there are 48 total digits. The expected number of any digit is 4.8. I have one '2' in my hand (52873960), meaning only one more '2' is needed across the other 40 digits for the bid to be true. This is highly probable, making a challenge very risky. I should make a higher bid. A minimal increase is strategically sound at this early stage. Bidding '2 3s' is a valid next bid (same quantity, higher digit). I have one '3' in my hand, making this a relatively safe bid as it only requires one more '3' among the remaining 40 digits.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 75842576, which contains no 3s. The current bid is 2 3s, which is quite conservative given there are 48 digits in play. Statistically, each digit should appear about 4.8 times. Since I have no 3s but the bid is low, it's very likely that at least two 3s exist among the other 40 digits. Challenging would be risky. The minimum valid higher bid is 2 4s. My hand has one 4, so this is a safe incremental bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 2 4s. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable increase, as it raises both the quantity and the digit. This bid is likely to be higher than the actual count, but it's a calculated risk to potentially eliminate another player if challenged.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 3. I have the digits 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 6, 3, 3 in my hand, which means I have one 5. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 5, increasing the quantity to 4 seems risky without knowing the distribution of 5s among other players. However, I can see that bidding 3 6s would be a safer option as it's higher in digit value and I have two 6s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I need to decide whether to raise the bid or challenge. Looking at my hand: 8, 0, 1, 6, 0, 1, 4, 0, I have exactly one 6. Since only one 6 exists in my hand and the total is already bid at 3 6s, it's unlikely that there are 3 sixes in total across all hands. Challenging the bid seems the best move, as the bid appears inflated given my hand and the known maximum total of 48 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning I can make any initial bid. I have the digits 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 6, 3, 3 in my hand. Counting my digits, I have two 6s, three 3s, and one each of 4, 5, 2, 8. A reasonable bid to start with would be to bid on a digit I have multiple of. Bidding '3 3s' seems like a strong opening bid since I have three 3s and it's a higher quantity than the previous bids made in the last round.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. Bidding 4 3s is a possibility, but it's risky. I could also bid on a different digit. I have two 2s, two 5s, one 4, one 6, and one 7. Bidding 4 4s is a valid option, as it increases the quantity. Bidding 3 4s would not be higher. Bidding 3 5s would also be valid, but I'd rather try to leverage the 4s, as it's a higher quantity. Since the previous player was successful with a relatively high bid (3 6s), it's reasonable to attempt a slightly higher bid. I'll bid 4 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. The expected average count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. Therefore, a bid of 4 4s is statistically average and challenging it is risky, even though I have zero 4s in my hand (52873960). The other 32 digits could easily contain four 4s. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 4 5s (or higher digit) or 5 0s (or higher quantity). Bidding 4 5s is the minimal increase. I have one 5 in my hand, which slightly supports this bid. It keeps the quantity at the average level, making it a relatively safe and plausible bid to pass the pressure to the next player.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 75842576, which contains two 5s. The current bid is 4 5s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in play. Statistically, each digit should appear about 4 times. Since I personally hold two 5s, it's likely that the bid of 4 5s is valid, and possibly conservative. It is too risky to challenge at this stage. The next valid bid must be either 4 6s or 5 of any digit. I have two 7s and two 6s in my hand, making '4 6s' a safe incremental bid, especially since 6s are less likely to have been concentrated in other hands, and I have a strong showing myself.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s. Since I have two 6s, it is likely that there are at least 5 6s in total. Bidding 5 6s is a reasonable move to increase the quantity based on my hand and the previous bids. I am not challenging because I have a 6 in my hand, making it more likely that the bid is valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 3. I have 2 sixes in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 secret digits, there are a total of 40 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. I should assess the likelihood of there being at least 5 6s. Since I only have 2 sixes and there are 4 other players, it's possible but seems unlikely that the total count of 6s is 5 or more. I should consider bidding higher or challenging. My hand also contains a 3 and a 4, but no 5s or higher quantity of any single digit that stands out as obviously more likely than 5 6s. I will challenge the bid as it seems unlikely.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The previous round ended with a bid of 5 6s, which was successful. Given that there are 32 digits remaining across 4 players, bidding 6 6s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on the previous successful bid and my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 7 6s is a reasonable increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit, but given the previous history and my hand, sticking with 6s seems strategically sound. Bidding 6 7s is also an option, but 7 6s feels more likely to succeed than 6 7s given the previous rounds and the limited number of digits remaining.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s made by Player 0. I have one 6 in my hand (52873960). This means 6 more 6s are needed among the other 24 digits held by Players 0, 2, and 3 for the bid to be true. While 7 is significantly higher than the expected number of 6s (32/10 = 3.2), the bidding history suggests 6s might be plentiful. Player 3 bid 6 6s, and Player 0 immediately raised to 7 6s. Previous rounds also saw high counts of 6s (6 and 5). Challenging seems risky because Player 3 and Player 0's bids suggest they might collectively hold enough 6s (e.g., if Player 3 has 3 and Player 0 has 3, with my 1, the total is already 7). Making a higher bid seems safer. The minimum possible higher bid is 7 7s. I have one 7 in my hand, which provides minimal support but is consistent with the average distribution. Bidding 7 7s shifts the pressure to Player 2 without making an excessively bold claim compared to challenging.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 75842576, which contains three 7s. The current bid is 7 7s. There are 32 digits in play, and I know 3 of the 7s are in my hand. For the current bid to be valid, there need to be 4 more 7s among the other 24 digits (distributed among 3 players). The expected number of 7s in 24 random digits is about 2.4, making 7 7s a high and risky bid. It is statistically unlikely that there are 7 or more 7s in total. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move.

Player 2 Reasoning: As the first bidder in a new round with 24 digits total, I want to start with a reasonable but not too revealing opening bid. My hand is 75842576, which contains two 7s, two 5s, two 6s, one 8, and one 4. Historically, higher digits like 6s and 7s have attracted aggressive bidding, but I want to keep my options open. A safe, standard opening is '2 [digit]s'. I'll choose 7s since I have two of them, making it more likely the total count is at least two.

However, bidding 3 7s is risky because it might not be true. Instead, I can bid 2 8s, which is a higher bid and more likely to be true since I have one 8 in my hand and there are still many digits remaining. Challenging is also an option, but bidding 2 8s is a safer and more strategic move.

Given the limited number of total digits (24) and only three players remaining, a bid of 2 8s seems plausible, but not overwhelmingly so. I will attempt a slightly higher bid, increasing the digit to 9. I have no 9s, but it's a reasonable bluff given the current state of the game.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. In my hand (75842576), I have three 7s (positions 1, 7, and 8).

Challenging would be risky because it's plausible for there to be at least 3 7s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the digit to 8 (same quantity), or increase the quantity. I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding 3 8s is reasonable and keeps the pressure on the next player.
