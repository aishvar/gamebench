Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s, two 5s, and one of 2, 7, 8, and 9. The current bid is 1 0s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits in total. A bid of 1 0s is very low. I have two 0s myself, so I know there are at least two 0s in play. Bidding 2 0s is a safe and higher bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 6, 5, 5, 0, 9, 1, 9, 6. I have at least one 0, but only one. The current bid is 2 0s, which I believe is close to the actual count, considering the total digits in play (48). Bidding higher on 0s seems unlikely because I only have one 0, and the total count across all players is probably around 2 or 3 at most. Challenging the current bid seems safer, as the likelihood of there being at least 2 0s is high, so I will challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 4 0s is a safe increase. It's a relatively small increase and doesn't rely on me knowing the exact number of 0s in other players' hands, just that there are at least 4 in total.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 zeros. I have three zeros in my hand (positions 1, 7, and 8). With 5 players each having 8 digits, there are 40 digits total. Having at least 4 zeros is very plausible given my hand already has 3 zeros. To increase the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. I choose to raise the quantity to 5 zeros, which is a reasonable and safe next bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '5 0s' and my hand '87773649', which does not contain any 0s, I must decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Since my hand lacks 0s, I have no direct insight into the likelihood of the current bid being true or false based on my own digits. However, considering the bidding history, the bids have been increasing in quantity for the digit 0. To make a higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or change the digit to a higher one. Given that I have no 0s and thus no direct evidence to challenge the bid effectively, and considering the rules that allow for bidding on any digit, I will consider making a bid on a different digit that I have more information about or seems plausible based on the game's progression. Since I have multiple 7s and 6s, and given that the game has only progressed on bids for 0s so far, I might consider bidding on one of these digits to introduce a new element into the game and potentially gain an advantage by moving the focus away from 0s. However, without knowing the distribution of other digits among players, any bid carries risk. Given these considerations, challenging seems risky without more insight into the distribution of 0s, and bidding on a different digit might be a strategic move to shift the game's focus and potentially uncover more information about the other players' hands.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 7 7s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. A bid of 7 7s is quite high, especially since I only have one 7 and the previous bids focused on 0s. While it's possible others have multiple 7s, the probability feels low enough to challenge, especially considering the jump from 6 7s to 7 7s.

Player 1 Reasoning: I am the first to bid. I have two 0s, two 5s, one 8, one 9, one 7, and one 2. A conservative starting bid is usually based on the most frequent digit in your hand, assuming other players have a similar distribution. I have two 0s and two 5s. Bidding 2 0s is a low starting point. Bidding 3 0s is more aggressive but still reasonable with 4 players. I'll start with a conservative bid based on my most frequent digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have two 0s in my hand (positions 1 and 7). Since there are 4 players each with 8 digits, there are 32 digits total. Having at least 4 zeros is quite plausible. I will raise the bid to 4 0s, which is a higher quantity than the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 0s' and looking at my hand '87773649', I notice I don't have any 0s. However, considering the bidding history, the bids have been increasing in quantity for the digit 0. Since my hand doesn't provide any direct insight into the likelihood of the current bid being true or false, I must consider the overall probability and the potential for other players to have 0s. Given that we are already at a bid of '4 0s' and considering the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32, it seems plausible that there could be at least 4 zeros among all players, especially since the game has just started and players are likely to have diverse digits. However, without more information or a clear indication that the bid is unlikely, making a higher bid seems like a reasonable strategy. Since I have multiple 7s and 6s in my hand, and given that the current bid is for 0s, I could try to bid on a higher digit or increase the quantity. But, increasing the quantity for 0s might not be the best strategy without having any 0s in my hand. Thus, considering a bid that increases either the quantity or the digit seems wise. Given the presence of my digits, bidding on a digit I have more of, like 7s, could be a good move, but it should be higher than the current bid in terms of the game's rules. Therefore, a bid of '4 7s' could be seen as a strategic move, leveraging the digits I have while also considering the game's progression and the need to make a higher bid than '4 0s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one 7. The current bid is 4 7s. With 4 players and 8 digits each, there are 32 total digits.  A bid of 4 7s implies a significant concentration of 7s among the other players. While possible, it's a relatively high bid given the number of players.  Looking at my hand, I have two 0s and two 5s. Bidding on 0s or 5s would require a significant jump in quantity from the previous bid of 4 7s.  Challenging the 4 7s seems like a reasonable move as it's not a certainty that there are that many 7s in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the bidding and there are no previous bids to consider, I should look at my hand to determine a reasonable starting bid. My hand contains 87773649, which has two 7s and no other repeating digits more than once. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and we have 3 players, a safe starting bid considering my hand would be to bid on a digit I have, aiming not to overbid. Bidding on the 7s seems like a good starting point because I have two of them, and it's a moderate digit, not too high or too low.

Player 5 Reasoning: Given that there are no previous bids and I have a hand with repeated digits, I can start by bidding on a digit I have the most of. In my hand, 7 appears twice and so does 8 and 6 appears once and the rest are singles. Since I have two 7s and two 8s, bidding on one of these seems like a safe start. Considering the goal is to make a valid higher bid than 'None', starting with a low quantity and a digit I have multiple of is reasonable. Let's choose the higher of the repeated digits to bid on, which would be 8 since it's higher than 7.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. In my hand, I have two 8s (positions 1 and 7). This means there are at least 2 eights already in my hand alone, so the bid is plausible. To raise the bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since 2 9s would be a valid higher bid and I have no 9s, bidding 3 0s is a good option because I have two 0s in my hand and increasing the quantity to 3 makes the bid stronger and believable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 0s' and looking at my hand '87773649', I notice I don't have any zeros. However, considering the bid history and the fact that I have multiple occurrences of the digit '7' and other digits, I should think about making a bid that is reasonably higher than '3 0s'. Since I have two '7s' in my hand and considering the total possible occurrences across both players' hands, bidding on a higher digit or increasing the quantity seems like a viable strategy. Given that my hand contains two '7s' and no '0s', and aiming to increase the bid while being mindful of the potential distribution of digits, I could consider bidding on a digit I have, like '7', or aim for a slightly higher quantity on a digit that might be more common, like '6' or '7'. However, without specific knowledge of the other player's hand, I must balance between making a bid that is likely to be true and one that challenges the current state effectively. Since '3 0s' is a relatively low bid and I have no '0s', increasing the quantity or moving to a higher digit seems reasonable. Considering I have two '7s', a bid of '4 7s' could be a strategic move, assuming the distribution of '7s' might be favorable across both hands.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s, meaning at least four 7s exist across both players' hands. I have no 7s in my hand, so all four or more 7s must be in the opponent's hand, which is unlikely given each hand has only 8 digits. Additionally, the maximum quantity is 16, so 4 is not an extreme bid, but without any 7s myself, this bid seems risky to accept. I will challenge to test the validity of this bid.
