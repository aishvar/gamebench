Player 1 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round. I have three 9s in my hand (43758999). With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. A bid of 3 9s is a safe starting bid based on my hand, representing a concentration of 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, and the expected number of 9s across all 40 digits is 4. Since the current bid of 3 9s is likely true (with 4 being the average), challenging would be risky. I should raise the bid with a digit I have multiple of. I have two 3s and two 8s, so bidding 4 of either would align with their expected total counts. Choosing 3s as a lower digit with a reasonable spread.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s, which is the expected count for a digit with 40 total digits. I have zero 3s in my hand, making the bid slightly less likely from my perspective, but it's still plausible. My hand contains four 1s, making 1s my strongest digit. Bidding on 1s is a good strategy. Bidding 5 1s is a valid bid as it has a higher quantity (5) than the current bid (4). With four 1s in my hand, I only need one more 1 among the remaining 32 digits held by the other four players for the bid to be true, which is a very likely scenario. This is a strong and safe bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 65912936, which contains one 1. The current bid is 5 1s by Player 3. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, an average of 4 ones across all hands would be reasonable (since each digit 0-9 should appear roughly 4 times on average). Given that I only have one 1, it’s possible but not highly likely that there are 4 more 1s in the other 32 digits. However, I’ll assume the bid might be a bluff. Still, to play conservatively and avoid an early challenge, I’ll make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 5 6s keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, which is a valid higher bid and aligns with my hand strength for 6s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 4. I have two 6s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 7s or higher digits in my hand, I will increase the quantity. Bidding 6 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:3 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4.8 (40 / 10 digits). A bid of 6 6s is slightly above average, but not excessively so. However, the previous bids have been increasing steadily. Given my hand and the escalating bids, challenging seems risky as the bid of 6 6s is plausible. I need to make a higher bid. I have three 9s in my hand. Bidding 7 9s is a significant jump in both quantity and digit, based on my strong holding of 9s and the need to raise the bid significantly.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid of 7 9s requires at least 7 nines across all 40 digits. With only one 9 in my hand, the expected total nines is around 4 (based on uniform probability). Given that Player 1's bid exceeds this expectation and there's no indication of coordinated nines in other bids, challenging is statistically favorable. The risk of elimination is offset by the low likelihood of the bid being valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have four 9s in my hand (three 9s, one 9). With 32 total digits among 4 players, an average digit count is 3.2. Having four 9s is significantly above average. Since I am the first to bid and the current bid is None, I can start with a bid reflecting my strong hand in 9s. Bidding 5 9s is a reasonable starting point, slightly above my personal count but plausible given the remaining digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s made by Player 1. Player 1 successfully bid 7 9s in the previous round, suggesting they might have a strong hand of 9s again, making a challenge risky. My hand is 11212179, containing four 1s. With 4 players and 32 total digits, the expected count of any digit is 3.2. My four 1s mean the remaining 24 digits have an expected 2.4 1s, for a total expected count of 6.4. Bidding 7 1s is a valid higher bid (quantity 7 > quantity 5) and is a plausible count slightly above the expected total, leveraging the strength of my hand.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:1 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 65912936, which contains one 1. The current bid is 7 1s by Player 3. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 7 1s means that there should be at least 6 more 1s in the other players' hands. Given that each player has 8 digits, it's possible but not extremely likely, as it would require an average of 2 1s per other player. However, since I only have one 1, I don't have strong evidence to challenge. Bidding higher, I can go to 8 1s or switch to a lower quantity with a higher digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s and two 9s, so bidding on 6s or 9s could be safer. I’ll bid 8 6s, as it’s a higher bid and aligns with my hand strength, increasing the quantity significantly while leveraging my two 6s.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s made by Player 4. I have one 6 in my hand. Given that there are 3 other active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total possible count for any digit is 32. Bidding a higher quantity or digit seems risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding 9 6s or higher would be a possibility if I think the current bid is likely to be false. Since I have a 6 and the bid is 8 6s, I should consider if challenging is more beneficial. But first, let's evaluate bidding. I could bid 9 6s, but that seems aggressive. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have two 0s, and bidding on 0s could be strategic. The maximum possible for any digit is 32, and with 4 players, it's feasible. I should challenge if I think the bid is unlikely.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my turn as Player 5. I have the hand '03646720'. I should look for a digit that could reasonably be bid given my hand and the total digits remaining. I have two 6s, which is a good starting point. Since there are 24 total digits and 3 players, bidding on a digit that could feasibly add up seems necessary. Given that I have two 6s, bidding '3 6s' seems like a reasonable and low-risk start.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. With 24 total digits among 3 players, the average count of any digit is 2.4. A bid of 3 6s is slightly above average but plausible. Given my single 6 and the history of aggressive bidding, challenging seems risky. I should make a higher bid based on my hand. I have three 9s, which is a strong hand for that digit. Bidding 4 9s is a logical step up from 3 6s, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains four 1s. The current bid is 4 9s. With 24 total digits among 3 players, the average count for any digit is 2.4. A bid of 4 9s is slightly above average. Based on my strong hand in 1s, I can make a plausible bid higher than 4 9s. Bidding 5 1s is very safe (need only one more 1 from 16 digits). Bidding 6 1s is also likely (need two more 1s from 16 digits). Bidding 6 1s is a stronger bid than 5 1s and is well above the current bid of 4 9s (higher quantity). Challenging 4 9s is risky, especially considering Player 1's history with 9s in the previous round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits: 03646720. I see one 1 and two 6s in my hand. Given that there are 24 total digits remaining and 3 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. The bid of 6 1s seems high but possible. However, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains two 6s and one 1, bidding a higher quantity of a digit I have seems reasonable. I will bid 7 6s as it is a higher quantity than 6 1s and aligns with the digits in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the average count of any digit is 2.4. A bid of 7 6s seems high, as it implies at least 6 more 6s are held by the other two players. However, Player 5 has been bidding 6s aggressively this round. Challenging here is risky if Player 5 does indeed have a significant number of 6s. Looking at my hand, I have three 9s. I previously bid 4 9s and 7 9s and won a challenge on 7 9s. While 7 9s is a high bid, the previous win on 7 9s suggests there might be a concentration of 9s among the remaining players. Bidding 8 9s is a significant jump but leverages my strong hand in 9s and is a plausible increase over 7 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 9s on a total of 24 digits. This is a very high bid, significantly exceeding the average expected count for any digit (2.4). While Player 1 has previously bid on 9s, a bid of 8 is statistically unlikely to be true. My hand contains only one 9, meaning the other two players would need at least 7 more 9s between their 16 digits for the bid to be true. This has a low probability. My hand does not support making a higher bid (9 or more of any digit) with any confidence. Therefore, challenging the highly improbable bid is the most strategic move.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have four 1s in my hand (11212179). There are a total of 16 digits between the two players. As the first bidder, I need to make a valid bid. Bidding based on my strongest digit (1s) is a good strategy. I have four 1s. Bidding 6 1s requires the other player (Player 5) to have at least two 1s among their 8 digits. Given the distribution of digits, there's a reasonable probability (around 71.6%) that Player 5 has two or more 1s. This is a strong opening bid that leverages my hand's composition.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s made by Player 3. I have two 6s and one 1 in my hand. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. The bid of 6 1s seems plausible but I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be a bluff. Since my goal is to either make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should assess the likelihood of there being more than 6 1s. With 16 total digits and only 2 players, if I have one 1, there must be 15 other digits. I should consider bidding higher or challenging based on my hand and the total digits remaining.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s made by Player 5. There are 16 total digits remaining (8 in my hand, 8 in Player 5's hand). My hand (11212179) contains zero 6s. For Player 5's bid of 7 6s to be true, Player 5 must hold at least 7 6s in their hand of 8 digits. This is an extremely improbable occurrence under standard assumptions of digit distribution. While I could make a higher bid based on my hand (e.g., 8 1s, as I have four 1s), challenging the current bid exploits its high unlikelihood. The probability of Player 5 having 7 or more 6s out of 8 digits is very low, making a challenge the most strategic move.
