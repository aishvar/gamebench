Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since I'm the first to bid, I need to make a strategic opening bid. Looking at my hand (18923910), I have one 1, one 8, one 9, one 2, one 3, one 9, one 1, and one 0. I have two 1s and two 9s, which is a good starting point. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. A conservative estimate would be that each digit appears about 4.8 times on average (48 total digits ÷ 10 possible values). Since I already have two 1s, it's reasonable to estimate there might be around 5-7 total 1s among all players. I'll start with a modest bid of 5 1s, which is likely to be true based on probability while not being too aggressive.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s made by Player 0. I have one 1 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have many high digits, bidding a slightly higher quantity with a higher digit seems reasonable. I will bid 6 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. My hand contains three 0s (60403950). With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average expected count for any digit is 4.8. The current bid of 6 2s is slightly above average. I have zero 2s, which makes challenging a possibility, but 6 is not an extremely high bid. Based on my hand, I have three 0s. Bidding 7 0s would mean I expect at least four more 0s among the other 5 players (40 digits). The expected number of 0s in the other hands is 40 / 10 = 4. Therefore, bidding 7 0s is a bid exactly at the expected value based on my hand, making it a solid and supportable bid that is higher than 6 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. To reach 7 2s total there must be at least four among the other 46 cards, and the expected number of 2s there is 4.6, making this bid plausible. Challenging 7 0s has under a 50% chance of success, so I should raise.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 7 2s and my hand of 61494763, which contains one 2 and other digits, I need to assess the likelihood of higher bids. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48 and we are already at a bid of 7 for the digit 2, increasing the quantity further might be risky. However, considering the distribution of digits and the fact that I have a diverse set of digits, I could attempt to increase the digit value while keeping the quantity the same or slightly increasing it. Given that my hand does not offer a clear advantage for bidding higher on the digit 2, and considering the potential distribution of other digits among players, a reasonable strategy could be to challenge the current bid if it seems unlikely or to bid on a different digit if I have sufficient information to do so. Since I have one 6 in my hand and no clear indication that the digit 2 is overly abundant, challenging the current bid of 7 2s seems like a viable option, especially considering that the bid is already quite high and the total number of digits is limited.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits and an expected 3.2 twos among them, there's over a 97% chance at least one more 2 exists. Opening with 4 2s is a safe yet assertive bid to start the round.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. The current bid is 4 2s, so increasing the quantity to 5 2s is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 2s and the possibility that other players also hold 2s, making 5 2s a reasonable next step.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 2/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (18923910), I have one 2. The current bid by Player 5 is 5 2s. In the previous round, there were 7 2s total when Player 3 bid 7 2s and Player 4 challenged and lost. Now we have one fewer player (Player 4), who might have had some 2s. Player 3 bid 4 2s this round, suggesting they have at least some 2s. Given that I have one 2, and Player 5 increased the bid to 5 2s, it seems plausible that there are at least 5 2s total. I could bid 5 3s (same quantity, higher digit) or 6 0s/1s (higher quantity). Since I have one 0, one 1, and one 9 in my hand, I'll bid 5 3s to stay conservative with the quantity while moving to a higher digit.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s made by Player 0. I have 8 secret digits: 87116527. I see that I have one 3 in my hand. Considering the total digits remaining is 40 and there are 5 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Given that the current bid is 5 3s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. I can see that bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit could be strategic. Since I have one 3, and assuming others might have a few as well, bidding a higher digit seems reasonable. I have two 7s in my hand, and bidding on 7s could be strategic. However, I should also consider the likelihood of other players having multiple 3s or higher digits. Bidding 6 2s seems reasonable as it's higher than 5 3s in terms of quantity and I have a 2 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. There are 5 players with 8 digits each, totaling 40 digits. The average expected count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. A bid of 6 is significantly above this average. My hand (60403950) contains zero 2s. This means that for the bid of 6 2s to be true, the other 4 players (with a total of 32 digits) must collectively hold at least six 2s. The expected number of 2s among the other 4 players is 32 * 0.1 = 3.2. It is statistically unlikely for 4 players to hold 6 or more of a specific digit when the expectation is only 3.2. Given that I have no 2s to contribute, challenging this bid is a favorable move.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current round has just started with 4 active players: Player 0, Player 1, Player 3, and Player 5. The total number of digits remaining is 32. My hand is 87116527. I see that I have 2 1s, 1 2, 1 3, 1 5, 1 6, 1 7, and 1 8. No bids have been made yet in this round. Since the current bid is 'None', I can make any initial bid. I will start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have 2 1s, so bidding '2 1s' seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have two 2s in my hand, and with three other players holding 24 digits, the total count of 2s could be as low as 2 (if others have none). Challenging this bid risks losing if the actual count is 3 or more, but given the low quantity and my own 2s, it's a plausible gamble to test the validity of the bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. There are 16 unknown digits among the other two players, with an expected 1.6 additional 2s. Bidding 4 2s requires only one more in the unknown cards and has roughly an 82% chance of being correct. This is a strong yet safe opening bid above None.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the likelihood of there being at least 4 2s among all players. In my own hand (18923910), I have 0 2s. There are 3 active players with 8 digits each, for a total of 24 digits. Player 3 has bid 4 2s. From the game history, I can see that in previous rounds when players bid on 2s, the actual count was higher than expected (7 2s in both earlier challenges). This suggests Player 3 might have several 2s in their hand. Even though I have none, it's quite possible that between Player 1 and Player 3, there are at least 4 2s. I'll make a higher bid rather than challenge. I have one 3 in my hand, so I'll bid on 3s with a slightly higher quantity.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s made by Player 0. I have the hand 87116527, which contains two 3s. Given that there are only 24 digits in total and three players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. The bid of 5 3s seems plausible but I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be a lie. My hand has two 3s, and if the other players have a reasonable distribution, this bid could be close to the truth. However, I can make a bid of 6 3s, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have only one 3 in my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (18923910), I have one 2. Player 3 has bid 3 2s, meaning they're claiming there are at least 3 twos between our combined hands. Since I have 1 two, that would mean Player 3 has at least 2 twos in their hand. This is certainly possible. From the game history, I can see that 2s have been relatively common. In the previous rounds, the actual count of 2s was 7 when challenged. While the player count has decreased, it's still reasonable that Player 3 could have 2 or more 2s. I could bid 3 3s since I have two 3s in my hand, which would be a higher bid (same quantity but higher digit). This seems like a safe move based on my hand composition.
