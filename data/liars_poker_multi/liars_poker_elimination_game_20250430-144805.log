Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', which means I can make any valid bid as my bid must be strictly higher than the current bid. I have 8 digits in my hand: 8, 2, 3, 8, 1, 4, 1, 5. I see that I have two 8s, and there are 6 players with 8 digits each, making a total of 48 digits. A reasonable starting bid could be based on the highest digit I have, which is 8. Since I have two 8s, bidding '2 8s' seems like a good starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. Bidding higher than 2 8s is possible. I have two 7s, so I could bid 3 7s. However, since I have no 8s, it's likely no one else does either, making 2 8s a potentially weak bid. I will challenge to see if Player 0 is bluffing.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', which means I can make any initial bid. I have the digits 8, 2, 3, 8, 1, 4, 1, 5 in my hand. The digit '8' appears twice, so bidding '2 8s' seems reasonable and is a good starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4.  Player 0's bid of 2 8s is lower than the average, which isn't inherently suspicious, but I have no 8s to support a higher bid of 8s.  I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 3s, 4s, or 6s. I have two 3s, two 4s, and two 6s. Bidding 3 of any of these seems reasonable and a safe increase from 2 8s. Bidding 3 3s is the lowest valid bid I can make based on my hand and the current bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s. Bidding 3 6s is a valid higher bid since it maintains the same quantity (3) but increases the digit (6 > 3), leveraging my existing 6s while avoiding overcommitting to a higher quantity.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have 4 and 9 in my hand, neither of which are 6s. Player 3 bid 3 6s. Bidding 4 9s seems reasonable, increasing quantity and digit based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, which means at least four 9s exist among all 40 digits. I have no 9s in my hand, and 9 is a relatively rare digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 would be a big jump and risky. However, I can raise the digit while keeping the quantity at 4. The next higher digit after 9 is not possible, so I must increase the quantity to 5 and choose the lowest digit, which is 0. I have one 8 and one 7, but no 9s or 0s. Bidding 5 0s is plausible since zeros are common, and the bid is valid and higher than 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s made by Player 5. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than 5 0s. I have the digits 8, 2, 3, 8, 1, 4, 1, 5 in my hand. I can see that bidding a high quantity might be risky given the total digits remaining (40) and the number of players (5). However, I can try to bid a higher digit with a reasonable quantity. I notice my hand contains two 8s, and I can try to leverage this. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as it's higher than 5 0s in terms of digit value and I have two 8s in my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s made by Player 5. I have 8 zeros are not present but I have one 8 and other digits in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains an 8, bidding a higher digit seems reasonable. I will bid 3 8s, increasing both the quantity from the previous relevant bid and the digit.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s made by Player 5. I have 8 secret digits: 8, 2, 3, 8, 1, 4, 1, 5. I see that I have two 8s and my goal is to make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 5 0s, I need to bid higher than 5 or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. I notice I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid of 5 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round. I have two 3s, two 6s, and two 4s in my hand. A safe opening bid is usually based on your strongest digit(s) and considering the number of players. With 4 players and 32 total digits, the average count for any digit is 3.2. Bidding 3 of a digit I have at least two of is a reasonable starting point.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid than the current 3 3s, as it maintains the same quantity but increases the digit. This leverages my hand's strength in 9s without overreaching.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have 9 in my hand, which is a strong indication that I can make a higher bid. Since the maximum possible quantity is 32, I can safely increase the quantity to 4, making my bid 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I must bid higher either by increasing the quantity or the digit. I have one 8 and one 7 in my hand but no 9s. Increasing the quantity to 5 is a big jump and might be risky. Instead, I can raise the digit to 0s at the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. I have one 8 and one 7, so bidding 4 0s might be a reasonable next step. However, since the current bid is 4 9s, the next higher digit at the same quantity is 0s, which is allowed. I will bid 4 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 2/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, which is not very strong support for increasing the count of 9s. The bid is already at a relatively high quantity for a single digit, and increasing the quantity further would be risky. I also have multiple 7s, which could be a safer digit to bid on. The next valid higher bid after 4 9s must be at least 5 0s or 4 0s, but 5 0s is a big jump and I have only one 0. Instead of bidding, challenging seems reasonable since 4 9s might be a stretch given the total digits and my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current game state is at 24 total digits remaining. I have the digits 4, 9, 2, 3, 8, and 5 in my hand. Since no one has bid yet, I can make a strategic bid to start the round. Given the digits in my hand, I can confidently bid 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. With 24 total digits across 3 players, the expected number of any single digit is around 2.4 (24 / 10). A bid of 4 9s is significantly higher than the expected value, especially since I know I have none. While it's possible the other two players have four or more 9s between them, it's unlikely enough to warrant a challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have 2 4s and 2 9s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start by making a bid. I'll choose a digit that I'm most confident about, which is 9, and a quantity that's higher than any previous bid. I'll bid 3 9s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand contains three 9s, and the total digits remaining are 16. To make a valid higher bid, I need to increase the quantity or the digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, increasing the quantity to 4 9s is the only valid option. Challenging would be risky because my hand alone has three 9s, making the bid likely valid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 3. I have a 9 in my hand and one other 9 in my hand is not visible to me. Given that I have at least two 9s, bidding 5 9s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. My hand contains 3 9s. Since there are 16 digits total, Player 4 could have 2 more 9s to meet the bid, but it's uncertain. However, challenging the bid is a high-risk, high-reward move. If the actual count of 9s is less than 5 (which is possible if Player 4 has fewer 9s), I win. Given the uncertainty and the potential for a bluff, challenging is a strategic choice.
