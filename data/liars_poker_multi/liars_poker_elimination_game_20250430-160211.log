Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have 8 digits in my hand: 28783188. Looking at the frequency: two 8s, two 3s, one 7, one 2, one 1. Since I'm the first bidder and have two 8s, it's reasonable to start with a conservative bid of 3 8s, assuming other players likely have at least one more 8 among them.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s by Player 0. I have two 2s in my hand. Bidding 4 2s is a valid higher bid because it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I am not confident enough to challenge the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (44924829), I have two 2s. Player 1 has bid 4 2s, meaning they believe there are at least 4 twos among all players. Since I already have 2 of them in my hand, this seems like a reasonable bid. I could challenge, but with 6 players and 8 digits each, there's a good chance that at least 2 more 2s exist among the other 5 players. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have three 4s in my hand, so I'm confident bidding 5 4s - increasing both the quantity and the digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I hold two 7s, so if I bid 5 7s I only need three more 7s among the other 40 unknown digits. That has roughly a 78% chance of being true, making it a reasonable raise rather than a risky challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, making the total count of 7s potentially around the expected average of 4.8. However, challenging risks elimination if the count meets or exceeds 5. Instead, bidding 6 3s leverages my two 3s and follows the trend of increasing quantity, which could be plausible given the distribution across other players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s, which means at least six 3s are claimed across all players' hands. I have one '3' in my hand (09676185), so I know at least one 3 exists. The bid has increased in quantity from previous bids, indicating growing confidence. To make a valid higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep quantity at 6 and increase the digit. Since 6 is already a moderately high quantity and I have no additional 3s to support a higher quantity bid of 7, I can instead bid 6 4s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have one '4' in my hand, which supports this bid somewhat. This is a reasonable and valid bid that challenges the previous bid without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 4s in my hand, and the current bid claims there are 6 fours among all players. With 6 players and 8 digits each, this is possible but getting high. Looking at my hand (28783188), I have three 8s. Since I know there are at least 3 eights (I can see them), and 8 is a higher digit than 4, I can safely bid '6 8s'. This maintains the same quantity but increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 7 7s is a reasonable move, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '7 7s' made by Player 1. Looking at my hand (44924829), I have zero 7s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For the bid of '7 7s' to be valid, there need to be at least 7 sevens among all players. Since I have none, all 7 would need to come from the other 5 players who have 40 digits total. This is possible but seems somewhat high given the distribution. Player 3 previously bid '5 7s', suggesting they might have some 7s in their hand. Player 1 increased this to '7 7s', which could indicate they have additional 7s or are bluffing. Given that I need to either challenge or make a higher bid, I'll bid '7 8s', which is higher than '7 7s' because it's the same quantity but a higher digit. This is reasonable since I have two 8s in my hand, contributing to the total count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have only one 8. There are 47 unknown digits, so I expect about 4.7 more 8s, making it unlikely there are at least six others needed for 7 total (probability around 35%). The current bid of 7 8s is improbable, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (44924829), I have two 4s, two 2s, one 9, one 8, and two 9s. Since I have two 4s in my hand, and there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total digits), I can reasonably expect there to be more 4s among other players. A conservative opening bid would be around 5-6 of a digit I have in my hand. I'll bid 5 4s since I already have 2 of them, meaning I only need 3 more across all other players, which is quite likely given there are 32 more digits among other players. This is a safe opening bid that gives me room to maneuver later.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have zero 4s in my hand, which suggests other players might have fewer than expected. With 40 total digits and an estimated average of ~3.2 4s across the other 4 players, the bid of 5 4s seems unlikely. Even if Player 2 has 2-3 4s, the total may still fall short. Challenging this bid is statistically favorable.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Starting the round with a bid of 4 6s leverages my knowledge of my own hand and assumes a moderate spread of 6s among remaining players. This bid is plausible and creates a strong opening position.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. With 32 digits total and considering distribution, bidding 4 7s is a safe increase but may be risky given only one 6 in my hand. Instead, I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is allowed. I do not have any 7s, so bidding 4 7s is plausible. This is a valid higher bid and keeps pressure on others.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 28783188, I have two 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, meaning there need to be at least 2 more 7s among the other three players' hands to make this bid valid. Given that 7s have appeared frequently in previous bidding and Player 3 was eliminated after a successful 7 8s bid (which proved there were 7 8s total), it's reasonable to assume there are at least 4 7s total. Making a higher bid would be risky as I'd need to bid either 5 of something (which I don't have strong evidence for) or 4 of a higher digit (I have three 8s, but 8s have already been proven numerous in earlier rounds). The current bid of 4 7s seems plausible, so I'll make a conservative bid of 4 8s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 5s in my hand. Given the bidding history, it's likely that there are at least 4 5s across all hands. Bidding 5 5s is a reasonable move, increasing the quantity and digit slightly.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. With 32 total digits remaining and no 5s in my hand (Player 4), the expected number of 5s across the remaining 24 digits (Players 0, 1, 5) is ~2.4. Since the bid requires at least 5 5s, which is significantly higher than the expected value, challenging is statistically favorable. Player 1’s bid likely overstates the actual count.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With 24 total digits across three players, bidding 4 6s accounts for my own digits and a conservative estimate of others' holdings. This follows a similar strategy to my previous bid of 4 6s in the last 3-player round, leveraging the higher digit value to create a challenging bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Given there are 24 digits total and 3 players, having at least 4 sixes is plausible but not certain. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. I have one 7 in my hand, so bidding 4 7s is reasonable and still conservative. It challenges the previous bid while not being overly aggressive.

Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 28783188, I have one 7. The current bid is 4 7s. With 3 players remaining and 24 total digits, for there to be 4 7s, the other two players would need to have 3 more 7s between them. While possible, this seems unlikely given the previous bidding patterns. Also, Player 5 jumped to 7s right after Player 4's 6s bid, which could be a bluff. Based on my single 7 and the probability analysis, I should challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have 8 digits in my hand (28783188) which contains: three 8s, two 7s, one 2, one 1, and one 3. Since I'm starting the bidding in a fresh round with just two players total (16 digits), I should make a conservative opening bid based on what I know I have. Starting with '3 8s' is safe since I can see three 8s in my own hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s, but I have no 8s in my hand (06963273). This means all 8s in the game must be in Player 0's hand. Given that Player 0 has 8 digits, the probability of them holding at least 3 8s seems low, especially since higher counts (e.g., 3+) become increasingly unlikely in a random distribution. Challenging avoids the risk of making a bid that could be invalidated, particularly since Player 0's bid relies entirely on their own hand. The lack of 8s in my hand makes this challenge strategically favorable.
