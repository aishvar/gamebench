Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand (at position 7), so I know there's at least that many. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there's likely to be more 0s in play. Since the current bid is very low (1 0s), I can safely bid higher. A conservative increase would be to bid 2 0s, which I'm confident exists given my own hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 2 7s keeps the quantity at 2 while raising the digit above 0, and is guaranteed true given my hand, so it’s unlikely anyone will challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. My hand is 95019166, which contains two 6s. Bidding 3 6s is a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity from 2 to 3. This bid is supported by my hand, making it a reasonable and relatively safe move compared to challenging the previous bid or bidding on a digit I don't have.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 3s and two 5s in my hand.  With 6 players and 48 total digits, a bid of 3 6s is plausible, but not overwhelmingly likely. Given my hand, I can make a higher bid that I feel more confident about. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have no 7s, but Player 2 previously bid 2 7s, suggesting there are at least two 7s out there, making 3 7s a reasonable next bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which means Player 4 believes there are at least 3 sevens among all players. With 6 players having 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. If the digits were evenly distributed, we'd expect about 4-5 of each digit. Since I have one 7, there need to be at least 2 more 7s among the other players for the bid to be valid. This seems reasonable. I could challenge, but the bid isn't high enough to be suspicious. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, but that's not relevant for bidding 7s or 8s. I'll bid 4 7s, increasing the quantity while keeping the same digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of this round. Looking at my hand, I have one 7, one 8, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 9, and two 6s. Since I have two 6s in my hand, that's a good starting point. In the previous round, my bid of 4 7s was successful (there were actually 5 7s total), which suggests players have various digits. A conservative opening bid would be to claim 3 6s since I already have 2 in my hand, meaning I only need one more 6 among the other 32 digits held by other players, which is quite likely. This is a safe opening bid that has a good chance of being true while not revealing too much information about my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 49795045, I have zero 6s. The current bid of '3 6s' was made by Player 5. Given there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total), and I know I have no 6s, there would need to be at least 3 6s among the other 32 digits (4 players × 8 digits). While this is possible, the previous round revealed there were 5 7s in play when Player 0 was eliminated, suggesting a somewhat random distribution. Additionally, Player 5 started with a relatively conservative bid this round, which might indicate uncertainty. I'll challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (66954837), I have two 6s, which is a good starting point. Since there are 4 players with 8 digits each (32 total digits), and I already have 2 sixes, it's reasonable to assume there might be more among the other players. A conservative starting bid would be 3 6s, which means I only need one more 6 from the other 24 digits the other players have. This is a very safe bid based on probability, but still high enough to put some pressure on other players.

Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (66954837), I have two 6s, one 9, one 5, one 4, one 8, one 3, and one 7. This is the start of a new round with 3 players, and I'm the first to bid. I've successfully bid 3 6s in the previous two rounds, which suggests that 6s might be common among other players as well. Since I have two 6s in my hand, bidding 3 6s again would mean I only need one more 6 from the other two players, which seems quite reasonable. This has been a successful strategy for me in previous rounds, so I'll continue with it.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is plausible given I only need one more 9 from the remaining 16 digits held by other players. Challenging seems risky given Player 5's repeated success with the 3 6s bid in previous rounds. Bidding 3 9s is a safer and strategic move based on my hand strength in 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the expected number of any digit is around 2.4 (24 / 10).  Player 3's bid of 3 9s is slightly above average.  Given I have one 9, the other two players would need to have at least two more 9s combined for the bid to be true.  This is plausible. I also have two 3s and two 5s. Bidding 4 of any digit seems too high given the current bid and my hand. Bidding 3 of a higher digit is an option. I have a 9, a 7, a 4, a 1, and two 3s and two 5s. Since the current bid is 3 9s, I need to bid higher. Bidding 4 of a lower digit or 3 of a higher digit are the immediate options.  Challenging 3 9s is risky as it's not an extremely high bid given the number of players and digits. Bidding 4 3s or 4 5s based on my hand is possible, but increasing the quantity significantly might be risky. Bidding 3 of a higher digit than 9 is impossible.  Therefore, increasing the quantity seems like the most viable option. I have two 3s and two 5s, making 4 3s or 4 5s possible bids.  Bidding 4 3s is a valid higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (66954837), I have one 3. Player 4 bid '4 3s', meaning they believe there are at least 4 threes among all players. With 24 total digits and 3 players, each with 8 digits, this is certainly possible. Since I have one 3, there would need to be at least 3 more 3s between the other two players, which is reasonable. I could challenge, but it's risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, which gives me confidence. I'll bid '5 6s', which means I'm claiming there are at least 5 sixes total. Since I already have 2, I'm betting there are at least 3 more between the other players, which is possible but aggressive enough to put pressure on them.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Player 5 has a history of winning challenges on bids involving 6s (actual count 4) and 7s (actual count 5). They just bid 5 6s. My hand has two 6s. While 5 6s is statistically unlikely based on pure probability (requiring 3 more 6s from 16 digits), Player 5's history suggests the actual count of 6s is often high. Challenging 5 6s is risky if the count is 4 or more, which seems plausible given the history. Bidding 6 6s requires 4 more 6s from 16 digits (since I have 2). This is statistically less likely than 5 6s based on pure chance, but it is a plausible escalation if Player 5 holds a significant number of 6s, which their bidding history implies. This move puts pressure back on Player 5 to either bid higher or challenge a quantity that might be true if they are indeed strong in 6s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s by Player 3. My hand is 91547353. I have two 3s and two 5s. Bidding 7 3s or 7 5s would be increasing the quantity significantly based on my hand. Bidding 6 7s or 6 9s is also an option, but I only have one 7 and one 9. Given the current bid is already quite high at 6 6s, and I have two 3s, bidding 7 3s seems like a reasonable increase that I have some basis for in my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (66954837), I have zero 3s. The current bid is 7 3s made by Player 4. With 24 total digits in play and 8 in my hand (none of which are 3s), that means Player 3 and Player 4 would need to have 7 3s between them. Each player has 8 digits, so it's possible but seems unlikely that almost half of their combined digits would be 3s. I have two 6s in my hand, and Player 3 just bid 6 6s, suggesting there are at least 4 more 6s between the other players. I could bid 7 6s, but that's risky. I could also bid 7 4s or higher, but without knowing the distribution, that's also risky. Given that I have zero 3s and the bid is already at 7 3s, challenging seems like the best option.

Player 5 Reasoning: I'm starting this round with Player 3, and I have 8 digits in my hand: 66954837. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s, one 9, one 5, one 4, one 8, one 3, and one 7. Since I'm making the first bid of the round, I want to bid something that I have a good amount of in my hand. With two 6s, that's my most frequent digit, so I'll start with a conservative bid of 3 6s. This is reasonable because I already have 2 in my hand, and Player 3 might have at least one more 6 in their 8 digits. This has worked well for me in previous rounds too, as I've successfully bid 3 6s multiple times.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s by Player 5. My hand contains two 6s, meaning the total count of 6s is at least 2. Player 5's consistent bidding on 6s suggests they likely hold at least one, making the total count of 6s likely 3 or more. Challenging 3 6s is risky, as I would lose if the count is 3 or higher. Therefore, I must bid higher. My hand contains two 9s. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid is plausible as it only requires Player 5 to have one 9 for the total count to reach 3 (my two + their one). This seems like the most reasonable and safest bid based on my hand and the current game state.

Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 3's bid of 3 9s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (66954837), I have 0 nines. Since there are only 16 total digits in play (8 from me and 8 from Player 3), and I know I have 0 nines, Player 3 would need to have at least 3 nines in their hand for their bid to be valid. While this is possible, it's somewhat unlikely that Player 3 would have 3 or more nines in just 8 digits (the probability is relatively low). Additionally, I've noticed that Player 3 has been making relatively conservative bids throughout the game. I could make a higher bid like 4 6s since I have two 6s in my hand, but given the limited information and the fact that challenging incorrectly would eliminate me, I'll make a safer bid of 4 0s. This increases the quantity while choosing a digit I don't have, which means Player 3 would need to have at least 4 zeros to make this valid, which seems unlikely in 8 digits.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. For this bid to be true, Player 5 must hold at least three 0s in their 8 digits. The probability of a player having three or more of a specific digit in 8 digits is low (approximately 4%). The expected number of 0s across 16 total digits is 1.6. A bid of 4 is significantly higher than the expected count. Based on the low probability of Player 5 having the required number of 0s, challenging seems like the best move.
