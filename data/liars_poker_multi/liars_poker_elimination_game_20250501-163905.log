Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 40580334, I have: two 3s, two 4s, one 0, one 5, and one 8. Since I'm opening the bidding, I should start conservatively but with a digit I know exists multiple times. I have two 3s in my hand, so bidding three 3s is reasonable as it only requires one more 3 among the other 40 digits held by other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. With 5 other players, it's possible that there are at least 3 3s in total. However, the current bid is already at 3 3s, and I need to make a higher bid. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 3 9s is a safe increase in digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand, matching the current bid of 3 9s. To raise, I must increase the quantity or digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, I increase the quantity to 4 9s. With 5 other players holding 40 digits, it's plausible there's at least one more 9. Challenging would risk losing immediately, as my hand alone confirms the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, which means at least four 9s exist among all players. I have one 9 in my hand. Since there are 48 digits total, four 9s is plausible. I can increase the bid by quantity or digit. I have two 7s, two 5s, and one 9, so bidding 4 7s is a valid higher bid with a digit I have more of, making it reasonable to increase the bid and pressure the next player.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, and I have one 9 in my hand. Given there are 48 digits total and six players, having at least four 9s is plausible but somewhat high. I can raise the bid to 4 0s, which is a higher digit with the same quantity, and I have one 0 in my hand, making this bid reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 3/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, so there must be at least three more 9s among the other 40 digits. This is plausible but slightly risky. To increase the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. I have one 7 in my hand, which is a higher digit than 9 but the quantity remains the same. However, 7 is lower than 9, so I cannot bid 4 7s. The next valid higher bid after 4 9s would be 5 0s. I do not have any 0s in my hand, but bidding 5 0s is a reasonable move to increase the bid and put pressure on the next player. Challenging now seems premature since 4 9s is not an implausible bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I see 3 eights in my own hand (90878869). To beat the current bid of 5 0s I can keep the quantity at 5 but choose a higher digit. Across the 40 unknown digits the expected number of eights is 4, so I only need 2 of those to make the bid true, which has roughly a 92% chance. Challenging 5 0s would give me only about a 42% chance to win, so raising with a digit I’m strong in is the better move.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:1 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 21635677, which contains no 8s. The current bid is 5 8s by Player 4. With 48 total digits across 6 players, an average of 4.8 occurrences per digit is expected if digits are evenly distributed. A bid of 5 8s is close to this average and plausible, especially since I have none, meaning they could be concentrated elsewhere. Challenging now feels risky without stronger evidence that the bid is too high. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 6 7s feels reasonable—it increases the quantity from 5 to 6 and switches to a digit I have some of. This keeps the game moving and avoids an immediate challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I can see my own hand (40580334) which contains zero 7s. The current bid claims there are at least 6 7s among all 48 digits. While possible, this seems quite high given: 1) I have zero 7s in my hand, 2) the bidding pattern shows players gradually increasing quantities but switching digits, suggesting they're not particularly confident about 7s, and 3) with 6 players having 8 digits each, claiming 6 of any specific digit is a significant portion that requires multiple players to have that digit. Given I know for certain there are 0 out of 8 7s in my hand, the remaining 5 players would need to average more than 1 seven each to make this bid valid, which seems unlikely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have my hand of 40580334 which contains: two 0s, two 3s, one 4, one 5, and one 8. Since I'm starting the bidding in this round, I should make a conservative bid based on what I know for certain. With two 3s in my hand, bidding '3 3s' is relatively safe as I only need one more 3 among the other 32 digits held by other players to make this bid valid. This also gives me room to maneuver as the bidding progresses.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s, which means there needs to be at least two more 3s among the other four players (total of 32 digits). Given that the previous round saw aggressive bidding and a challenge, it's possible that players are overbidding. However, with only one 3 in my hand, it's risky to challenge immediately. I can make a conservative bid by increasing the digit to 4s, which I also have one of, to keep the game going.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:3 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. My hand contains no 4s, but the expected number of 4s in the remaining 32 digits is ~3.2, making the bid plausible. Bidding 3 5s is safer since my hand has one 5, and the expected total 5s would be ~4.2, increasing the likelihood of the bid being valid. Challenging the current bid risks elimination due to its probable validity.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit. Since I only have one 5, bidding 4 5s might be risky. Instead, bidding 3 6s is a safer increment and more believable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I hold three 8s (8,8,8) in my own eight-digit hand. To top the current bid of 3 6s, I can raise the quantity to 4 and choose the digit 8. With 32 unknown digits among the other four players, the expected count of 8s is about 3, so needing just one more 8 in the rest of the deck gives me roughly a 97% chance the bid is true. This is a strong, low-risk raise that keeps pressure on the table.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have zero 8s. The current bid of 4 8s means there need to be at least 4 8s among all players. With 5 active players having 8 digits each (40 total), this is possible but seems unlikely given: 1) I have no 8s, 2) Player 4 increased both quantity and digit significantly, and 3) based on previous bidding behavior, players were being conservative with quantity increases. The jump from 3 to 4 while also choosing a high digit (8) suggests a risky bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I’m the opening bidder this round and hold three 8s (9 0 8 7 8 8 6 9). With 32 total digits in play, the expected number of any single digit is about 3.2. Since I already have 3 of the 8s, it’s very likely (≈92%) that at least one of the remaining 24 unknown digits is also an 8, making a total of 4 or more. Starting with 4 8s gives me a strong, yet believable opening bid that others will find hard to challenge immediately, while still leaving room for future raises.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which means there are at least 3 more 8s among the other three players. Given that the previous round's challenge on 4 8s was successful (actual count was 4), it's possible that the count is still around that number. However, with only 32 digits remaining, the probability of having exactly 4 8s again is uncertain. I could bid higher, but with only one 8 in my hand, it's risky. Challenging seems reasonable given the uncertainty.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s. Bidding 3 1s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This is a safe move since my three 1s ensure the bid is likely true, avoiding a risky challenge.

Since the current quantity is 3, bidding 3 2s is a valid higher bid. I have one '2' in my hand, so bidding 3 2s is reasonable and not overly risky.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Since the bid quantity is 3, the total count of 9s across both hands must be at least 3. Given I have only one 9, Player 2 must have at least two 9s for this bid to be valid. I have more 6s (two) than 9s, but the bid must be strictly higher than 3 9s. The next possible higher bid with the same quantity (3) would be 3 0s, which seems risky. Increasing the quantity to 4 is safer but I have only one of any digit that might reach 4 total. Therefore, the best move is to challenge the bid of 3 9s because it seems unlikely Player 2 has two or more 9s.
