Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have the digits 6, 7, 0, 4, 5, 3, 4, 7 in my hand. The most frequent digit I have is 7, appearing twice. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each, the total digits are 48. Starting the bidding with a reasonable low quantity and a digit I have some confidence in is best. I will start with '2 7s' because I have two 7s, making it likely that at least two 7s exist overall.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. I could bid 3 0s, which is a safe but potentially weak move. I could also challenge, but with 6 players, 2 7s is not an unreasonable bid. I will bid 3 0s to stay in the game and see how the bidding progresses.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s, which means there needs to be at least two more 0s among the other five players' hands (total of 40 digits). Given the low probability of having two more 0s in the remaining digits, it's unlikely the bid is valid. I should challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 3 0s is a logical next step, increasing the quantity while staying within a reasonable range given the previous challenge outcome and the remaining digits. It's a relatively safe bid that I can support with my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I hold three 5s and zero 0s. Challenging 3 0s is risky because 3 zeros among 40 digits is very plausible. The simplest higher bid that I can back up with certainty is to keep the quantity at 3 but raise the digit to 5. Since I already have three 5s, the bid is definitely met, making it safe against an immediate challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected number of any digit is around 4 (40/10).  A bid of 3 5s is plausible, but my hand doesn't strongly support a higher bid of 5s.  I have three 9s and two 8s. Bidding 4 9s or 4 8s seems more reasonable given my hand and the general probability.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, which means at least four 9s exist among 40 digits. I have no 9s in my hand (67045347), so I have no personal evidence supporting this bid. To make a higher bid, I need to bid at least 4 0s or higher digits with the same quantity. I have two 7s in my hand, but bidding 4 7s is not higher than 4 9s. The next valid bid after 4 9s would be 5 0s or higher quantity. Bidding 5 0s seems risky without seeing many 0s in my hand (I have one 0). Given that 4 9s is already a high bid and I have no 9s, challenging is a reasonable move to test the validity of the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round. My hand is 59868099. I have three 9s, two 8s, one 5, one 6, and one 0. With 32 total digits, a bid of 4 9s seems reasonable based on my hand and the probability of others having 9s. It's a solid starting bid that reflects the strength of my hand in 9s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, which is a safe increase. However, challenging might be a better option since 4 9s seems a bit high with only 32 total digits remaining. I will choose to bid 5 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 6 0s would be a logical next step, increasing the quantity. Given the limited number of total digits remaining (32), and the previous rounds, it seems plausible that there could be at least 6 0s in total amongst the four players. A challenge at this point would be risky as Player 1 has already demonstrated a willingness to bid aggressively and may have a strong hand.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:3 - o3-2025-04-16) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My 8-digit hand (14357545) contains zero 0s. To satisfy the current bid of 6 0s, the other three players would need at least 6 zeros among their combined 24 digits. In a uniform distribution that occurs in roughly 1 out of 25 deals (~4% probability). Even considering the earlier above-average zero counts, it is still far more likely that there are fewer than six zeros outstanding. Challenging gives me a very high chance to knock out Player 3, whereas any legal raise would force me into an even less probable claim. Therefore I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I hold exactly three 5s (5,5,5) in my eight-digit hand. By bidding 3 5s I know the bid is already satisfied by my own cards alone, so any immediate challenge would automatically fail. It’s a solid yet conservative opening bid that keeps plenty of room for later raises.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 59868099. I have one 5, two 8s, two 9s, one 6, and one 0. The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5. With 3 players and 8 digits each, the average count of any digit is 2.4. A bid of 3 5s is slightly above average but plausible. I have two 9s, which is above average for me. Bidding 4 9s is a reasonable increase in quantity and digit based on my hand strength in 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I hold zero 0s. Therefore all five 0s would have to come from the 16 digits of Players 1 and 5. In the previous challenge two rounds ago there were only 5 total 0s among Players 1, 3, 5 and myself (32 digits). Since I still have 0 and Player 3 is now gone, Players 1 and 5 together previously showed at most 4 zeros. It is therefore extremely unlikely they now reach 5 zeros out of just 16 digits (probability well under 5 %). Challenging is far safer than trying to overbid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I’m first to act and cannot challenge. My hand alone contains three 5s, which already meets a bid of 3 5s, making it impossible for the opponent to beat me immediately with a challenge. Starting at quantity 3 (instead of 2) forces Player 5 to raise to a riskier level, and their past tendency to jump to 4 9s would then be an attractive challenge for me. Therefore 3 5s is a safe yet assertive opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 59868099. I have one 5, two 9s, two 8s, one 6, and one 0. The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5, so Player 4 would need to have at least two 5s for the bid to be true. Given there are only 16 total digits, a bid of 3 5s is not unreasonable, but it's also not guaranteed. I have three digits (9, 8, 9) that are higher than 5. I have two 9s in my hand. A bid of 4 9s is a valid higher bid and is supported by my hand. This seems like a strong move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Across the 16 digits in play, at least four 9s must exist for the bid to be correct. I hold zero 9s, so Player 5 would need to have all four (or more) in their own eight-digit hand. The chance of one random eight-digit hand containing four or more 9s is under 1 % (≈0.5 %), making the bid overwhelmingly unlikely. Rather than raise the quantity to 5 of any digit—which is far more plausible and would give Player 5 an easy counter-challenge—I should call their bluff now.
