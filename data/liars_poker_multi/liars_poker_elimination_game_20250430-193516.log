Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The average expected count for any digit across all players is 4.8, making a bid of 3 6s conservative and likely valid. Starting with a higher digit (6) provides strategic flexibility for future bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand and no 6s, so the bid of 3 6s is plausible but not advantageous for me. There are 40 unknown cards, and on average we’d expect about four more 8s among them. Bidding 4 8s leverages my three 8s and only requires one more from the pool, making it a safe raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand is 75148835, which contains two 8s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected count of any digit is 4.8. The bid of 4 8s is plausible. Challenging would be risky as I have two 8s, and only two more are needed from the remaining 40 digits (where the expected count is 4). Bidding is the better option. A standard increase is to go up in quantity. Bidding 5 8s is a plausible quantity increase (from 4 to 5) and is supported by the two 8s I hold. It requires 3 more 8s from the remaining 40 digits, which is likely (expected 4).

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s made by Player 2. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than this. I have the digits 1, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2, 4, 2 in my hand. I see that I have two 4s, but no 8s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48 and there are 48 total digits remaining, bidding a high quantity seems risky without more information. However, I can try to increase the digit to make a reasonable bid. Since I have two 4s and the current bid is on 8s, I could bid on a higher digit than 8, but I need to be cautious about the quantity. Bidding 6 9s seems aggressive without knowing the distribution of 9s, but I could start by bidding 6 4s, as I have two 4s and this increases the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. I have zero 4s in my hand (02028312). The total expected number of 4s across all 48 digits is 4.8. A bid of 6 is slightly above average. Since I have none, the other 5 players (40 digits) must have at least six 4s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 4s among those 40 digits is 4. While 6 is higher than 4, it's not an excessively high bid, making a challenge risky. I should consider a higher bid. My hand contains three 2s and two 0s. A bid of 7 2s requires four 2s among the remaining 40 digits (exactly the expected average of 4). This seems like a statistically strong and relatively safe bid based on my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 3s. With 48 total digits, the average expected count for any digit is 4.8. I have two 3s in my hand, meaning the remaining 40 digits would need at least five 3s to meet the bid. However, the expected number of 3s in those 40 digits is 2.8 (4.8 total - 2 in my hand), making it statistically unlikely the bid is valid. Challenging appears favorable.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With 5 players remaining (40 total digits), bidding 4 6s is a reasonable starting bid for this round, as it requires at least four 6s in total. Since I already have two, it's plausible if other players hold at least two more. This follows the pattern of increasing bids from the previous round (3 6s -> 4 6s).

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. Raising the digit from 6 to 8 at the same quantity of 4 is a minimal increase and very likely—given my three 8s, I only need one more among the 32 unknown digits, which is highly probable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I hold two 8s in my hand, which is above the average expectation per player (40 total digits / 5 players / 10 digits = 0.8 per player). Bidding 5 8s is a direct increase in quantity on the current digit, well-supported by my hand strength and a reasonable expectation across the remaining 40 digits (average is 4 total 8s, plus my two makes 6 expected total). Challenging is risky when I hold two of the bid digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s made by Player 2. I have 2 eights in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 40 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Bidding 6 8s seems reasonable as it is higher than the current bid and takes into account my own hand. However, I should also consider if challenging could be more beneficial, but given my knowledge of my hand and the total digits available, bidding seems like a safer strategy.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (02028312). This means the other 4 players (32 digits) need to have at least five 8s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 8s across all 40 digits is 4. A bid of 6 is above average but plausible, especially since three players (P1, P2, P3) have consecutively bid on 8s, suggesting some strength or a bluff chain. Challenging is risky. My strongest digits are 2s (I have three) and 0s (I have two). The next possible bid quantities are 6 (only 9s) or 7 (any digit). Bidding 7 2s leverages my strong hand in 2s. It requires four 2s among the remaining 32 digits. The expected number of 2s in those 32 digits is 3.2 (32/10). Needing 4 is slightly above average but supported by my holding of 3. This seems safer than challenging the 6 8s bid or bidding high on a digit I hold fewer of.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 2s. I have no 2s in my hand (63300675), meaning all 7 required 2s must be distributed among the remaining 4 players (40 digits). Given the previous successful challenge on 7 3s (actual count 6) and the fact that 7 of any digit is statistically unlikely without any in my hand, challenging seems optimal. If the actual count is <7, I win and eliminate Player 4. If it's ≥7, I lose, but the risk is justified by the low probability of meeting the bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Since this is the start of a new round with 4 players and the current bid is None, bidding 3 6s follows the pattern of previous rounds and leverages the digit I hold twice. Given the total of 32 digits across all players, 3 6s seems plausible and sets a reasonable baseline for subsequent bids.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. With two other players holding 16 unknown digits, there’s about an 81% chance of at least one more 8 appearing. Starting with a bid of 4 8s is a safe opening move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 1. I have two 8s in my hand (75148835). There are 3 players remaining, each with 8 digits, for a total of 24 digits. The average expected count for any digit is 24 / 10 = 2.4. The bid of 4 8s is above this average. Since I have 2 eights, Player 1's bid implies there are at least 2 more 8s among the other two players (Player 1 and Player 3) who hold a combined 16 digits. The expected number of 8s in 16 random digits is 1.6. The probability of having 2 or more 8s in 16 digits is approximately 48.6%. Therefore, the probability that the total count of 8s is 4 or more (my 2 + 2+ from others) is about 48.6%. This means there is a 1 - 0.486 = 51.4% chance that the total count of 8s is less than 4 (my 2 + 0 or 1 from others), in which case challenging wins. Bidding higher, such as 5 8s, would require 3 or more 8s from the other 16 digits, which has a much lower probability (approx 21%). Given the slightly favorable odds of winning the challenge and the risk associated with making a likely false higher bid, challenging is the better strategic move.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. To make a total of four 8s, my opponent needs at least one 8 out of eight unknown digits, which has about a 57% chance. Starting with “4 8s” is a statistically reasonable opening bid that also puts pressure on the opponent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 1. I have 8 8s in my hand, and there are only 16 digits in total for both players. Given that Player 1 has already bid 4 8s, it's possible they have 0-4 8s. With my 8 8s, the total could be 8-12 8s, making 4 8s a potentially valid bid. However, I must consider if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more strategic. Since my hand alone can fulfill the current bid, and making a bid higher than 4 8s, such as 5 8s or 4 9s, seems risky without knowing Player 1's hand, I should challenge if I suspect the bid is unlikely. Given my 8 8s, I find it hard to believe Player 1's bid of 4 8s could be false, so I will make a higher bid.
