Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the starting player, I should make a bid with a high digit to set the floor for the game. I have 3 3s and 4 9s in my hand, but since 9 is the highest digit, I'll bid on it. Starting with a high quantity of 4, as it's a safe assumption that there will be at least this many 9s in the combined hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand and only one 9. The current bid of 4 nines is plausible, so challenging is too risky. Bidding 5 zeros leverages my two 0s and requires just three more zeros among the 40 unknown cards, which is likely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 zeros. I have one '1', one '2', one '6', one '7', one '9', and one '5' in my hand, but no zeros. The previous bid was 4 nines, and now the bid is 5 zeros, which is a higher quantity. Increasing the bid to 6 zeros seems risky since I have no zeros, and 6 zeros out of 48 digits is quite high. However, I can increase the digit at the same quantity level to 5 zeros to 5 ones, which might be safer given I have one '1'. So I will bid 5 ones, which is higher than 5 zeros by digit and plausible.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 5 1s. Bidding 5 2s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. Bidding higher in quantity with the same digit (e.g., 6 2s) would be extremely risky, as it relies on other players having a lot of 2s. Increasing the digit while keeping the quantity at 5 is a safer option. I have two 6s, so bidding 5 6s is reasonable. It's a slight increase in digit and doesn't require others to have a huge number of 6s to be potentially valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. With 48 total digits across 6 players, the expected count for any digit (including 6s) is ~4.8. Since I have zero 6s in my hand and the bid requires at least 5, the bid is slightly above statistical expectation. Player 4’s bid may be a bluff, and challenging seems justified given the low likelihood of meeting or exceeding 5 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. With 40 total digits across 5 players, the average expected count for any digit is 4. Bidding 4 0s aligns with this expectation and leverages my own holdings. Starting with a bid that matches the statistical average increases the likelihood of being correct if challenged later.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s made by Player 5. I have 3 digits in my hand, but none of them are 0. However, I have 3 digits in my hand that are higher than 0. Considering the total digits remaining is 40, I should aim to bid a digit that is likely to be present in at least 4 hands. The digit 3 is a good choice as it's relatively common and I have 2 of them in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand, so bidding “4 4s” only requires three more 4s among the other 32 unknown cards. The probability of at least three 4s in those cards is over 60%, making this a reasonable raise. It is also a minimal legal increase (same quantity, higher digit).

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have one '1' in my hand and no '4's. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Bidding 4 5s or higher digits is possible, but I have no strong evidence to support a higher quantity of any digit. Given the low current bid, bidding 4 5s is a safe increment. I will bid 4 5s to keep the game moving and avoid a risky challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s. Bidding 5 4s increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my hand's 4s while pushing the bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. With 40 total digits across 5 players, the average count per digit is 4. I have one 4 in my hand, making it statistically unlikely that the total count reaches 5. The previous challenge succeeded when a bid of 5 6s had only 4, suggesting players may overbid. Challenging this bid carries calculated risk but aligns with the probability of the count being below 5.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains three 4s. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid that reflects my hand's highest frequency. Bidding 3 4s is a logical first move, as it accurately represents the count in my hand and sets a baseline for subsequent bids.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have only one ‘4’ in my hand and there are 24 unknown digits. For there to be at least 4 total 4s, the other players must hold 3 or more 4s, which has under a 45% chance. It’s more likely the bid is false, so I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have only one 4 in my hand. Since 24 digits remain in total, 5 4s is plausible. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 5 and increase the digit. I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding 5 5s is a reasonable next step, as it is a higher digit at the same quantity and aligns with my hand strength.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 4s. I have one '4' in my hand and no '5's. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Bidding 7 5s seems risky since I have no '5's, and the quantity is already high. Increasing the quantity to 8 0s or higher is possible since 0s are common, but I have only one '0' in my hand. The previous bids indicate some confidence in '4's and '5's. Challenging 7 4s might be risky as the actual count could be 7 or more given previous bids and the presence of '4's in my hand and others. Therefore, the safest move is to bid 7 5s, increasing the digit but keeping the quantity, putting pressure on the next player.
