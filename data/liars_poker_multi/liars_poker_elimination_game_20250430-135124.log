Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and need to make the opening bid. My hand is 97419473, containing two 9s, two 7s, two 4s, one 1, and one 3. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits. The expected average count for any digit is 4.8. Since I hold two 9s, it's statistically very likely (expected count suggests ~2.8 more 9s among the other 40 digits) that there are at least three 9s in total across all hands. Bidding '3 9s' is a reasonably safe opening bid based on my hand, uses my highest pair, and sets a slightly challenging baseline for the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which is likely true given the probability of other players holding at least one 9. Bidding 4 9s increases the quantity while maintaining the digit, leveraging my existing 9s and the high likelihood of additional 9s in the remaining digits. Challenging would risk elimination as the bid is probable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 9s and I have no 9s in my hand (46386774), I must consider the likelihood of there being at least 4 nines among all players. Since each player has 8 digits, the maximum number of any digit one player can have is 8. With 6 players, the theoretical maximum for any single digit across all hands is 48. However, achieving exactly 4 nines seems plausible but not guaranteed, especially without knowing the distribution of digits among other players. Considering my own hand and the goal to make a higher bid or challenge, I notice I have multiple occurrences of the digit 6 and 7, but to make a bid higher than 4 9s, I would need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have enough information to confidently challenge the bid of 4 9s without risking elimination if I'm wrong, and given that bidding on a digit I have more of (like 6 or 7) might be safer but needs to be higher than the current bid, I must weigh the risks. Given the constraints, making a bid that is both reasonable and strategically sound is challenging without more information about other players' hands. However, since I must make a move, challenging seems risky without a strong basis, so I'll consider bidding on a digit I have, aiming to increase the quantity or digit value, but given my hand and the need to exceed '4 9s', a safe increase considering the digits I hold would be difficult. Thus, considering the rules and aiming for a strategic move, I'll opt to challenge the current bid as it seems risky to bid higher without more confidence in the digits' distribution across other players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: As the starting player, I need to make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 9s, so bidding 3 9s is a reasonable starting point. This allows others to raise the bid or challenge if they doubt the count. Since the previous round's 9s count was 7 (with 6 players), this round's lower player count might reduce the total, but 3 9s remains plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 90400169, which contains two 9s. The current bid is 3 9s by Player 1, and with 5 active players, there are 40 total digits. Since I already have two 9s, the bid of 3 9s means only one more 9 is needed across the other 32 digits, which is very plausible. I don't think challenging is wise here. Instead, I will make a higher bid. I can bid 4 9s, as I have two 9s myself, and it's possible there are two more among the remaining digits. This keeps the pressure on while staying within a reasonable range based on my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. Since I don't have any 9s in my hand, and the bidding on 9s has already gone to 4, I should bid a higher quantity of a different digit. I will bid 5 0s, since I have one 0 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I see only one 0 in my hand, so I estimate roughly a 40% chance that there are four more 0s in the other 32 unseen digits – a risky 40% chance of me being eliminated if I challenge. A safer play is to raise. I hold two 5s, so only three more 5s would be needed among the 32 unknown digits. Given the expected distribution (≈3.2 fives among the unknown digits), the probability that there are at least three more 5s is a bit over 60%, making the bid of 5 5s quite reasonable. This bid is strictly higher than 5 0s (same quantity, higher digit) and keeps me in the game without taking the immediate 40% elimination risk of a challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. The expected average count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. The bid of 5 is slightly above average. My hand (97419473) contains zero 5s. This means the remaining 32 digits held by the other 4 players must contain at least five 5s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 5s among those 32 digits is 3.2. Requiring 5 or more 5s from the other 32 digits seems less likely than average. While I could bid 5 7s or 5 9s (having two of each), challenging the 5 5s bid feels statistically safer given I hold none.

Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to start the bidding in this round with 4 players and 32 total digits. The expected average count for any digit is 3.2 (32/10). My hand is 97419473, containing two 9s, two 7s, and two 4s. A reasonable opening bid is typically around the expected value, potentially influenced by my hand. I have two 9s. Bidding '3 9s' aligns with the expected value and leverages my hand strength in 9s. It's a safe but informative opening bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 90400169, which contains three 9s. The current bid is 4 9s by Player 1. Since I have three 9s myself, it's plausible that there is at least one more 9 among the other 24 digits across the remaining players, making the total of 4 9s possible. However, I need to make a higher bid. I can bid 5 0s, as I have two 0s in my hand, and with 32 total digits, it's a reasonable escalation. Bidding higher on 9s (like 5 9s) feels risky since I only have three, and the likelihood of two more 9s in the remaining digits is uncertain. Alternatively, I could challenge, but with my three 9s, the bid of 4 9s seems too likely to be true. Therefore, I'll bid 5 0s to stay safe and push the bid higher.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 6 0s seems like a reasonable increase, and I can contribute to the count. It's also a relatively safe bid, as 0s are often underbid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have zero 0s in my hand (97419473). While the average number of any digit across 32 total digits is 3.2, Player 3 bid 5 0s and Player 4 raised to 6 0s, suggesting they might hold some or are bluffing. Challenging is risky. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 7 0s+ or 6 [digit > 0]s. Bidding 7 0s is very risky with no 0s. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s. In this round, I bid 3 9s and Player 1 bid 4 9s. In the previous round, Player 1 and Player 3 also bid 9s. This history suggests 9s might be relatively common. Bidding 6 9s requires four more 9s among the other 24 digits held by the other three players. Given the bidding history and my two 9s, this seems more plausible and safer than challenging the 6 0s bid or bidding on a digit I hold fewer of.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. With 32 total digits, the expected number of 9s is around 3.2, making 6 9s unusually high. Even accounting for my two 9s, the remaining three players would need at least four more 9s to meet the bid. This seems unlikely given the average distribution of digits. Challenging is the best option to test the validity of the bid.

My hand is 97419473, containing two 9s, two 7s, and two 4s. Given I have two 9s, and the expected number from the other 16 unknown digits is 1.6 (16/10), a total of 3 or 4 nines is statistically likely.

Since I have three 9s myself, I know the bid is already met just with my hand, making it very likely to be true or even exceeded with the other players' digits. The total digits remaining are 24 across three players. I can make a higher bid to push the game forward. Bidding 4 9s seems reasonable since I already contribute three 9s, and it's plausible that there is at least one more 9 among the other 16 digits. This bid increases the quantity while staying on a strong digit for me.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s made by Player 4. I have zero 0s in my hand (97419473). For the bid to be true, the other two players (Player 3 and Player 4) must have at least five 0s among their combined 16 digits. The expected number of 0s in those 16 digits is 1.6 (16 * 1/10). While 5 is significantly higher than expected, Player 4 has bid 0s consistently in previous rounds, suggesting they might hold several. Challenging is tempting but risky if Player 4 holds many 0s. Alternatively, I hold two 9s. Player 3 bid 4 9s earlier this round, indicating they likely hold some 9s as well. Combining my two 9s with Player 3's likely 9s makes a bid of 5 9s plausible. This bid is higher than 5 0s (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages information from my hand and the bidding history. It shifts the decision to Player 3.

With a total of 24 digits across three players, it's possible that there are at least two more 9s in the other players' hands, especially since 9s have been frequently bid on in previous rounds, indicating a potential concentration. Given that I have three 9s myself, the bid of 5 9s seems plausible (3 from me + 2 from others is feasible). Challenging might be risky as the actual count could meet or exceed 5. Instead, I can make a higher bid. I'll bid 6 0s, as I have three 0s in my hand, and it's a reasonable increase in quantity while switching to a digit I have some strength in. This keeps the game moving and avoids an immediate challenge risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s, made by Player 4. There are 24 total digits among the 3 players. My hand (97419473) contains only one '1'. For the bid of 7 1s to be true, the other two players (Player 3 and Player 4) must hold at least six '1's combined in their 16 digits. The expected number of '1's in those 16 digits is 16 * 0.1 = 1.6. Requiring 6 '1's is significantly above the expected value (almost 4 times higher). While not impossible, it's statistically unlikely. Player 4 jumped from Player 3's 6 0s bid to 7 1s, which is a significant jump and could be a bluff. Making a higher bid, like 7 2s or higher, or 8 0s, feels risky as well, as these quantities are high relative to the total number of digits. Given the low probability of 7 1s being accurate based on my hand and statistical expectation, challenging is the most logical move.

Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and it's my turn to start the bidding. My hand is 97419473, containing two 9s, two 7s, two 4s, one 1, and one 3. There are 16 total digits between me and Player 3. Since I hold two 9s, bidding '2 9s' is completely safe. However, a slightly stronger opening bid is often better. Statistically, Player 3 is likely to have at least one 9 among their 8 digits (expected value is 0.8). Therefore, bidding '3 9s' is a reasonable and plausible opening bid based on my hand and the probabilities involved.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 90400169, which contains two 9s and two 0s. The current bid by Player 0 is 3 9s. Since there are only 16 total digits remaining across both hands, and I have two 9s, it's possible that Player 0 has at least one 9 to make the total count 3. However, I can make a higher bid to push the game forward. Bidding 4 9s seems reasonable since I already contribute two 9s, and it's plausible that Player 0 has at least two more 9s or I can bluff. This bid increases the quantity and keeps the digit the same, which is a valid higher bid. I’ll avoid challenging at this stage since 3 9s is not an outrageous bid given the total digits.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 97419473, containing two 9s, two 7s, and two 4s. The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 3. There are 16 total digits. For the current bid to be true, Player 3 needs at least two 9s (since I have two). Player 3 raised my initial bid of 3 9s, suggesting they likely have at least one or two 9s, making a challenge risky for me. I need to bid higher than 4 9s. The next quantity level is 5. Bidding 5 9s would require Player 3 to have three 9s, which is possible but becoming less likely. Alternatively, I can switch digits and bid 5 0s, 5 1s, etc. I have two 7s and two 4s. Bidding 5 7s requires Player 3 to have three 7s out of their 8 digits. This is plausible and shifts the pressure to a new digit based on my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 90400169, so I have two 9s, two 0s, one 4, one 1, one 6, and no 7s. The current bid is 5 7s by Player 0. Since there are only 16 total digits in play (8 mine, 8 theirs), and I have no 7s, the bid of 5 7s means Player 0 must have at least 5 7s in their hand for the bid to be true, which is possible but somewhat unlikely given the distribution of digits. However, challenging carries a high risk since if they do have 5 or more 7s, I lose. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, and the previous bids have been around 9s, with my last bid being 4 9s. I can safely bid higher by increasing the quantity or digit. Bidding 5 9s is a reasonable escalation, as I have two 9s myself, and it's plausible that Player 0 has at least three 9s given their earlier bids on 9s. This keeps the pressure on without taking the immediate risk of a challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 97419473, containing two 9s. The current bid is 5 9s by Player 3. For this bid to be true, Player 3 needs at least 3 nines (since 5 total - 2 in my hand = 3). Player 3 previously bid 4 9s and then raised my 5 7s bid to 5 9s, suggesting confidence in the digit 9. Challenging 5 9s wins if Player 3 has 0, 1, or 2 nines, but loses if they have 3 or more. Given their bidding, having at least 3 nines seems plausible. The next possible bid is 6 0s. However, I have two 9s myself, making a bid of 6 9s a strong possibility. This bid requires Player 3 to have at least 4 nines for it to be true if challenged. Bidding 6 9s leverages my holding of two 9s and puts the pressure back on Player 3. If Player 3 has exactly 3 nines, they might be hesitant to challenge 6 9s. If they have 4 or more nines, they will challenge, and I will win. If they have fewer than 3 nines, challenging their 5 9s bid would have been better, but bidding 6 9s is a strong play based on my hand and their prior actions.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 90400169, which contains three 9s. The current bid by Player 0 is 6 9s. Since there are only 16 total digits in play (8 mine, 8 theirs), and I have three 9s, Player 0 must have at least three 9s for the bid to hold true. This is possible, as they could have up to five 9s in their hand. Given the bidding history, Player 0 has consistently bid on 9s, suggesting they likely have a strong count of 9s. Previous challenges on 9s (like 6 9s earlier) resulted in the bidder winning, reinforcing that Player 0 may have a high number of 9s. Bidding higher, such as 7 9s, would require at least four 9s in Player 0's hand if I commit to that, which is less certain. I could bid on another digit, like 7 0s, since I have three 0s, but Player 0 might challenge if they have few 0s. Given the risk, I’ll bid conservatively with 7 0s, leveraging my three 0s and hoping Player 0 has at least one or two, making the total plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s made by Player 3. There are 16 total digits between Player 3 and me. My hand (97419473) contains zero 0s. For the bid of 7 0s to be true, Player 3 must possess at least seven 0s in their 8-digit hand. This is statistically extremely unlikely. Therefore, the bid is highly suspect and challenging is the best course of action.
