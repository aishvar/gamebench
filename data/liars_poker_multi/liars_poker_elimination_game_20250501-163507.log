Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Since the current bid is 'None', I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 2 7s is a safe starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. The current bid of '2 7s' is quite conservative, as it's likely there are at least 2 sevens among all players given I already have one. Since I also have two 9s in my hand, I can confidently bid '2 9s', which is higher than '2 7s' due to the higher digit while keeping the same quantity.

Player 2 Reasoning: The bid of 2 9s is very likely true (P(>=2 9s)≈96%), and I have no 9s, so challenging is too risky. To raise, I need at least 3 of some digit. I hold two 3s, and the probability of at least one more 3 among the other 40 digits is over 98%, making “3 3s” a safe increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s made by Player 2. I have a 3 in my hand, so I can increase the digit to 3. I also have a 4 in my hand, so I can increase the quantity to 4. Bidding 4 3s seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits. The expected average count for any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8. The bid of 4 3s is therefore statistically plausible. I have zero 3s in my hand (41762089). This means the other 5 players (40 digits) must hold at least four 3s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 3s among those 40 digits is 40 / 10 = 4. Given that Player 2 bid 3 3s and Player 3 immediately raised to 4 3s, it suggests they might collectively hold several 3s, making the bid potentially accurate. Challenging seems risky as the bid is close to the statistical average and supported by previous bidding. I should make a higher bid. Possible bids are '4 4s' or higher quantity bids like '5 0s'. I have one 4 in my hand. The total expected number of 4s is 4.8. My contribution plus the expected contribution from others (1 + 4 = 5) supports a bid of '4 4s'. This is a minimal, safe increase over the current bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. I could bid 5 4s, or 4 of a higher number. Given the game history, 4 3s was bid previously. I will bid 5 4s to increase the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 5 4s, which means there would need to be at least four more 4s among the other five players (total of 40 digits). Given that the previous bids have been relatively low and the current bid is a significant jump, it's unlikely that there are five 4s in total. Therefore, challenging seems like the best option.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Since the current bid is None and I'm starting the bidding, I can make any valid bid. Starting with a bid of 2 7s is reasonable given my hand and the fact that there are 40 digits in play.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the bid of 2 7s seems reasonable. Since I have strong high digits (two 9s) and the previous round history shows players were comfortable with higher quantities, I can make a strategic bid of 2 9s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. With 32 unknown cards, the chance of at least one more 3 is over 96%, making a bid of 3 3s very likely. Challenging 2 9s is riskier since it's around 84% likely to be true, so raising with 3 3s is safer.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have two 6s, one 0, one 1, and four 2s in my hand. I don't have any 3s. Given the current bid, I should aim to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have no 3s, I'll focus on increasing the digit. The next highest digit in my hand is 6, so I'll make a bid of 3 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 41762089, containing one 6. The current bid is 3 6s. With 40 total digits among 5 players, the expected average count for any digit is 4 (40/10). A bid of 3 6s is below the expected average and is therefore likely to be accurate, making a challenge very risky. I must place a higher bid. The minimum valid bids are 3 7s, 3 8s, or 3 9s. My hand contains one 7. Player 0 previously bid 2 7s in this round, indicating they might hold at least one 7. Combining my 7 and Player 0's likely 7(s), a bid of 3 7s is plausible (needing only one or two more 7s from the remaining 24 digits held by Players 1, 2, and 3). This is the minimum possible increase and seems like a safe progression.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which is plausible given my hand and the fact that there are four other players. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 4 7s seems too aggressive, but bidding 3 8s is a safer option as it maintains the quantity but increases the digit. I don't have any 8s, but it's possible other players do.

Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 8. The current bid is 3 8s. Given that I only have one 8, and there are 5 players total, the bid of 3 8s is quite reasonable as other players likely have some 8s too. I see I have two 9s in my hand, so I can safely bid '3 9s', which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is supported by my own hand containing two 9s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. To bid 4 6s I only need two more 6s among the 32 unknown digits, which has a probability of about 84%. This is a plausible increase over 3 9s, so I should raise.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 2. Based on my hand, I can increase the quantity to 5 and keep the digit as 6, making it a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. The expected average count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. The bid of 5 is slightly above the average. I have one 6 in my hand (41762089). This means the other 4 players (32 digits) need to have at least four 6s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 6s among the other 32 digits is 3.2. So, 4 is slightly above average for the remaining digits, making the bid plausible but potentially challengeable. Player 2 bid 4 6s and Player 3 immediately raised to 5 6s, which could indicate strength in 6s between them or a bluff. Instead of challenging a borderline bid, I can make a minimal higher bid. The next possible bids are 5 7s, 5 8s, 5 9s, or 6 0s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 5 7s is statistically similar in likelihood to 5 6s (I have one 7, need 4 more from 32 digits). This passes the pressure to the next player (Player 0) who previously bid 2 7s. It's a safer move than challenging or jumping to a quantity of 6.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 5 7s, which is quite high given that there are only 40 digits in total and 5 players. Considering the previous challenge where a bid of 5 4s was too high (actual count was 4), it's likely that 5 7s is also an overbid. I should challenge this bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7. The current bid of 2 7s is quite conservative given there are 32 total digits in play. Based on the previous rounds, Player 0 tends to start with cautious bids and has shown good judgment in challenging high bids. Given I have one 9 in my hand, and 9 is the highest possible digit, I can safely bid 2 9s.

However, with 4 players remaining, it's possible that the other players have at least two 6s combined. I can either bid higher or challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. Player 0 has bid 3 7s, and based on the previous rounds where a bid of 5 7s was challenged and proven false (actual count was 4), it's likely there aren't many more 7s in other players' hands. Since I only see one 7 in my hand, and Player 0 has consistently bid on 7s throughout the game, they might have one or two 7s. However, getting to 3 total would require another player to have a 7, which seems possible but not certain. Given my hand has a 9, I can make a safe bid of 3 9s, which is higher than 3 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand. With only 16 total digits, all sevens must come from Player 0’s 8 cards. The probability they hold at least two sevens is under 20%, so the bid is unlikely.
