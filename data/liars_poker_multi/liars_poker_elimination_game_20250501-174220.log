Player 0 Reasoning: Since no previous bid has been made, I can start by making an initial bid. Looking at my hand (15024704), I have the following counts: 1s: 2, 2s: 2, 4s: 2, 7s: 2, 0s: 2, 5s: 1. The highest counts are 2 for several digits. To be safe and reasonable, I will bid 2 4s, as I have two 4s and this is a plausible starting bid without overestimating others' hands.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 00786568, which includes no 4s. The current bid is 2 4s by Player 0, which is a low bid and likely plausible given there are 48 total digits across 6 players. Since I have no 4s, I don't have strong information to challenge this bid. Instead, I will make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 3 6s feels reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 2 4s. This bid should be safe enough while still pushing the game forward.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand. Since the average total count for any digit across all players is approximately 4.8, bidding 4 3s is a reasonable increase from the current bid of 3 6s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s, meaning at least four 3s exist among all players. I have two 3s in my hand (digits: 46196931). Since there are 48 digits total, having at least four 3s is plausible. I need to bid higher than 4 3s. The next higher bid could be 4 4s or more. I have one 4 in my hand, so bidding 4 4s is a reasonable increase and not too risky.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand and only one 4, so challenging 4 4s is unwise. Bidding 5 5s leverages my strong holding: I need just two more 5s among the 40 unknown digits (expected ~4), making it a safe upward move.

Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (45828177), I have zero 5s. The current bid is 5 5s made by Player 4. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For there to be at least 5 fives, the other 5 players would need to have those 5s among their 40 digits. This is certainly possible. However, I do have a strong hand with two 7s, which gives me confidence to bid on 7s. I could bid 5 7s, which maintains the same quantity but increases the digit value. This seems like a reasonable move given my hand strength in 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. To beat this bid, I need to either bid at least 6 7s or keep the same quantity but with a higher digit (8 or 9). Given my hand (1, 5, 0, 2, 4, 7, 0, 4), I have only one 7, so I cannot confidently bid 6 7s. I also have no 8s or 9s, so increasing the digit isn't possible. The total remaining digits are 48, so a bid of 6 7s is possible but seems unlikely given my hand. Challenging might be a better move, but I should consider the previous bids. Since the previous bid was 5 7s, and I have only one 7, challenging seems reasonable to test if the total count is really that high.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The previous round ended with a challenge and no current bid, meaning I can start the bidding. My hand contains the digits 1, 5, 0, 2, 4, 7, 0, 4. Counting my digits: 0 appears twice, 1 once, 2 once, 4 twice, 5 once, 7 once. The most frequent digit I hold is 0 with 2 copies. To make a safe opening bid, I should choose a quantity that I can confidently support based on my hand. Since I have two 0s, bidding 2 0s seems reasonable. Alternatively, I could bid 2 4s because I also have two 4s. Bidding 2 4s might be slightly more strategic, as 4s are generally more common in the game, but I should keep my bid conservative to avoid an early challenge. I will start with 2 4s, which I have in my hand, making it a plausible bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 00786568, which contains two 6s and two 8s, among other digits. The current bid is 2 4s by Player 0, which is a very low bid given that there are 40 total digits across 5 players. Since I have no 4s in my hand, I don't have direct information to support or challenge this bid. However, with 40 digits in play, a bid of 2 4s is highly likely to be true, as it's only about 5% of the total digits. Challenging such a low bid is risky because the probability of there being at least two 4s across all hands is quite high. Therefore, I will make a higher bid. Since I have two 6s, bidding on 6s feels safer. I will bid 3 6s, which is a modest increase in quantity and digit over the current bid of 2 4s, and it aligns with the strength of my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand. Bidding 4 3s is a logical step up from the previous bid of 3 6s (higher quantity), and with three 3s in my hand, it's plausible that there's at least one more 3 in the other players' hands.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have two 3s in my hand (digits: 4 6 1 9 6 9 3 1), which supports the possibility of the bid being valid. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. Since bidding 4 4s is the next possible valid bid, and I have one 4 in my hand, I will bid 4 4s to increase the digit while maintaining the quantity.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand. The current bid is 4 4s, so bidding 4 5s is the smallest valid raise. I only need one more 5 among the 32 unknown digits, which is highly likely (~97%).

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I can challenge this bid because, with only 40 total digits and 8 digits per player, it is quite unlikely that there are 4 or more 5s across all hands, especially given my own hand. My hand contains only one 5 (the digit '5'), so the total number of 5s in all hands cannot exceed 1. Therefore, challenging the bid of 4 5s is a logical move to potentially eliminate the previous bidder and win the game.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 00786568, which contains one 5, two 6s, two 8s, one 7, and two 0s. The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 4. Since I have one 5 in my hand, and there are 32 total digits across 4 players, it’s plausible that there are at least two more 5s among the other 24 digits. Given the bidding history, bids have been conservative so far in this round. I think it’s safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I’ll bid 3 6s, as I have two 6s myself, making it a reasonable increase in digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 00786568, which contains two 6s, two 8s, one 0, one 5, and one 7. The current bid is 4 5s by Player 4. I only have one 5 in my hand, so there must be at least three more 5s among the other 24 digits across Players 2, 3, and 4 for the bid to hold. Given that there are 32 total digits, the bid of 4 5s seems plausible but not overly high. In past rounds, a bid of 4 5s was challenged and held with a count of 5, suggesting 5s might be somewhat common. However, I don't want to challenge yet as the risk of losing is significant. Instead, I will make a higher bid. Since I have two 6s, bidding 4 6s feels reasonable as it increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, and I contribute half of the required count myself. This bid balances risk and believability.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. With 32 total digits across four players, the expected number of 6s is ~3.2 (including my own).

Player 1 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 00786568, which gives me two 0s, two 6s, two 8s, one 5, and one 7. With a total of 24 digits across all three active players, I should make a conservative bid to start. Bidding on a digit I have some of, like 3 6s, seems reasonable as I have two 6s myself, and it's likely there is at least one more among the other players' 16 digits. This bid also sets a moderate baseline for the round.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 00786568, which contains one 5 and two 6s. The current bid by Player 4 is 4 5s, meaning they claim there are at least four 5s across all 24 digits. Since I only have one 5, the other two players would need to contribute at least three 5s combined for the bid to hold, which is possible but not highly likely given the distribution. However, challenging carries a risk since there are still 16 digits I haven't seen. Instead, I can make a safer bid. I have two 6s, and bidding 4 6s aligns with my hand strength and the previous bidding patterns (I previously bid 3 6s and won a challenge with an actual count of 5). Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable escalation and a higher bid than 4 5s.

With only 16 total digits remaining across both players, and knowing I have one 5, there need to be at least two more 5s in Player 4's hand for the bid to hold. This is possible but not guaranteed. However, I also have a strong count of 6s (two in my hand), so bidding higher with 3 6s seems reasonable and safer than challenging, as it leverages my own hand strength while increasing the digit. I could bid higher quantities, but I want to avoid overbidding early with only two players left. Therefore, I will bid 3 6s.
