Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the round. I have two 6s and two 7s in my hand. Bidding 1 6s is a safe opening bid, as I know there are at least two 6s in the game. It's low enough that it's likely to be accurate, but not so low that it invites immediate challenges.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (54968016), I have one 6. The current bid is '1 6s', which means Player 0 is claiming there's at least one 6 among all players. Since I already have one 6 in my hand, I know this bid is definitely valid. I need to make a higher bid. I could either increase the quantity (e.g., '2 6s') or keep the same quantity but increase the digit (e.g., '1 7s', '1 8s', etc.). Since I have one 6, one 8, one 9, and one 5 in my hand, I know these digits exist. I'll bid '2 6s' since I already know of one 6 (mine) and it's reasonable to assume at least one more 6 exists among the other 40 digits held by other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s, which is quite low given there are 6 players and 48 total digits (expected average is 4.8 for any digit). Challenging this low bid is risky. My hand is 56038894, which contains two 8s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid. Since I hold two 8s, I only need one more 8 to be present among the other 5 players (40 digits total). The expected number of 8s among 40 digits is 4. It is very likely that at least one 8 exists among the other players. This bid leverages my hand strength and is a plausible increase.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which seems high given that I have none. However, with 5 other players, it's possible that 3 8s exist in total. To be safe, I'll make a higher bid on a digit I have more of. I have two 1s, so I'll bid 4 1s, increasing the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 (from 23990743), and there are 5 other players. Assuming an even distribution, the total count of 1s across 6 players is likely to be around 6-8 (since each player has 8 digits). However, I should be cautious. Bidding higher on 1s or switching to a higher digit seems reasonable. I'll bid 4 2s, increasing the digit.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have 3 2s in my hand. The current bid is 4 2s made by Player 4, which is a valid bid. Since I have a higher quantity of 2s, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity to 5 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. Bidding higher than 5 2s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 6 2s seems risky given I have no 2s. Increasing the digit to 5 3s, 5 4s, etc. is also risky without knowing what others have. However, 5 2s is a relatively high bid, and I have no 2s. Challenging seems like a reasonable strategy to try and eliminate Player 5.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, meaning I can bid anything. I have four 6s in my hand. Bidding 2 6s is a safe and reasonable opening bid, considering my hand and the fact that other players have already shown interest in 6s in the previous round. It's a conservative approach to start the round.

Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (54968016), I have one 6 in it. The current bid is 2 6s, which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 2 sixes among all players. Since I already have one 6, this claim seems quite reasonable - we only need one more 6 among the other 4 players, which is very likely. I could challenge, but the risk seems high. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I could increase the quantity to 3 6s, but that's risky without knowing more. I could also keep the quantity at 2 but increase the digit to 8s, 9s, or even 0s (all of which I have in my hand). Since I have an 8 and a 9 in my hand, bidding 2 8s or 2 9s would be safer. I'll go with 2 9s since it's the highest digit I can confidently bid at this quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. My hand is 56038894, which contains two 8s and one 9. There are 5 players and 40 total digits remaining. The average expected count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. The current bid of 2 9s is below average and plausible. Challenging it seems risky, as only one more 9 is needed from the other 4 players' 32 digits for the bid to be true. My hand is strongest in 8s (I have two). Bidding 3 8s is a valid bid (higher quantity than 2 9s) and is based on my strongest digit. It's also below the average expected count (3 vs 4), making it a relatively safe and reasonable bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand (50131209). The current bid is 3 8s, which seems high given that I have none and there are only 4 other players. The previous round saw a challenge on a similar bid (5 2s) which was unsuccessful. Given the low probability of 3 8s existing across all hands, I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round. My hand contains two 8s. With 4 players and 32 total digits, the average count for any digit is 3.2. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable starting bid, as I need only one more 8 from the other 3 players to meet the bid, which is quite likely.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have the digits 23990743, which includes two 3s and no 8s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I don't have any 8s and there are 3 8s bid, it's possible that the total count of 8s is indeed 3 or more across all players. However, I can bid on a higher digit. I will bid 3 9s because it's a higher digit and I have one 9 in my hand, making it plausible that there could be 3 or more 9s in total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding 4 9s would be a pure bluff, and given the limited total digits (32) and the fact that Player 4 just bid 3 9s, it seems unlikely there are four 9s in total. Therefore, challenging is the best course of action.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The game has just started with no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 23990743, which contains two 2s, two 3s, one 9, one 7, and two 4s. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I see in my hand. I have a total of 2 '2's and 2 '3's. I can start by bidding on a digit that I have. Bidding 3 3s seems like a safe and reasonable starting point because it's slightly above the count I have, considering there are two other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the likelihood of there being 3 or more 3s in the game. Looking at my own hand (54968016), I have zero 3s. For there to be at least 3 3s, the other two players would need to have at least 3 3s between them. With 8 digits per player, this is certainly possible. Since I have one 6 in my hand, I could safely bid '3 6s', which is higher than '3 3s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to '4 3s', but that's riskier since I don't have any 3s myself. I'll go with the safer option of keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 1. My hand is 56038894. I have one 6. The bid of 3 6s means Player 1 and Player 4 combined must have at least two more 6s among their 16 digits. This is plausible (expected count for 6s in 16 digits is 1.6). Challenging doesn't seem like the best move here. To bid higher, I can either bid 3 of a digit higher than 6, or 4 or more of any digit. My hand contains two 8s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit than 3 6s). With two 8s in my hand, I only need one more 8 from the remaining 16 digits to make the bid true. The expected count of 8s in 16 digits is 1.6, making it quite likely that at least one more 8 exists. This is a strong bid based on my hand. Bidding 4 or more of any digit seems too risky given my hand and the total digits remaining. Bidding 3 9s is also an option (I have one 9, need two more from 16 digits), but 3 8s is stronger as I have two 8s already.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. My hand is 23990743, which contains two 3s and no 8s or 9s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I don't have information about the other players' hands, I'll base my decision on my hand and the current bid. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit. However, I should consider the likelihood of the bid being true. Given that there are 24 digits in total and I have none of the 8s or 9s, there are 16 digits left among the other two players. It's plausible they could have 3 or more 9s. Thus, bidding 3 9s seems like a viable strategy.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (54968016), I have only one 9 (out of my 8 digits). The current bid is 3 9s across all players' hands. With 3 players having 8 digits each, there are 24 total digits in play. For the bid of 3 9s to be valid, there need to be at least 2 more 9s among the other players' hands. This is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's risky since Player 4 has consistently bid 9s in previous rounds, suggesting they might have some. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Since I have two 0s in my hand, bidding 4 0s seems reasonable - I need only 2 more 0s from the other players, which is plausible.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. My hand is 56038894, containing one 0 and two 8s. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid is plausible as I hold two 8s, meaning only two more 8s are needed from the remaining 16 digits across the other two players. This seems more likely or equally likely as challenging 4 0s (which would require 3 or more 0s among the other 16 digits for me to lose the challenge). Bidding 4 8s leverages my hand strength and passes the turn to the next player.

Since I have no 8s and there are 16 digits held by other players, it's possible they have some 8s, but bidding more than 4 seems risky given the total count is 24. However, I can bid on a higher digit. The next higher digit is 9, and I have one 9. So, bidding 4 9s is a valid move as it is a higher digit with the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 3/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '4 9s'. Looking at my hand (54968016), I have one 9. For there to be at least 4 nines total, the other two players would need to have at least 3 more nines between them. With 8 digits per player and 3 players total, there are 24 total digits. The probability of having at least 4 nines out of 24 digits is reasonable. Since I already have one 9, I only need 3 more from the other 16 digits the other players have. I could bid '5 0s' since I have one 0 in my hand, but that would be risky as I'd need 4 more zeros from other players. Instead, I'll challenge the current bid of '4 9s' because while possible, it's somewhat unlikely that the other two players have exactly 3 more nines between them when they could have any digit from 0-9.

A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and the total number of digits (16). I have a total of 3 digits that are either 2 or 3.
