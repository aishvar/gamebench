Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 9 in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start by bidding on a digit that I have. Bidding on the digit 9 seems reasonable, and I have a high chance of winning. I'll start with a low quantity to be safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current game state. The current bid is '1 9s', which is a very low bid. Looking at my hand (52754537), I don't have any 9s, but I do have two 5s and three 7s. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each (48 total digits), and the bid is only claiming there's at least one 9 among all players, this is likely true even though I don't have any 9s myself. I should make a higher bid based on digits I have in my hand. Since I have three 7s, I could confidently bid '2 7s' knowing I already have more than that. I could also bid on 5s since I have two of them. Alternatively, I could simply increase the digit and bid '1 0s', but that's not leveraging my knowledge. I'll bid '2 7s' which is higher than '1 9s' and based on my actual hand contents.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s would be a lie, and likely challenged. I could challenge the 2 7s, but it's a relatively low bid, and someone might actually have two 7s. Instead, I will bid 2 8s. This increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a reasonable move given my hand contains an 8.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '2 8s' by Player 2, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have the digits 23054016 in my hand, I notice I have one 0 and other digits that are not 8s. Increasing the quantity or the digit value is necessary. Considering the total digits remaining (48) and the fact that I don't have any 8s or 9s in my hand, bidding on a higher digit seems more reasonable than increasing the quantity of 8s. However, given that I do not have any 9s and only one 0, and the goal is to make a higher bid, I should consider bidding on a digit that is higher than 8 but taking into account the distribution of digits I have. Since my hand does not directly support bidding higher quantities of high digits without more information, and considering the need to make a strategic move, I will choose to bid on a digit that is not too high but still higher than 8, if possible, or consider the challenge if the current bid seems unlikely given the total number of digits and their distribution.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand already. With 40 unseen digits among the other five players, the odds of there being at least one additional 2 are very high. By raising the quantity from 2 to 3 (and choosing a digit Iâ€™m strong in), I make a safe, legal increase over the current bid of 2 9s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s made by Player 4. I have the digits 6, 0, 9, 8, 1, 9, 3, 8 in my hand. I see that there are 2 occurrences of the digit 8 and 2 occurrences of the digit 9. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. The bid must be strictly higher than 3 2s. I can start by bidding on a digit I have, like 8 or 9. Bidding 2 9s seems reasonable as it's higher in digit compared to 3 2s and I have two 9s in my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have many high digits, bidding 3 3s seems like a reasonable increase in digit value. This also takes into account that other players may have higher digits or more 2s, making the 3 2s potentially easy to beat.

Player 0 Reasoning: Considering my hand, I have 9s, 8s, and 7s. The current bid is 3 3s. Since I have no 3s, I should increase the digit to a higher value. My hand also has two 8s, making a bid of 3 8s a reasonable choice.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (52754537), I have zero 8s. Player 0 has bid 3 8s, meaning they believe there are at least 3 eights among all 48 digits. Since I don't have any 8s, all 3 would need to come from the other 5 players' hands (40 digits total). This is certainly possible, as it only requires about 7.5% of the remaining digits to be 8s, which is not unreasonable. I could challenge, but it's a risky move at this early stage. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 7s. I'll bid 4 7s, increasing the quantity to a level I'm still comfortable with.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 7s is possible. I have one 8, so bidding 3 8s would be lower than the previous bid of 3 8s by Player 0, and therefore illegal. I have one 1, so bidding 1 1s would be a valid, but weak, bid. I also have two 4s, so bidding 2 4s is also possible. However, given the history of bids, and that Player 1 just bid 4 7s, it's likely there aren't many 7s in the remaining hands. Therefore, challenging seems like the best strategy.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I'm starting this round, so I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (52754537), I have two 5s, two 7s, one 4, one 3, and one 2. Since I have two 7s in my hand, and I previously won a challenge when I bid 4 7s (when the actual count was 5), I know there are at least 3 more 7s among the other players. However, one player has been eliminated, so the total count of 7s might be slightly lower now. Given my knowledge and the fact that I have two 7s myself, I'll start with a conservative bid of 3 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 7s by Player 1, I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Looking at my hand, 23054016, I have no 7s, which makes challenging more appealing since I have no direct evidence to support a higher bid on 7s. However, considering the game history and the fact that Player 2 was eliminated after challenging a bid of 4 7s which actually had 5 occurrences, it suggests that bids on higher digits might be more plausible due to the distribution of digits. Since I don't have enough information to make a confident bid on a higher digit without risking overestimation, and given that my hand doesn't support a bid on 7s directly, I must consider the likelihood of the current bid being true. Given that there are 40 digits in total and the bid is for 3 occurrences of a digit, it's not extremely high. Yet, without specific knowledge of other players' hands, making a higher bid could be risky. The fact that I have two 0s and other lower digits might suggest that bidding on those could be safer, but I need a digit that allows me to bid higher than 3 7s. Since I don't have a strong basis for a higher bid on a specific digit from my hand, and considering the strategic aspect of not wanting to overbid without solid evidence, challenging the current bid might be the safer option, especially since the last challenge on 4 7s resulted in the bidder winning, indicating that higher bids on certain digits might indeed be valid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I'm starting this round, so I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (52754537), I have two 5s, two 7s, one 2, one 3, and one 4. Since I have two 7s, and I've won previous challenges when bidding on 7s (suggesting other players also have 7s), this seems like a good digit to bid on. With 4 players having 8 digits each, there are 32 total digits in play. A conservative opening bid would be 3 7s, especially since I already know I have 2 of them in my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I hold two 2s in my hand. To beat the current bid of 3 7s, I can raise the quantity. With 24 unknown digits among the other three players, the expected number of 2s in those digits is about 2.4, so the probability that at least two more 2s exist is comfortably above 50%. This makes a bid of 4 2s reasonably safe while shifting play away from Player 1â€™s apparent strength in 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s made by Player 4. I have 8 secret digits: 60981938. I can see that I have one 6, one 9, one 8, one 3, and one 1. The digits 0, 2, 4, 5, and 7 are not visible in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 32 total digits remaining, I should consider the likelihood of the current bid being true. Since I do not have any 2s in my hand, and assuming the other players might have a few 2s, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems risky without more information. However, I can try to make an educated guess. I see I have one 8 and Player 0 bid 3 8s earlier. I could try bidding on 8s, considering I have one and it might be in other players' hands as well.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have 2 8s in my hand. Since the maximum quantity for any digit is 32, the bid seems possible.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand (52754537). The current bid is 6 7s. Looking at the history, I've previously bid 3 7s and 4 7s in earlier rounds, and when challenged on 4 7s, there were actually 5 7s total. Now we have fewer players (4 instead of 6 or 5), so there are fewer total digits. However, I still have my two 7s, and Player 0 has bid 6 7s, suggesting they might have several 7s themselves. Given that there were 5 7s when we had 5 players, and I still have my two 7s, it's plausible that there are at least 6 7s total even with fewer players. I could bid 7 7s, but that seems risky without more information. I could also switch to a different digit, like 7 0s or 6 8s, but I don't have strong evidence for those quantities. Given the uncertainty and the relatively high bid of 6 7s, challenging is the safer option.

Player 1 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (52754537), I have three 5s and two 7s. Since I have three 5s in my own hand, there could be more 5s in the other players' hands. This makes bidding on 5s a relatively safe option.

Player 4 Reasoning: I hold one 8. In the previous 4-player round Player 5 confidently bid 5 8s and was not challenged, which means there were at least five 8s among Players 0, 1, 4 and 5. Even if the eliminated Player 0 held several of those, it is still very plausible that Players 1 and 5 together keep at least two 8s. Combining those with my single 8 makes a total of three or more highly likely. Raising the digit to 8 while keeping the quantity at 3 is a strictly higher bid than 3 5s and should be safe from an immediate successful challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 4. I have the digits 6, 0, 9, 8, 1, 9, 3, and 8 in my hand, which means there are at least 3 8s in total (since I have two 8s). Given that the bid is 3 8s and it's my turn, I should make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. I can see that bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit could work. Since I have two 8s and the current bid is 3 8s, bidding 4 8s seems reasonable but risky if others have many 8s. Alternatively, I can bid with a different digit. I have three 9s, so bidding 3 9s would be a safe increase in digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have 8 digits in my hand: 52754537. Looking at my hand, I have zero 9s. The current bid is 3 9s from Player 5. With three players total, there are 24 total digits in play. For there to be 3 9s, both Player 4 and Player 5 would need to have some 9s in their hands. This is possible but not certain. Since I don't have any 9s myself, I'd need to increase the bid to either 4 of some digit or keep it at 3 but choose a digit higher than 9, which isn't possible. Looking at my hand, I have three 5s and three 7s, which are my strongest digits. However, I can't bid these as they need to be higher than the current bid. The safest option is to bid 4 of a digit I have multiple of. I have two 5s and three 7s, so bidding 4 5s or 4 7s would be risky as I'd be counting on other players having more. Given the previous rounds, 7s have been common, so I'll bid 4 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I see only one 7 in my own eight-digit hand. That means we would need at least three additional 7s among the 16 unknown digits held by Players 1 and 5 for the current bid of 4 7s to be correct. With each digit appearing with roughly 10 % probability, the expected number of 7s in those 16 digits is 1.6, and the chance that there are three or more is only about 21 %. Even if Player 1 happens to be slightly â€˜7-heavyâ€™, the likelihood that the total reaches four is still well under 50 %. Since any over-bid I could legally make (e.g., 4 8s, 5 2s, etc.) would be even less likely to be true and would invite an immediate challenge, the best move is to call Player 1 on what looks like an optimistic bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: As the opening bidder I want a statement that is guaranteed to be true from my perspective yet leaves plenty of room to react to later raises. I have exactly two 2s in my eight-digit hand (28712316). By bidding 2 2s I make a legal opening bid that cannot be wrong, so if Player 5 chooses to challenge immediately I am certain to win.

Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, I should consider the possibility of there being 2 2s. However, I also notice that bidding a higher quantity or digit could be advantageous. Since I have two 8s and the bid is for 2 2s, I could bid higher with a digit I have. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I can see only one 8 in my hand. For Player 5â€™s bid of 3 8s to be correct, they must be holding at least two 8s in their eight digits. Randomly, the likelihood of someone having two or more 8s in eight digits is below 20 %. Even assuming they chose a digit they have a pair of, the chance that they actually have the needed two 8s is still well under 50 %. Challenging therefore offers a better than even chance to win immediately, while any higher bid I could make (e.g., 4 2s or 4 1s) would be even less likely to stand if they challenge. Hence, the best move is to challenge.
