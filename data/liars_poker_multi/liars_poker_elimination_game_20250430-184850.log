Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid (Player 0). My hand is 41585575, which contains four 5s. This is a significant portion of the expected number of 5s across all 48 digits (which is 4.8). Given my strong holding of 5s, it's statistically probable that the total count of 5s is higher than average. I expect there to be roughly 4 more 5s among the other 40 digits. Bidding '6 5s' is a strong but reasonably safe opening bid, leveraging my hand's strength and assuming only 2 additional 5s exist among the other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 5s in my hand. With 48 digits total (40 unknown to me + my 8), the expected number of 5s is about 4.8 and the probability of seeing at least six 5s is under 25%. The current bid of 6 5s is unlikely, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and need to make the opening bid. My hand is 41585575, containing four 5s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. The expected average count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. Since I hold four 5s myself, it's highly probable that the total count of 5s is significantly higher than the average. The expected number of 5s among the other 4 players (32 digits) is 3.2, suggesting a total of around 7 5s. Last round (with 48 digits), my bid of 6 5s was exactly correct. Although there are fewer digits now (40), bidding 6 5s is still a strong and plausible opening move, given I possess 4 of the required 6. It leverages my hand's strength and puts pressure on the next player.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:5 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 27897259, which contains two 5s. The current bid by Player 0 is 6 5s across all 40 digits from the 5 active players. Since I have two 5s, that means the other four players must collectively have at least four 5s for the bid to hold, which is plausible (an average of 1 per player). However, given that this is the same bid Player 0 made in the previous round and it barely succeeded with exactly 6 5s, it’s risky to assume the count is still at least 6 with one player fewer. Still, challenging feels too uncertain without stronger evidence. I’ll make a higher bid instead, moving to 7 5s, as it’s a modest increase and keeps the pressure on while staying within a believable range based on my contribution.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 7 5s, which is already high. Given that there are 40 total digits and 5 players, the likelihood of there being 7 or more 5s is questionable. Since I don't have any 5s in my hand, I should challenge the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is None, and I have to make the first bid in this round. Looking at my hand (91498288), I have three 8s. Considering there are 4 players with 8 digits each, it's reasonable to assume that other players might have some 8s as well. Starting with a bid of 4 8s seems like a safe initial bid based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:4 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Player 3's bid of 4 8s requires at least four 8s total. My hand contains one 8, so there must be three 8s in the remaining 24 digits of three players. With an expected average of 2.4 8s in 24 digits, achieving three is plausible but not guaranteed. Given the close proximity to the expected average and the potential for bluffing, challenging the bid offers a reasonable chance of success if the actual count is below four.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have four 8s in my hand. Given that the current bid is None and I'm the first to bid in this round, I should start with a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 4 8s is safe since I already have four 8s, and there could be more in other players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:2 - gpt-4.1-2025-04-14) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand (44651779), making it less likely that there are 4 or more 8s among the 16 digits held by the other two players. Statistically, each digit is equally likely, so we'd expect about 1.6 occurrences of each digit per player (8 digits x 2 players x 1/10 = 1.6). For 8s to appear at least 4 times among the 16 unknown digits is somewhat unlikely, especially since I hold none. Given the previous challenge on 4 8s resulted in 5 actual 8s, but now with fewer digits in play, the probability is lower. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have four 8s in my hand (91498288). Since the current bid is None and I'm the first to bid in this round, I can start with a bid that reflects the strength of my hand. Bidding 4 8s is safe because I already have four 8s, and there's a chance the opponent has more. This sets a strong initial bid.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:1 - google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s by Player 3. I hold one 8 (41585575). For the bid to be true, Player 3 needs to hold at least three 8s out of their eight digits. While Player 3 has successfully bid 4 8s in previous rounds with more players, the total number of digits is now only 16. Relying on Player 3 having three or more 8s seems risky to challenge. My hand contains four 5s. Bidding 5 5s is a strong possibility. I only need Player 3 to hold one 5 for this bid to be true, which is statistically likely. This bid leverages my hand's strength and puts pressure on Player 3.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:3 - deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have four 8s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 5s. Since the previous bid was 4 8s, and Player 0 increased the quantity to 5 5s, I can either bid higher or challenge. Given that I have four 8s, it's possible there are more 8s in Player 0's hand. However, bidding 5 8s would be a significant jump based on my hand alone. Alternatively, challenging the 5 5s bid is risky because Player 0 might have some 5s. Given the uncertainty, I choose to challenge the bid of 5 5s, as it seems high given the history and my hand.
