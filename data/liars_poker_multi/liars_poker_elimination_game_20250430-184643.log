Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game, and I need to make a strategic opening. Looking at my hand (33564727), I have two 3s, one 5, one 6, one 4, one 7, and two 2s. Since I have two 3s and two 2s, these are good candidates for my bid. With 6 players having 8 digits each (48 total digits), and assuming a somewhat even distribution, each digit should appear around 4-5 times on average. I'll bid on 3s since I already know of two in my hand, making it a relatively safe opening bid. I'll go with a conservative quantity of 5, which means I need only 3 more 3s among the other 40 digits held by other players, which is quite reasonable.

Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand (14991930), I have two 1s, one 3, two 9s, one 4, and two 0s. The current bid is 5 3s. I have one 3, so it's likely there are more 3s among the other 40 cards. Statistically, each digit should appear about 4.8 times in 48 digits, so 5 3s is a reasonable opening bid. To keep the bidding moving safely, I will increase the digit to 5 4s, since I have one 4, making it plausible.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid of 5 4s is plausible, so challenging is risky. Itâ€™s valid to raise to the same quantity but a higher digit. With an expected 4.8 of any digit in 48 cards and two 8s in my hand, bidding 5 8s is a reasonable increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s by Player 2. I have only one 8 in my hand (from '57061950'), so the total number of 8s across all players is unlikely to reach 5. Given the total remaining digits are 48, and I have just one 8, it's improbable that the total count of 8s is 5 or more. Challenging now seems like the best move to test the bid's validity.

Player 3 Reasoning: The previous bid was 5 8s, which was challenged and found to be false (actual count was 2). Now, with no current bid and only 40 digits remaining among 5 players, I can safely bid higher to progress the game. My hand contains a '5' and an '8', so I have at least one of each. Bidding '6 8s' seems reasonable, as it slightly increases the quantity and leverages my knowledge of the 8s in my hand, making it a plausible bid without overcommitting.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains one 2, one 5, one 6, one 7, and four 4s. The current bid is 6 8s.  I have no 8s in my hand. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4. A bid of 6 8s, when I have none, seems somewhat high, but not impossible.  However, I have four 4s in my hand. Bidding on 4s seems like a safer bet than challenging a bid on a digit I don't have. I can bid 7 4s, which is higher than 6 8s (higher quantity).

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 4s. I have one 4 in my hand (from 22276131), so I know at least one 4 exists among my digits. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since there are 40 total digits and 7 4s have already been bid, it seems plausible that there could be more 4s or higher digits. I will increase the quantity to make a new bid. Bidding 8 4s is a reasonable next step as it is a higher quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 5's bid of 8 4s or make a higher bid. In my hand, I have one 4 (33564727). There are 5 active players with 8 digits each, totaling 40 digits. For there to be 8 4s in total, there would need to be 7 more 4s among the other players' hands. This means about 7/32 = 21.9% of the remaining digits would need to be 4s, which is significantly higher than the expected 10% for any single digit. However, it's not impossible. Looking at the bidding pattern, Player 4 bid 7 4s before Player 5 increased to 8 4s, suggesting they might have multiple 4s in their hands. Given I have only one 4, I'll make a higher bid. I can either bid 9 4s or switch to a higher digit. Since I have two 6s in my hand, I'll bid 8 6s, keeping the same quantity but using a higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand. The current bid is 8 6s, meaning there must be at least 8 occurrences of the digit 6 among the 40 digits in play. Since I have 0, that means the other 4 players' 32 digits must contain at least 8 6s, which is an average of 2 per player. This is above the expected average (32 digits / 10 = 3.2 per digit), making the bid fairly aggressive. Given the previous challenge succeeded on a much lower bid (5 8s with only 2 actual 8s found), and the fact that 6 is not a particularly common digit in my hand, I believe the bid is likely to be an overbid. Therefore, I will challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: As the first bidder this round, I should select a digit that I have multiple instances of to start with a safe and credible bid. My hand contains three 9s, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. Starting with a bid of 4 9s is reasonable: it's plausible given the distribution, not too aggressive, and puts some pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, and I need to bid higher. My hand contains the digits 5, 7, 0, 6, 1, 9, 5, 0, which means I have one 9. Since the total digits are 32, it's unlikely that there are 4 or more 9s across all players' hands, but I can still challenge or bid higher. Bidding 5 0s or 4 9s is risky; I have only one 9, so bidding 4 9s is unlikely. To increase the bid, I could bid 4 0s or 5 9s, but I only have one 9. Bidding 4 0s is safe but not higher than 4 9s. Bidding 5 9s is impossible with only one 9. Therefore, the best move is to challenge, as the count of 9s is unlikely to be 4 or more.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round with no current bid, I should make a strong opening bid based on my hand. My hand contains three 9s (1, 4, 9, 9, 1, 9, 3, 0), which is a high occurrence for a single digit. With three players and 24 digits in play, opening with 4 9s is credible and puts pressure on the opponents, given my demonstrated willingness to bid aggressively on 9s in the previous round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. My hand has zero 9s. With 3 players and 8 digits each, the maximum possible number of 9s is 24. A bid of 4 9s is exactly the actual count from the previous round, which Player 1 won. While it's possible there are still four 9s, it's also possible Player 1 is bluffing or the distribution has changed. Since I have no 9s, I cannot confidently bid higher on 9s. Bidding higher on another digit would require a significant jump in quantity or a high digit, and with only 24 total digits, a bid of 5 or more on any digit seems risky unless I have a strong hand in that digit. My hand has four 4s and one 5, one 6, one 7, one 2. Bidding 5 4s would be a valid bid and is supported by my hand, but it's a small increase from 4 9s. Given the previous challenge on 4 9s being successful for Player 1, it's plausible there are still 4 or more 9s. However, Player 1 was the one who bid 4 9s last round and won. They might be trying to repeat that. Challenging seems like a reasonable move here, as the bid is exactly the count from the previous round and I have no 9s to support a higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round. My hand contains one 5, one 2, one 6, and five 4s, one 7. I have five 4s. With 16 total digits, bidding 6 4s seems like a reasonable starting bid, slightly higher than my own count to account for the other player's hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. I have 8 digits: 22276131, which contains one '1', no '4's, and other digits. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since there are 16 digits in total and the current bid is 6 4s, it's plausible that there are 6 or more '4's. However, I don't have any '4's in my hand, which makes me slightly skeptical. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity (7 Xs) or the digit (6 Ys where Y > 4). Given my hand, I see that there are 3 '1's, 1 '2' (repeated three times, so 3 '2's), 1 '3', 1 '6', and 1 '7'. My hand doesn't directly influence my decision on '4's, but I can look for a reasonable next bid. Bidding 6 5s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit, and it's not directly contradicted by my hand. However, I should also consider the total count and the fact that there are only two players left.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 4s. I have 8 digits: 22276131, which contains one '4' and no higher digits than 4 that could be used to make a higher bid with the same quantity. To make a higher bid, I must increase the quantity. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and there are 16 digits in total. Bidding 8 4s is a valid higher bid. However, I should assess the likelihood of the current bid being true. Player 4 bid 7 4s, and I previously bid 6 5s. I have one '4', so Player 4 must have at least 6 '4's for the bid to be valid. Given that there are 16 digits in total and I have seen my hand, it's possible that Player 4 has a significant number of '4's. However, I can bid 8 4s, increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 4s. I have four 4s in my hand. With 16 total digits, an average distribution would be around 1.6 of each digit. A bid of 8 4s means Player 5 thinks there are at least four more 4s in their hand, which is possible but seems high given the average. However, challenging 8 4s when I have four 4s myself is risky. If Player 5 has four or more 4s, I lose. Bidding higher is also difficult; 8 5s is the next logical bid, but I only have one 5. Bidding 9 0s or higher is very speculative. Given my strong hand of 4s, it's more likely Player 5 also has a significant number of 4s, making the 8 4s bid plausible. Challenging feels too risky with my hand composition. The safest move is to bid higher, and 8 5s is the lowest valid bid, although I only have one 5. Bidding 9 of any digit is too speculative. Bidding 8 5s is the only reasonable bid based on the current bid and my hand, despite not having many 5s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 5s. I have the hand 22276131, which contains one 5 and one other digit (1, 2, 3, 6, 7) multiple times. I can count my own digits: there are 4 twos, 1 six, 1 three, and 1 one, and 1 seven. So, I have 0 5s in my hand. The total count for 5s must be at least my count (0) plus Player 4's count. For the bid 8 5s to be true, Player 4 must have at least 8 5s, which is highly unlikely since they have 8 digits. It's more probable that Player 4 is bluffing. I should challenge this bid as it's very unlikely to be true given the total number of digits remaining is 16 and I know I don't have any 5s.
