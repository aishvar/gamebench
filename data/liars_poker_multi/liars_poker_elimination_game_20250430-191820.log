Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make an opening bid. My hand is 39405206, which contains: 0 (2), 3 (1), 4 (1), 5 (1), 2 (1), 6 (2), 9 (1). Since 0 and 6 each appear twice, it's reasonable to open with a conservative bid on a digit I have multiple of. I'll start with '2 0s', which is a safe and standard opening bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Given that there are 6 players and each player has 8 digits, there are a total of 48 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. Since I only have one 0, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. I will bid 3 5s as I have two 5s in my hand and it seems like a safe increase.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. By raising from 3 5s to 3 9s, I increase the digit while keeping quantity the same. Only one additional nine among the other 40 digits is needed, which is extremely likely (~98.5%). This safe bid forces the next player to jump to quantity 4 if they want to continue.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 2. My hand contains zero 9s, which slightly decreases the perceived likelihood of the bid from my perspective. However, with 5 other players holding 40 digits, a count of three 9s is statistically quite possible (expected count is 4). Challenging carries risk (approx. 22% chance of winning based on random distribution). A safer strategy at this stage with 6 players is to make a valid higher bid. My hand contains two 4s. Bidding 4 4s is a valid higher bid (quantity 4 is greater than quantity 3) and is likely to be true, as I only need two more 4s from the remaining 40 digits across the other players (expected count of 4s among others is 4).

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have 8 digits: 34768196, which contains one 4. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I see one 4 in my hand, it's possible that there are at least 4 fours in total among all players. However, bidding more than 4 fours might be too aggressive without more information. I can increase the digit to make a higher bid. Bidding 4 5s is a reasonable next step as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '4 5s'. Looking at my hand (18172561), I have one 5. Since there are 6 active players with 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For the bid of '4 5s' to be valid, there need to be at least 4 fives among all players. I already have 1 five, so there would need to be at least 3 more fives among the other players' hands, which is quite possible. Player 1 initially bid '3 5s', suggesting they might have some fives. Given this, challenging seems risky. I'll make a higher bid instead. I have two 1s and one 7, so I could bid '4 7s' (same quantity, higher digit) based partially on my own hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 2, and two 6s in my hand, but no 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, which is plausible since there are 48 digits in play, and it's not an outrageous bid. However, since I have two 6s, I can safely increase the bid to 4 6s, which is a legal and safe move, as there may be more 6s among the other players.

Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (39405206), I have two 0s, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, and two 9s. The current bid is 4 7s. Since I have no 7s, I can't be confident in challenging yet, as 4 out of 48 isn't unreasonable. To maintain a safe position, I'll increment the digit to 8 (which is higher than 7) while keeping the quantity at 4. This is a legal and safe minimal raise.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 0. I have one 8 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have multiple 8s, I will increase the digit. Bidding 4 9s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and I have a 9 in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 9s, so bidding 5 9s means I need just three more among the 40 unknown digits. With an expected 4 9s in those 40, a bid of 5 9s has about a 78% chance of being valid. Challenging 4 9s is too risky given its plausibility, so I will raise to 5 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. With 48 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 4.8. The bid of 5 is very close to this expected value, making a challenge risky. I have two 0s in my hand. To make a valid bid higher than 5 9s, I must bid at least 6 of any digit. Bidding 6 0s requires 4 more 0s from the remaining 40 digits held by other players. The expected number of 0s among the other 40 digits is 40 * 0.1 = 4. Therefore, bidding 6 0s is a bid right at the expected total count (my 2 + 4 others = 6), which is a statistically sound and plausible move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have one 6 and no 0s in my hand. Given that there are 48 total digits and 6 players, a bid of 6 0s implies an average of 1 '0' per player. It's plausible that other players have more '0's than I do. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have any 0s, I will increase the digit. Bidding 6 1s is a valid higher bid as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (18172561), I have two 1s. The current bid is 6 1s from Player 4. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For there to be at least 6 1s, the other players would need to have at least 4 more 1s among them. This is certainly possible, especially since Player 4 confidently bid 6 1s - they likely have some 1s in their hand. I could challenge, but it's a risky move given that I already have 2 of the 6 needed 1s. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity to 7 1s or keep the quantity at 6 but increase the digit. Since I'm not confident there are 7 1s, I'll bid 6 2s. I have one 2 in my hand, so I'm contributing to this count.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 39405206, which contains: 3 (1), 9 (1), 4 (1), 0 (2), 5 (1), 2 (1), 6 (1). So I have one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 6 2s. On average, each digit appears about 4.8 times across all hands (48 digits, 10 digits), so 6 is slightly above average. Since I only have one 2, at least five more must be distributed among the other 40 cards, which is plausible. However, it is not extremely likely. To avoid a risky challenge, I can make a safe, minimal higher bid: 6 3s (same quantity, next higher digit). I have one 3, and 6 3s is not unreasonable at this stage.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s made by Player 0. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than 6 3s. I have the digits 4, 5, 8, 5, 7, 9, 6, 2 in my hand. I can see that bidding a higher quantity with a lower digit or the same quantity with a higher digit is possible. Since I have two 5s and the previous bid was 6 3s, I can bid 7 5s which is higher in quantity.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have only one 5 in my hand, so for the bid of 7 5s to be true there must be at least six 5s among the other 40 digits. The expected number of 5s in 40 random digits is 4 and the probability of getting six or more is only about 20%. This makes the current bid unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. With 40 total digits, the expected count of any digit is 4, and bidding 3 9s requires only one more 9 among the 32 unknown digits, which is highly likely (~97%). Starting at 3 9s is a safe opening bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand (75044830) contains zero 9s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 4. Challenging 3 9s seems risky as 3 is below the expected value, making it likely to be true or close to true. I need to make a higher bid. My hand has two 0s and two 4s, providing support for bidding on these digits. Bidding 4 0s (or 4 4s) is a valid higher bid (increasing quantity from 3 to 4). I have 2 0s, needing 2 more from the other 4 players (32 digits). The expected number of 0s from others is 3.2, so finding 2 more is reasonable. The game history shows Player 0 bid 6 0s in the previous round, suggesting they might hold several 0s, which could support a bid on 0s. Bidding 4 0s is a well-supported and valid move.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s made by Player 3. I have one 0 in my hand (34768196). To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll analyze my hand and the current state. My hand has digits ranging from 1 to 9, with no 0s except none, actually I have none. The total count of 0s across all players must be at least the count in my hand (0) plus the count in other hands. Given that there are 4 other players and each has 8 digits, it's possible that there are 4 0s in total if all other players have at least one 0. However, bidding more than the current quantity without strong evidence might be risky. I can bid 4 1s, keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit, which is a valid higher bid according to the rules. My hand has one 1, so it's plausible that the total count of 1s could be around 4 or more across all players.

Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. In my hand, I have one 1 (in 18172561). The current bid is 4 1s, which means Player 4 is claiming there are at least 4 ones across all 5 players' hands (40 total digits). Given that I have one 1, there would need to be at least 3 more 1s among the other 32 digits held by other players. This is certainly possible. Looking at my other options, I have two 1s, one 2, no 3s, no 4s, one 5, two 6s, two 7s, and one 8. I could bid 4 2s, but I only have one 2 in my hand, making it risky. I could bid 5 1s, but again, I only have one 1. I could also bid 4 6s, as I have two 6s, making it more likely to succeed. Since 4 1s seems reasonable and I don't have strong evidence to challenge, I'll make a higher bid with 4 6s, which I have better support for in my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 39405206, which contains two 0s and two 6s. The current bid is 4 6s. With 5 players and 40 digits in play, the average count for any digit is about 4. I already have two of the 6s, so it is plausible that there are at least two more among the other 32 digits. However, I can't be sure. Since I hold a strong portion of the 6s and the bid is not overly aggressive, I will make a conservative higher bid by increasing the digit to 4 7s, which is the minimum legal bid and keeps pressure on the table.

Since I don't have many 9s, I'll consider bidding on a higher digit. I have multiple digits available, so I can bid 3 on a higher digit than 9, which is not possible, or increase the quantity. I can bid 4 on a lower or the same digit. Given my hand (34768196), I see I have a 6 and other digits but no 9s other than one. I can safely bid 4 on a digit I have or a slightly higher one if I think it's likely. I'll choose to bid 4 6s as it seems reasonable given my hand and the need to exceed the current bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (18172561), I have one 6. Player 4 has bid 4 6s, meaning they believe there are at least 4 sixes among all players. Since I have 1 six, that means there would need to be at least 3 more sixes among the other 3 players. With 8 digits per player and 4 players total, there are 32 total digits. The probability of having a specific digit is roughly 1/10, so we'd expect about 3.2 sixes total. Given that I already have 1 six, expecting 3 more among 24 remaining digits from other players is slightly above average but reasonable. I could bid 4 7s (I have one 7), 4 8s (no 8s in my hand), 5 0s, 5 1s (I have two 1s), or 5 6s. Since I have two 1s in my hand, bidding 5 1s seems most reasonable based on my knowledge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I'm starting this round with my hand containing 18172561. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, one 8, one 7, one 2, one 5, one 6, and no 0s, 3s, 4s, or 9s. Since I'm the first to bid in this round, I should make a strategic opening bid. I want to bid on a digit I have multiple of, so bidding on 1s makes sense since I have two of them. For the quantity, I'll start conservatively with 3 1s, assuming the other players might have at least one more 1 between them. This is a reasonable opening bid that gives me some flexibility for future rounds.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 9s. To make 3 9s, only one more is needed among the 16 unknown digits, which has about an 81.5% chance. This is a strong, plausible bid and it’s strictly higher than 3 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have the digits 34768196, which means I have no 9s. The total count of 9s across all players must be at least from Player 2 and Player 5. Given that there's a total of 24 digits and the distribution is across 3 players, a bid of 3 9s seems relatively low but plausible if the other players have 9s. However, I can bid higher. I can see that I have one 6 and no 9s, but I can still make a higher bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 3 8s or 4 1s would be a valid higher bid. Since I have multiple digits and can see the potential for a higher count in other digits, I'll choose to bid 4 1s as it's a reasonable increase and I have one 1 in my hand, making it somewhat plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (18172561), I have two 1s. Player 4 has bid 4 1s, meaning they believe there are at least 4 ones across all players' hands. Since I have 2 of them, that means they're claiming there are at least 2 more ones between themselves and Player 2. This is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's a risky move since the bid is quite reasonable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have one 5 and one 6 in my hand. I'll bid 4 5s, which is higher than 4 1s because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity. This is somewhat speculative since I only have one 5, but it's a safer move than challenging the reasonable 4 1s bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand and would need at least three more among the other 16 unknown cards. Even with a uniform distribution, the chance of seeing three or more 5s is only about 20%, so the bid of 4 5s is unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand and by opening with two 9s I guarantee the bid is true based on my cards. My opponent, if they hold no 9s (about a 43% chance), will likely challenge and lose immediately; if they hold at least one 9 they’ll be reluctant to challenge. This makes “2 9s” the strongest safe opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have the digits 34768196, which means I have no 9s. With 16 total digits remaining and Player 2 having 8 digits, the maximum number of 9s I can expect is 8 (if Player 2 had all 9s). The probability of having exactly 2 or more 9s is low since it is less than half of 8. However, I should consider the fact that Player 2 made this bid, possibly indicating they have at least one 9. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 2 8s or lower is not allowed, so I must bid at least 3 0s or 2 As (but 'As' is not a valid term, so it should be a digit). Given my hand, I have one 6 and other scattered digits. I can bid 3 0s or higher valid bid. Since I have a 6 and a couple of other low digits, and no 9s, I think bidding 3 6s is reasonable as it increases the quantity and is based on having a 6 in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I only have one 6 in my hand. To satisfy the bid of 3 6s, Player 4 must have at least two 6s among their 8 cards, which is unlikely (under 20% chance). It’s more likely a bluff, so I should challenge.
