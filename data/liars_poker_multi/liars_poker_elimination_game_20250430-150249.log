Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand (00063349), I have three 0s, one 6, one 3, two 4s, and one 9. Since I have three 0s in my hand, I can confidently bid at least that many. With 6 players having 8 digits each (48 total digits), it's likely there are more 0s among other players. A conservative opening bid would be to claim there are at least 5 0s in total, which is reasonable given I already have 3 of them.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 0s (digits: 1, 0, 6, 4, 0, 1, 6, 3). With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits in total. The current bid is 5 0s. Statistically, each digit appears about 4.8 times on average, so 5 0s is a reasonable opening bid. Since I have two 0s myself, it's plausible that there are at least 5 zeros in total. To keep the pressure on and maintain flexibility, I will make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit to 5 1s, since I have two 1s in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I must raise by either increasing quantity or, with the same quantity, choosing a higher digit. My hand contains three 6s (62455662). To satisfy a bid of 5 6s, only two more 6s are needed among the 40 unknown digits held by the other five players. With each digit having a 10% chance of being a 6, the probability of there being at least two additional 6s is well above 90%, making this a strong, safe raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. My hand is 78339214. I have one 1, one 2, two 3s, one 4, one 7, one 8, and one 9. I have no 6s.  With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8 (48 / 10 digits). A bid of 5 for any digit is slightly above average but not unreasonable. However, since I have no 6s, and the bid is already 5 6s, raising the bid on 6s is risky.  Looking at my hand, I have two 3s. Bidding 6 3s is a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity based on my hand's strength in 3s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. Bidding higher than 6 3s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 7 3s seems risky given I have no 3s. Increasing the digit to 6 4s is a reasonable option, as I have two 4s. Similarly, 6 5s is also an option, as I have one 5. I will bid 6 4s as it is a slight increase in digit and I have two 4s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. My hand contains two 5s, one 4, and other digits. Bidding 6 5s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is valid. Given that I have two 5s, it's plausible there are at least six 5s across all hands. Challenging the 6 4s bid carries risk since I hold one 4, and others could have five. Bidding 6 5s is a safer, higher bid based on my hand's 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of '6 5s'. Looking at my hand (00063349), I have zero 5s. The current bid claims there are at least 6 fives among all players. With 6 players total and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. Since I have zero 5s, the other 5 players would need to have at least 6 fives among them, which is certainly possible (averaging just over 1 five per player). The bidding so far has been relatively conservative, with quantities only reaching 6. I could bid '6 6s', which would be higher than '6 5s' because of the higher digit. I have one 6 in my hand, so I'd be claiming there are at least 5 more among the other players, which seems reasonable. Alternatively, I could bid '7 0s' since I have two 0s in my hand, but that's riskier as it increases the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. In my hand (10640163), I have two 6s. With 48 digits in play and 6 players, the average number of any digit per player is about 4.8, so for any specific digit, the expected count is about 4.8 across all hands. A bid of 6 is slightly above average, but not unreasonable. However, since I hold two 6s, it's plausible that the total number of 6s could reach or exceed 6. Therefore, challenging now is risky. The next legal bid is 6 7s, but I have only one 7. Bidding 7 0s is possible, as I have two 0s and 0s may be underbid. However, without strong evidence that there are at least 7 of any digit, the safest course is to increment the digit and bid 6 7s, keeping the bid alive without escalating the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The bid claims there are at least six 7s among all 48 digits. I hold zero 7s, so the other 40 unseen digits would need to supply all six. With a uniform distribution, the expected number of 7s in 40 digits is 4; the probability of there being 6 or more is a bit over 20%. That makes the bid unlikely to be true, giving me favorable odds to win by challenging.

Player 2 Reasoning: I am the first to bid this round. In my hand I hold three 6s. With 32 unknown digits still in play, the expected number of additional 6s is about 3 (32 Ã— 0.1), giving roughly a 60-65% chance that there are at least six 6s in total. Opening with 6 6s leverages my strong holding while setting a reasonably challenging bar for the other players without being overly risky.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. A bid of 6 6s is already above average. However, the previous round saw bids go up to 6 7s, indicating some players might have a concentration of certain digits. Given my hand has two 3s, two 8s, and one 7, I could potentially bid higher on those. Bidding 7 3s or 7 8s seems plausible based on my hand and the possibility of others having some. Bidding 7 3s is a slightly higher bid than 6 6s and I have two 3s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. Bidding higher than 7 of any digit is risky with only 40 total digits remaining. I have two 7s, two 5s, two 4s, one 2, and one 7. Bidding 8 7s is possible but feels too aggressive. I think challenging is the best option, as 7 3s is a relatively high number and I have no 3s to contribute. It's likely the bid is an overestimation.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None'. I have two 4s and two 5s in my hand. Given the previous rounds, players are bidding relatively high. Starting with 7 4s seems like a reasonable, conservative bid, leveraging the 4s I hold. It's higher than any previous bids from the last round and doesn't seem overly aggressive given the number of digits remaining (32).

Player 5 Reasoning: As the first to bid in this round, I need to start with a reasonable bid based on my hand. My hand contains two 5s, so bidding 3 5s is plausible, assuming at least one more 5 exists in the other players' hands. This bid is conservative and leverages my existing digits, making it less likely to be immediately challenged.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have 0 5s in my hand. With 3 players having 8 digits each, there are 24 total digits in play. Player 5 has bid 3 5s, which means they're claiming there are at least 3 5s among all players. Since I have 0 5s, all 3 would need to come from the other two players. This is possible but not guaranteed. Looking at my hand (00063349), I have three 0s, which gives me confidence to bid 4 0s. This is a higher quantity than the current bid and is supported by what I know I have.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I hold three 6s (6,6,6) in my eight-digit hand. If I bid 4 6s, I need only one additional 6 among the 16 unknown digits held by Players 0 and 5. The chance that at least one of those 16 digits is a 6 is 1 âˆ’ 0.9^16 â‰ˆ 81%, giving my bid a strong likelihood of being valid if itâ€™s challenged. Challenging the current bid of 4 0s is tempting, but if Player 0 happens to have three 0s, the bid would still succeed, giving me roughly a 20% chance of elimination. Raising to 4 6s both lowers my personal risk and forces the others to decide whether to take on an 81% favorite or push the bid higher.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s by Player 2. Bidding 5 5s increases the quantity (5 > 4) while leveraging my own 5s. Since I have two 5s, it's plausible the total across all players meets or exceeds five, making this a defensible higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the situation carefully. Player 5 has bid 5 5s, meaning they claim there are at least 5 fives among all 24 digits in play. Looking at my own hand (00063349), I have zero 5s. For Player 5's bid to be true, there would need to be 5 fives between Player 2 and Player 5's hands (16 digits total). This is possible but somewhat unlikely. Player 5 previously bid 3 5s, suggesting they might have at least 2-3 fives themselves. I could challenge, but it's risky. Alternatively, I could bid higher. My options are to bid 5 6s or higher quantity like 6 of any digit. Since I have one 6 in my hand, bidding 5 6s is safer than challenging. I also have three 0s, but bidding 6 0s would be quite aggressive given I'd need 3 more from other players.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold three 6s. To satisfy Player 0â€™s bid of 5 6s, the remaining 16 unseen digits (those of Players 0 and 5) must contain at least two more 6s. With a 10% chance per digit, the expected number of 6s in those 16 digits is 1.6, and the probability that there are two or more is under 50%. If I tried to out-bid (e.g., 6 6s), Iâ€™d need at least three additional 6s in the other handsâ€”only about a 20% chanceâ€”and that bigger, riskier bid would almost certainly be challenged by Player 5. Challenging now gives me the better odds of success.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand and no 6s. The current bid is 3 6s. Bidding 4 5s increases the quantity while targeting a digit I have, making it a safer move than challenging. Since I have two 5s, there's a reasonable chance Player 2 has at least two more to meet the 4-5s threshold. Challenging 3 6s carries higher risk due to uncertainty about Player 2's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 5s. Player 5 has repeatedly favoured the digit 5 and was willing to bid as high as 5 5s earlier when there were 24 digits in play, so it is very plausible they have at least three 5s in their unchanged eight-digit hand. That would make the total at least the five required. Challenging their current bid of 4 5s is therefore too risky, while raising the bid to 4 6s would almost certainly be challenged and fail because the earlier reveal showed there is at most one 6 in Player 5â€™s hand. Increasing the quantity on the same digit is the safest advance and forces Player 5 either to accept a higher risk or to change digits, where I may be able to trap them on a later challenge.
