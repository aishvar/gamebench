Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can make a conservative opening bid. I have two 7s in my hand, so I'll bid a small number of 7s to start.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 4 7s increases the quantity, assuming other players may have additional 7s. This is a logical progression from the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand is 64905919. I have zero 7s. The average expected count for 7s among the other 5 players is 40 / 10 = 4. The current bid is exactly this average, making it plausible but not certain. Challenging is risky as it's a coin flip around the average. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains three 9s. Bidding 4 9s requires only one more 9 from the other 5 players (who have 40 digits). The average expected count for 9s among the other players is 40 / 10 = 4. It is highly probable that at least one of the other 5 players has a 9. Bidding 4 9s is a safe and valid bid based on my strong holding of 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 9s is possible. I could bid 5 0s, 5 1s, etc. or 4 of any digit higher than 9 which is impossible. I have one 8, so bidding 5 8s is risky but plausible. However, given the previous bids of 3 7s and 4 7s, and the fact that I have no 9s, it's unlikely that there are 4 9s in total. Challenging seems like the best option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round and must make a valid bid. My hand contains three 9s, which is the most frequent digit I hold. There are 40 total digits across 5 players, meaning the average expected count for any digit is 4. Bidding 5 9s leverages the strength of my hand (3 9s) and requires only two more 9s to be present among the other 32 digits, which is a reasonably likely outcome (probability > 80%). This sets a strong but not overly aggressive baseline for the round.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:5 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. My hand contains one 9, making it uncertain whether the total 9s across all players meet the bid. However, challenging a bid of 5 9s is risky because the total digits (40) and previous round's 9s count (8 in 48 digits) suggest 5 is plausible. Instead, I will make a safer higher bid by incrementing the quantity to 6 and using a digit I have more of in my hand (two 0s). Bidding 6 0s is a valid increase and leverages my known digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid of 6 0s means there need to be at least 5 more 0s among the other 32 digits I can't see. While possible, this seems quite high given that Player 4 jumped straight to 6 0s. Looking at the game history, Player 2's previous bid of 4 9s was actually true with 8 nines existing, suggesting players might have clustered digits. However, since I only see one 0 and the bid is relatively high at 6, challenging seems like the safer play.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:5 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: As the starting player, I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 0s and two 8s. Bidding 3 0s is reasonable because I have two, and there's a good chance at least one other player has a 0. This is a conservative opening bid that balances my known digits with the likelihood of others holding similar digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. I could bid 3 1s, but I'm going to bid 4 0s to try and push the count up, as 3 0s seems relatively low for 32 total digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid is 4 0s. Bidding 4 3s is a valid higher bid as it maintains the same quantity but increases the digit.

Player 1 bids: 4 3s

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:4 - openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. My hand contains zero 3s, suggesting this bid might be slightly high, as it requires at least four 3s to be present among the other 24 digits. While challenging is an option with a potentially favorable probability (based on average distribution), it carries the risk of elimination. My hand contains three 9s. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is very likely to be true, as I only need one more 9 from the remaining 24 digits held by other players. This is a safer strategic move that leverages my strong hand and keeps me in the game.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:5 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, so the remaining three players must have at least three 9s for the bid to be true. Bidding 5 8s increases the quantity while leveraging my two 8s. This creates a plausible higher bid, as 8 is a common digit and others may hold additional 8s. Challenging carries risk since even if the count is exactly 4, the bidder wins. A bid maintains control and pressures opponents to either match or challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 6 8s would be a valid increase. Given the game history, bids have been relatively conservative, and I don't want to risk an early challenge. I will bid 6 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. My hand contains no 8s, and with 32 total digits remaining, it's unlikely there are 6 8s across all players. Challenging this bid is a reasonable risk given the low probability of the bid being true.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid of 3 3s, which is a reasonable estimate based on my hand and the total digits remaining.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 64905919, containing three 9s. The current bid is 3 3s. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the expected count for any digit is 2.4. I already hold 3 9s, meaning the other 16 digits are expected to contain 1.6 more 9s, for a total expected count of 4.6. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid that is strongly supported by my hand and the overall probabilities. It's a reasonable step up from 3 3s and leverages my most abundant digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand and one 9. The current bid is 4 9s. Bidding 5 8s increases the quantity while leveraging my existing 8s. With 24 total digits, it's plausible others hold enough 8s to meet this bid. Challenging the current bid risks elimination if there are indeed four 9s (possible if opponents have three 9s between them). Bidding provides a safer path while maintaining pressure.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. My hand contains two 9s, which suggests that bidding 5 9s (same quantity but higher digit) is a valid and strategic move. This increases the bid without requiring more than my current hand's potential. Challenging might be risky if the actual count of 8s is indeed 5 or more, but bidding 5 9s leverages my existing digits and follows the rules for a higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:4 - openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I hold three 9s in my hand. There are 24 total digits among 3 players. For the bid of 5 9s to be true, the remaining 16 digits held by Player 1 and Player 4 must contain a total of at least 5 - 3 = 2 nines. Based on probability (Binomial distribution B(16, 0.1)), the chance of getting 0 or 1 nine in 16 digits is approximately 51.5%, meaning the chance of getting 2 or more nines is approximately 48.5%. Therefore, it is slightly more likely that the actual count of 9s is less than 5, making the bid false. Bidding higher, such as 6 0s or 6 9s, appears statistically less likely to be true based on my hand and the remaining digits. Challenging the bid of 5 9s offers a slightly better than 50% chance of winning.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s by Player 1. I have one 9 in my hand. Challenging the bid gives me a 43% chance of winning if Player 1 has no 9s. However, bidding 3 8s is more strategically advantageous. I have two 8s, and there's a 57% chance Player 1 has at least one 8, making the total 3. This bid increases both quantity and is supported by my hand. Bidding 3 8s is more likely to be true than challenging the current bid, which has a lower probability of failure.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s. The current bid is 3 8s. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid since the digit is higher while maintaining the same quantity. This leverages my existing 9s and challenges the current bid without risking a direct challenge on 8s, which I have none of.
