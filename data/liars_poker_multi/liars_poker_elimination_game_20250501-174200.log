Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since I'm the first to bid, I need to make a strategic opening bid. Looking at my hand (90272336), I have two 3s, which is a good starting point. In a game with 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. The average count for any digit would be 4.8 (48 รท 10), so bidding slightly below that is reasonable. Given that I already have two 3s in my hand, I'll bid 4 3s, which means I'm betting there are at least 2 more 3s among the other players' hands. This is a conservative yet strategic opening bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s, meaning there are at least four 3s among all players' hands. I have one '3' in my hand, so the bid is plausible but not certain. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. Increasing to 4 4s is the next valid bid. I have one '4' in my hand, which supports bidding 4 4s. Since the bid of 4 3s is not obviously false, I will make a higher bid rather than challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s made by Player 1. I have the digits 7, 2, 5, 5, 9, 8, 8, 9 in my hand, which includes two 5s, two 8s, and two 9s. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. The bid must be strictly higher than 4 4s. I can bid 4 5s as my quantity is the same but my digit (5) is higher than 4. Alternatively, I could try to increase the quantity if I think the digit is likely to be common enough.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s. Bidding 4 6s continues the pattern of increasing the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which aligns with my hand and the previous bidding trend.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge. Looking at my hand (70729217), I have zero 6s. The current bid is '4 6s', meaning Player 3 claims there are at least 4 sixes among all 48 digits. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. Since I have no 6s, the other 5 players would need to have at least 4 sixes among their 40 digits. This is certainly possible (about 1 six per 10 digits on average). I could bid '4 7s', but I only have one 7 in my hand. I could bid '5 0s', '5 1s', '5 2s', or '5 7s' based on what I have, but increasing the quantity makes the bid riskier. Since I have two 2s, bidding '5 2s' seems reasonable. I also have two 7s, so '5 7s' would be another option. I'll go with '5 7s' since it's a higher digit and I have two of them in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 and one 4 in my hand, and the previous round's bids reached 5 8s before elimination. Starting with a moderate bid like 3 5s is reasonable to test the waters without overcommitting, as it is higher than no bid and sets a baseline for others.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 1. I have two 5s in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 secret digits, there are a total of 40 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Since I have two 5s, I will assume that other players might have at least one 5. Bidding 4 5s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity from the current bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand (digits: 81267364). The current bid is 4 5s. Bidding 4 6s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) based on my confidence in having multiple 6s, which increases the likelihood of meeting or exceeding this bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge Player 3's bid of '4 6s'. Looking at my hand (70729217), I have zero 6s. Since I have no 6s in my hand, for Player 3's bid to be valid, there need to be at least 4 sixes among the other 4 players' 32 digits. While this is certainly possible, I do have a high number of 7s in my hand (three 7s). Given that I have three 7s, I can confidently bid '5 7s', which is higher than the current bid and leverages my strong hand. This is a safer move than challenging, as the probability of having 4 sixes among 32 digits is reasonable.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 5 7s, which requires at least five 7s across all players. Since I hold two 7s, bidding 6 7s increases the quantity, making it a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 7s while pushing the bid higher.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. With 40 digits total among all players, 6 occurrences of digit 7 is plausible but somewhat high. Since I only have one 7, increasing the quantity further might be risky. However, I can raise the bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Bidding 6 8s is a valid increment and slightly more challenging for others. I have one 8 in my hand as well, making this a reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s made by Player 1. I have 3 eights in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 secret digits, there are a total of 40 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. The bid of 6 8s seems plausible but I need to assess if it's likely or not. With my hand and the need for a higher bid, I should consider if I can make a valid higher bid or challenge. Since my hand contains 3 eights, I know there are at least 3 eights in total. However, bidding higher requires a strategic decision based on the likelihood of the current bid being true or false.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid of 7 8s requires at least 7 eights in total across 5 players (40 digits). Statistically, the expected number of eights is 4 (40 * 10% average probability). With only one 8 in my hand, the remaining 32 digits (other players) would need at least 6 eights to meet the bid, which is highly improbable. Challenging this bid leverages the low likelihood of such a high count.

Player 4 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (70729217), I have zero 6s. Player 3 has bid 4 6s, claiming there are at least 4 sixes among all 32 digits. Since I have none, all 4 would need to come from the other 3 players (who have 24 digits total). This is certainly possible but not guaranteed. However, I have three 7s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid 5 7s. This is a safe increase over the current bid and leverages my strong holding in 7s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. With 32 total digits remaining and my hand containing two 7s, the likelihood of there being at least 5 7s across all players is low.

Since I have two 7s, I know there are at least two 7s in the game. Given that there are 3 players with 8 digits each (24 total digits), a conservative opening bid would be reasonable. I'll bid 3 7s since I already have two 7s in my hand, making it likely there's at least one more 7 among the other 16 digits held by my opponents.

In previous rounds, Player 3 bid 4 6s twice, suggesting they likely have some 6s in their hand. However, since I have zero 6s, and there are only 24 total digits remaining among 3 players, Player 3 and Player 1 would need to have at least 4 sixes between them. This is possible but not guaranteed. I could bid higher, such as 4 7s (I have two 7s in my hand) or 5 0s (I have one 0). However, given that I have no 6s at all, challenging seems like the better option. If Player 3 and Player 1 combined have fewer than 4 sixes, I'll win the challenge.

Since I'm starting the bidding, I should make a strategic first bid. I can see I have two 7s in my hand, which is a good start. A reasonable opening bid would be 3 7s, suggesting there's at least one more 7 in Player 1's hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze whether to make a higher bid or challenge Player 1's bid of 3 8s. Looking at my hand (70729217), I have only 1 eight. Since there are only 16 total digits in play (8 from me and 8 from Player 1), and I know I have 1 eight, that means Player 1 would need to have at least 2 eights for their bid to be valid. While this is possible, it's not guaranteed. However, I need to make a strategic decision. I could bid 4 0s, 4 1s, 4 2s, etc., or challenge. Since I have two 7s in my hand, I could reasonably bid 4 7s. But given that I've already shown a preference for 7s in previous rounds, Player 1 might suspect I have multiple 7s. I'll bid 4 0s instead, as I have one 0 in my hand, making it somewhat credible while avoiding revealing too much about my hand composition.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s, which means at least four zeros between both players' hands. I have one 0 in my hand, so there must be at least three zeros in Player 4's hand to meet this bid. Given the rarity of zeros and the bid being only four, it seems plausible. I can increase the bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I have one 5 in my hand and previously the bids have gone up to 4 0s. I will increase the quantity to 5 and keep the digit at 0, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze whether to challenge Player 1's bid of 5 0s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (70729217), I have only 1 zero. For Player 1's bid to be valid, they would need to have at least 4 zeros in their hand. With only 8 digits per player, having 4 or more of the same digit is possible but somewhat unlikely. In previous rounds, I've shown a tendency to bid on 7s (which I have 2 of in my hand), and Player 1 has shown a preference for 8s (which I have 1 of). Since I'm not confident Player 1 has 4 zeros, and the bid is already at a high quantity (5 out of 16 possible digits), challenging seems reasonable. If I'm wrong, I lose, but if I'm right, I win the game since we're the last two players.
