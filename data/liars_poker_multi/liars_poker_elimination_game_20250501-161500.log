Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid. My hand is 01463761, which contains two 6s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected average count of any digit is 4.8. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable opening bid, close to the expected value and supported by having two 6s in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 5s and one 6 in my hand. Given that there are 48 digits remaining, it's reasonable to assume that there are at least 4 of some digits still in play. Since I have a 6, bidding 4 7s is a safe and strategic move, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 1. My hand contains one 7. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 5 7s would be a reasonable increase in quantity, but given that I only have one 7, it might not be the best strategy. Alternatively, bidding 4 8s would increase the digit, which seems more feasible and strategic given my hand contains an 8.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits. The expected number of any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8. The bid of 4 8s is below the statistical average. I hold one 8 (in 32073184), meaning only 3 more 8s are needed among the other 40 digits (5 players * 8 digits). The expected number of 8s in those 40 digits is 40 / 10 = 4. Therefore, the bid of 4 8s is quite likely to be true, making a challenge risky. I should bid higher. My options are 4 9s or starting with quantity 5 (e.g., 5 0s). I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 5 3s is a relatively safe option, as I contribute two towards the required five, needing only three more from the remaining 40 digits, which is below the expected average of 4 for those digits.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains a 4, and the current bid is 5 3s. Bidding 5 4s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing digits without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding higher requires me to estimate the number of 4s other players might have. Given the previous bids of 4 6s, 4 7s, 4 8s, and 5 3s, it seems unlikely that there are 6 or more 4s total. Challenging the bid seems like the most logical play as I have no 4s and the bid seems relatively high. The maximum possible 4s is 8 (one from each player), and 5 is a reasonable number, but worth challenging given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. My hand contains two 6s. Bidding 5 6s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Based on my two 6s, I only need three more 6s among the remaining 32 digits held by other players to support this bid, which is very close to the average expectation (32 / 10 = 3.2). Challenging 5 5s is risky as I have no 5s, and the other 4 players could easily hold 5 or more 5s among their 32 digits. Bidding 5 6s is a reasonable and supportable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s and two 4s in my hand. The last bid was 5 6s, so I need to bid higher. Since I have two 5s, it's likely that there are at least 7 5s in total, so I can safely bid 7 5s, which is a higher quantity than the current bid. I could also bid 5 7s, but I only have one 7, making that riskier. Bidding 7 5s seems like the best move.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 5s made by Player 1. I have the hand 84860315, which contains one 5. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total number of digits is 40. The bid of 7 5s seems high but not impossible. However, I must consider my own hand and the potential distribution of digits among other players. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should evaluate the feasibility of the current bid. With one 5 in my hand and a total of 40 digits, if the other players have a reasonable distribution, 7 5s could be possible but seems a bit high. I will make a higher bid by increasing the quantity because I have to bid higher than 7 5s and I do not have enough high digits to confidently bid on a higher digit.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:3 - google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 5s. There are 40 total digits, so the expected number of any digit is 4. A bid of 8 is high. However, the bidding history shows Player 4 bidding 5 5s, Player 1 jumping significantly to 7 5s, and Player 2 raising to 8 5s. This strong sequence suggests a high likelihood that those players collectively hold many 5s, making a challenge risky, especially since I hold zero 5s (meaning the other 32 digits must contain all eight 5s). I need to make a higher bid. Options are 8 6s or higher, or 9 of any digit. My hand (32073184) contains two 3s, and only one or zero of digits 6, 7, 8, 9. Bidding 8 6s/7s/8s/9s isn't well supported. Increasing the quantity to 9 seems necessary. Bidding 9 3s is the most supported bid based on my hand (two 3s). This also builds on my previous bid of 5 3s in the prior round.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 3s. I have one 3 in my hand, and with 40 total digits remaining, it's unlikely there are 9 3s across all players. Challenging this bid is reasonable as the probability of the actual count meeting or exceeding 9 is low.

Player 4 Reasoning: Since the current bid is None, I can start with a reasonable bid. My hand contains a 5, and bidding 3 5s is a moderate quantity that leverages the digit I hold. This is higher than the minimum required and sets a plausible baseline for the round.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:5 - openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. My hand contains zero 5s. With 4 players and 32 total digits, the average expected count for any digit is 3.2. Since I have zero 5s, the other 3 players must collectively hold at least three 5s for the bid to be true. There are 24 digits among the other 3 players. The expected number of 5s among these 24 digits is 2.4. A bid of 3 is above this expectation. Based on a random distribution model, the probability of having 3 or more 5s in 24 digits is approximately 43%. This means the probability of having less than 3 (0, 1, or 2) is approximately 57%. Challenging the bid of 3 5s has a favorable probability of winning (around 57%) given my hand. This is a good opportunity to leverage my specific information and potentially eliminate an opponent.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains a 5, and I have one instance of it. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable starting point, as there's a possibility the other two players collectively hold two more 5s. This bid is higher than 'None' and leverages a digit present in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: Player 4 bid 3 5s. I have two 5s in my hand. Since there are 24 digits remaining across 3 players, it's reasonable to assume there are at least 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s is a safe move, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 1. I have the hand 84860315, which contains one 6. Given that there are 24 total digits remaining and 3 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. The bid of 4 6s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. My hand contains two 5s and one 6. If I bid 5 5s, I would be increasing the quantity, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have one 5 in my hand, but with 24 total digits across three players, it's possible the actual count of 5s is less than 5. Challenging this bid could expose the inaccuracy, especially since previous challenges have succeeded when bids exceeded actual counts. For example, Player 4 previously challenged a 9 3s bid and won when the actual count was 5. This suggests that high bids are often overestimated. Challenging here is a strategic move to eliminate the bidder if the count is indeed low.
