Player 1 Reasoning: I hold four 0s in my hand, so bidding 4 0s is guaranteed by my own cards. This safely raises the bid to a level others will have to significantly challenge to overtake, leveraging my strong zero count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. Given that there are 48 digits remaining, and considering that 4 0s is a plausible bid, it would be risky to challenge. However, I can safely bid 5 0s, increasing the quantity while keeping the same digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 2's bid of 5 0s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (59547296), I don't have any 0s. This means there would need to be at least 5 zeros among the other 5 players' 40 digits. While this is certainly possible (about 1/3 of the remaining digits would need to be 0s), it's not unreasonable. Since I don't have strong evidence to challenge, I should make a higher bid. I could bid 6 0s, but that's risky without any 0s in my hand. Instead, I'll bid 5 1s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit. This is safer since I have a 1 in my hand, contributing to my own bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have two 1s in my hand (75097145). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have two 1s, the total count of 1s across all players must be at least 2 (mine) plus whatever the other 5 players have. It's reasonable to assume other players might have 1s, so bidding 6 1s is a possibility. However, increasing the digit is also an option. I can bid 5 2s or higher. Given that I don't have any 2s, I should be cautious. I will increase the digit to 2s, as it's a relatively safe move, making the new bid 5 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. Bidding higher than 5 2s is necessary. I have two 8s, so bidding 6 8s is a plausible option, increasing the quantity significantly. I could also bid 5 3s, but 6 8s feels safer given my hand and the previous bids. It's unlikely multiple players have a large number of 2s, but I don't want to challenge immediately without more information.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have four 0s in my hand, so there are guaranteed at least two 0s in total. The current bid of 1 0s is too low, so raising to 2 0s is safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. I also have two 4s and one 2. Since I can't be sure of the other players' digits, bidding 3 0s is a safe and reasonable increase. Challenging seems risky because I have one 0 in my hand, and it's possible that other players have 0s as well.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have the hand 59547296, which contains no 0s. The current bid is 3 0s made by Player 2. There are 5 active players with 8 digits each, for a total of 40 digits in play. Since I have no 0s in my hand, that means there are at most 32 digits among the other players that could be 0s. The current bid of 3 0s is quite low compared to the maximum possible, so it's very likely to be true. In the previous round, players were comfortable bidding up to 5 for various digits, so 3 is relatively conservative. I should make a higher bid. I have one 9 in my hand, so I could bid 3 9s (same quantity, higher digit). Alternatively, I could bid 4 with a digit I have multiple of, like 4 5s since I have one 5. Given the conservative bidding so far, I'll go with 3 9s to increase the digit but keep the same quantity.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand is 75097145, which contains one 9. So, I have at least one 9. The total count of 9s across all players must be at least 1 (from my hand) plus potentially others. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll consider the probability and the current bid. Bidding 4 9s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. However, I should also consider that there are 40 digits in total and the distribution is unknown. Given that 9 is a relatively high digit and my hand has one, I will increase the quantity to make a new bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. My hand is 75097145. I count 2 fives and 1 seven. A reasonable starting bid could be based on the digits I see. Since there's no previous bid, I can start with a low quantity. I see 2 fives, and assuming the other players might have a few, bidding on 5s seems reasonable. I'll bid 5 5s as it's a moderate start.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 5s in my hand. With only 24 unknown digits left and each digit equally likely, the expected number of 5s is about 2.4 and the chance of there being at least 5 is under 10%. This bid is very unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have four 0s in my hand, guaranteeing at least four 0s across the 24 digits. Bidding 4 0s is safe—it pressures opponents while ensuring I win any challenge on this bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is '4 0s'. I have two 2s in my hand, which is a relatively rare digit given the bidding history. Since the highest bid so far was '6 8s', and we know there are only 24 digits remaining, it's possible that higher quantities of lower digits exist. Bidding '5 2s' increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid, and it's a reasonable risk based on my hand and the game history.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (59547296), I have one 2. Player 2 has bid 5 2s, meaning they believe there are at least 5 twos among all players. With only 24 total digits remaining (8 per player), and knowing I have only one 2, this means Player 1 and Player 2 would need to have at least 4 more 2s between them. While possible, I need to decide if I should challenge or make a higher bid. I have one 5, one 7, and one 9 in my hand, which could support a higher bid. Since I'm not confident enough to challenge, I'll make a higher bid. I'll bid 5 5s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value, which is a valid higher bid than 5 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand. For there to be at least five 5s among all 24 digits, the other 16 digits would need to contain all five, which is extremely unlikely (≈1.7% chance). This bid is probably a bluff, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I hold four 0s. With eight unknown digits, the chance the opponent has 0 or 1 zero (and would challenge) is about 81%, and in those cases the bid of 5 zeros is true (4+opponent ≥1). If they have ≥2 zeros (~18%), they’ll raise to 6 zeros and I’ll challenge and win, since they only raise when it’s guaranteed. Overall I win ~81% of the time by leading with 5 zeros.
