Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I see three 0s in my own eight digits. With 48 digits in play, the average count for any digit is about 5. Having three myself makes it very likely (roughly 78% probability) that there are at least three more 0s among the other 40 unseen digits. This is a safe yet respectable opening bid that is unlikely to be challenged immediately while leaving room for future raises.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 12831015. I have one 0, three 1s, one 2, one 3, one 5, and one 8. The current bid is 6 0s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. A bid of 6 0s means Player 0 believes there are at least six 0s in total.  With my hand having only one 0, this seems like a high bid, but not impossible.  However, I have three 1s in my hand.  A bid of 7 1s is a higher quantity than the current bid and seems plausible given my hand and the number of players. Bidding 7 1s is a safe increase based on my strong holding of 1s.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s made by Player 1. I have one 1 in my hand. Given that there are 6 active players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 48 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. I should consider the likelihood of there being at least 7 1s in total. Since I only have one 1, and assuming the other players might have a few 1s as well, bidding slightly higher seems reasonable. I will bid 8 2s, increasing the quantity and choosing a digit that I have in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 2s made by Player 2. I have one 2 in my hand, so I can't make a higher bid with the same digit. However, I can increase the digit to 3, which is the next highest digit I have in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 3s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8. A bid of 8 is significantly above average. More importantly, I hold zero 3s in my hand. This means the other 5 players must collectively hold 8 or more 3s among their 40 digits. The probability of this occurring is low (estimated around 4-5%). Challenging this bid has a high probability of success (~95-96%). Bidding higher, even on digits I have multiples of (like 6s or 9s), would require bidding 8 of a digit, which has a lower probability of being true if challenged (~20.6% for 8 6s or 8 9s given my hand). Challenging the current unlikely bid is the optimal strategy.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round. My hand is 71459696. I have two 9s and two 6s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. Bidding 4 9s is a standard opening bid, representing the average expected count and aligning with my hand strength.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s by Player 4. My hand contains 0 9s, so I cannot contribute to this digit. The total digits remaining are 40, and with 5 players, the maximum possible 9s would be 40, but realistically, the count is likely close to the average of 4 (40/10 digits). Challenging the bid of 4 9s is risky if the count is exactly 4, but given that I have none and the bid is at the expected average, it's plausible the count is lower. Bidding higher (e.g., 5 9s) would force others to challenge, but I have no 9s to back it. Challenging is the more aggressive play here.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make a conservative yet plausible bid based on my hand. I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s is reasonable. This accounts for my two 8s and assumes at least one other player has an 8. Starting with a slightly higher digit increases the likelihood of the bid holding, as higher digits are less common and harder to verify immediately.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:2 - o3-2025-04-16) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold three 0s (0,0,0) out of my eight digits. The current bid is 3 8s. Challenging that bid is risky: with 24 unseen digits, the expected number of 8s is about 2.4, so reaching 3 total 8s is quite plausible. Instead, I will raise the bid. By moving to 4 0s I increase the quantity, satisfying the ‘higher’ rule, and choose a digit I already have in abundance. Only one additional 0 is needed among the 24 unknown digits, which has roughly a 90% chance of occurring. This makes 4 0s a solid, defendable bid that puts pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 1s and one 0, one 2, one 3, one 5, and one 8. The current bid is 4 0s.  With 4 players and 32 total digits, the average count for any digit is 3.2.  Bidding 4 0s is slightly above average but not unreasonable. I have one 0.  I have two 1s. Bidding 4 1s is a valid bid and is equal in quantity to the current bid but on a higher digit. This is a plausible bid given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s made by Player 1. I have one 1 in my hand. Given that there are 3 other active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total number of 1s could be higher but also could be lower. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should consider the likelihood of the current bid being true. With 32 total digits remaining and 4 players, if we assume an even distribution, 8 1s would be the maximum possible. However, it's unlikely that all players have 1s. I will make a bid that is strictly higher than 4 1s. I have a 7 in my hand, and bidding on a digit I have seems reasonable. Bidding 5 7s seems too high given I only have one 7, so I will bid 5 2s as there are 2s available and it meets the criteria of being higher than 4 1s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 5 2s. Bidding 5 6s is a valid higher bid by increasing the digit. Since I have two 6s, it's plausible there are at least five 6s in total across all hands. This avoids challenging a bid that may be close to the actual count while maintaining pressure on opponents.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:2 - o3-2025-04-16) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: There are 32 total digits and I hold none of the claimed digit (6). That leaves 24 unknown digits. With a 10% chance for any given digit to be a 6, the expected number of 6s in those 24 digits is only 2.4. The probability that there are at least five 6s among those 24 digits is roughly 10%. For Player 5 to feel safe with a bid of 5 6s they would usually need to hold 3-4 sixes themselves, but the chance of any 8-digit hand containing 3 or more sixes is below 4%. Overall, the bid looks highly overstated, so challenging gives me about a 90% chance to succeed, which is far better than making a speculative higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my own hand. With 16 unknown digits between the other two players, the chance that at least one more 0 is present is above 80%, so a bid of 4 0s is very likely to be correct if it is challenged immediately. It is also a modest opening bid that doesn’t give away too much information while forcing the others to raise or switch digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 12831015. I have three 1s, one 2, one 8, one 3, one 0, and one 5. The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. With 24 total digits among 3 players, the average count for any digit is 2.4. A bid of 4 0s is slightly above average, but not excessively so. Given I have three 1s, bidding 5 1s seems like a reasonable increase from the current bid of 4 0s, as it increases both the quantity and the digit, and is supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s made by Player 1. I have one 1 in my hand. Given that there are only 24 total digits remaining and 3 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. I should assess if bidding higher is reasonable or if challenging is more strategic. Since I have one 1, and assuming the other players might have a few 1s as well, bidding 6 1s seems risky but possible. However, I can also consider bidding a different digit. I have two 3s, and bidding on 3s could be a safer option. Bidding 7 0s or another digit seems more conservative but I need to ensure it's higher than 5 1s. Bidding 6 2s seems reasonable as it's higher than 5 1s and I have a 2 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I can see exactly two 2s in my hand. To satisfy Player 2’s bid of 6 2s, at least four more 2s would have to be hidden in the 16 digits held by Players 1 and 2. With each digit having only a 10% chance of being a 2, the expected number of additional 2s is about 1.6 and the probability of there being four or more is under 10%. Even if Player 2 is unusually lucky and holds three 2s, the bid still succeeds less than half the time. The odds are firmly in my favour to challenge rather than make an even riskier higher bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I already have three 0s in my own hand, so a bid of 3 0s is guaranteed to be correct no matter what Player 1 holds. Because 3 is above the expected number of zeros in 16 random digits, the bid looks somewhat ambitious and may tempt Player 1 to challenge, which would immediately give me the win. Even if they don’t challenge, the bid is still low enough that I have room to react to any raise they make.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have two 1s, two 0s, one 2, one 3, one 8, and one 5 in my hand. With 16 total digits, the expected count of any digit is around 1.6.  Player 0's bid of 3 0s is slightly higher than expected, but not unreasonable, especially if they have multiple 0s. I have two 1s in my hand. Bidding 4 1s is a reasonable increase on the previous bid and is supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 1s in my hand. For Player 1’s bid of 4 1s to be correct, all four (or more) 1s would have to come from their eight unknown digits. Randomly, the chance of an 8-digit hand containing four or more 1s is about 0.5 %. Even if Player 1 is inclined to over-bid only when they hold three 1s, they would still need at least one 1 in my hand—which I know is impossible. Because the likelihood that there are ≥4 total 1s is extremely small, challenging is far safer than trying to out-bid.
