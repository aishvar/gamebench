Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s, which is relatively low. I have no 0s in my hand, but with 5 other players, it's possible there are at least 2 0s in total. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Since the bid is low and challenging might be risky, I'll make a conservative higher bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 2 1s and I have one 1 in my hand (79513462), increasing the quantity to 3 while keeping the same digit seems like a reasonable move. This bid is strictly higher than the current bid, as required by the game rules. Since I do have a 1, it's possible that other players might also have 1s, making this bid potentially valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I only have one 1, so challenging 3 1s is risky—the expected number of 1s among the other 40 cards is around 4. Instead, I can make the minimal legal raise to 3 2s. I hold two 2s, and it’s very likely there’s at least one more among the other 40 cards, making this a safe bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have the hand 77963111, which contains one 1 and no 2s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 2s, I think 3 2s might be a bit high, but I also don't have information about others' hands. I will increase the digit to make a new bid. Bidding 3 3s is a reasonable next step as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 08987372, which contains two 3s, one 0, one 2, one 7, two 8s, and one 9. The current bid is 3 3s by Player 4. Since I have two 3s myself, it’s plausible that there is at least one more 3 among the other players’ hands, making the bid of 3 3s reasonable. Challenging now might be risky as the bid could easily be met. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. I could bid 3 4s to increase the digit, but I have no 4s, so I’m not confident about that. Alternatively, I have two 8s, which is a strong count for a single digit in my hand. Bidding 4 8s increases the quantity and jumps to a higher digit, which feels like a safer and more strategic move given my hand strength in 8s. The total digits are 48, so 4 8s is only about 8.3% of the total, which isn’t too unlikely even if others don’t have many 8s. I’ll go with that.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. To bid, I need to increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 5 of any digit seems risky. However, bidding 4 9s is a safe option as it only increases the digit and is a valid bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. With 5 other players, it's possible there are at least 3 more 9s to meet the bid. However, bidding higher would require either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, I can only increase the quantity. Bidding 5 9s seems risky as it's unlikely there are that many 9s across all hands. Therefore, I should challenge the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '1 0s' and my hand of 79513462, which contains no 0s but has a variety of other digits, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have two 6s and considering the distribution of digits might favor lower to middle digits due to the nature of the game and the bids made so far, bidding on a digit I have in abundance seems like a good strategy. However, I must ensure my bid is reasonable and not too aggressive, given the total digits remaining and the fact that I don't have a clear picture of other players' hands. Bidding on a higher digit than 0, considering I don't have any 0s, seems like the safest approach. Given that I have two 6s and the game has just started with a low bid, I can consider bidding on 6s, but I should also consider the possibility of bidding on a lower digit if I think it's more likely to be abundant across all hands.

Player 3 Reasoning: I hold two 8s in my hand, so bidding 2 8s is a valid raise over 2 6s and is guaranteed to hold since I already have the required cards. Challenging 2 6s is unwise given the expected count of 6s in the remaining 32 cards.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. Given that there are 40 digits in total and 32 of them are not mine, it's possible that there are at least 2 8s. However, I can see that my hand contains several other digits. I can bid higher than 2 8s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 7 and a 9, and there are other players, bidding 3 7s seems like a reasonable increase in quantity and a valid bid because 7 is less than 8 but I can compensate with a higher quantity.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 08987372, which contains two 7s and two 8s. The current bid is 3 7s by Player 4. Since I have two 7s myself, it's possible that there is at least one more 7 among the other 32 digits across the remaining players, making the bid of 3 7s plausible. However, I need to make a higher bid. I can bid 3 8s, as it is a higher digit with the same quantity, and I have two 8s in my hand, which supports the possibility of at least one more 8 existing among the other players. Bidding 3 8s feels safer than increasing the quantity to 4 or more, given I don't have strong evidence for a higher count of any digit. I will avoid challenging since the current bid of 3 7s seems reasonable with my contribution of two 7s.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand. I could bid 3 9s or 4 of any digit. I have two 0s and two 9s. Given the game history, bidding 4 0s seems slightly less risky than 4 9s, as Player 0 opened with a bid of 2 0s this round, suggesting they might not have many, and I have two already. However, I will bid 4 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 0s and my hand of 79513462, I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Since my hand contains no 0s, I have limited information about the likelihood of the current bid being true. However, considering the total number of digits remaining is 40 and there are 5 players, the maximum number of any single digit is capped. Given that I have a 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and another digit in my hand, and looking at the bidding history where players have bid on various digits, it seems plausible that the number of 0s could be less than 4, especially since no one has bid on 0s until now except for the initial 1 0s and the current 4 0s. The fact that Player 0 made a relatively safe initial bid of 1 0s and then jumped to 4 0s after seeing other players' bids might indicate an attempt to bluff or take advantage of the situation. Considering these factors, challenging the current bid seems like a reasonable strategy, especially since I don't have enough information to make a significantly higher bid with confidence.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have the hand 77963111, which contains one 2. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I see multiple digits in my hand, I can make an educated guess. I have a total of 3 '1's and '7's, which are higher than 2. I can bid 2 7s, increasing the digit. Alternatively, I can bid 3 1s, increasing the quantity. Given that I have one 2 and there are 3 other players, it's plausible that the total count of 1s is at least 3. Thus, bidding 3 1s seems reasonable.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s made by Player 4. In my hand, I have one 1 (from 08987372), so I know at least one 1 exists. With 32 total digits across 4 players, it's plausible that there could be 3 or more 1s in total, as each player has 8 digits. However, I also notice that I have three 8s in my hand, which is a strong count for a single digit. Bidding higher on 8s seems like a safer move given my hand strength. I will bid 4 8s, increasing both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 3 1s. This bid reflects confidence in my hand while still being within a reasonable range, considering the total digits.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. The total number of digits is 32. Bidding higher than 4 8s without any information is risky. I could bid 5 0s, but that seems unlikely. I will challenge the current bid of 4 8s, as it is possible there are fewer than 4 eights in total.

With 24 total digits across three players, a bid of 3 8s seems plausible as it accounts for at least one more 8 in the other players' hands, which is likely.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 3. I have the hand 77963111, which contains one 8. Given that there are 24 total digits and I have 8 of them, there are 16 digits remaining with the other two players. The total count of 8s across all players must be at least 1 (from my hand) plus some from the other two players. It's plausible that the total count of 8s is 4 or more, considering the bid history and the fact that Player 5 previously bid 3 8s. However, to make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand doesn't have a high number of 8s, I'll consider increasing the digit. Bidding 4 9s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases the digit, making it harder for others to have a high count unless they have multiple 9s. I'll analyze the likelihood based on the game history and my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 08987372, which contains two 8s and one 9. The current bid is 4 9s by Player 4. Since there are 24 total digits across three players, it's possible but not highly likely that there are 4 or more 9s in total, given I only have one. However, challenging carries a risk of elimination if I'm wrong. Bidding higher, I could go to 5 0s or higher, but with no 0s in my hand, I'm not confident in pushing the bid further on a digit I lack. Given the bid history, Player 4 might be bluffing on 9s since the previous bids focused on 8s. I’ll take the risk and challenge, as 4 9s feels like a stretch with only one in my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 08987372, which gives me two 8s, two 7s, and one each of 0, 9, 3, and 2. With only 16 total digits in play across two players, I should make a conservative bid to start. Bidding on my strongest digit, which is 8, seems reasonable. A bid of 3 8s is plausible since I have two myself, and it's possible the other player has at least one. This keeps the bid low enough to avoid an immediate challenge while still putting pressure on the opponent.
