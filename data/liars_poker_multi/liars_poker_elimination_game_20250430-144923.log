Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the bidding and there are no previous bids to consider, I should make a bid that is reasonable and based on my hand. I have the digits 1, 4, 6, 0, 2, 1, 3, and 9. Since I have two 1s, bidding on 1s seems like a good starting point. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 players, it's possible that there could be at least 3 of any given digit across all hands. Therefore, bidding 3 1s seems like a cautious yet plausible starting bid, taking into account the information from my hand and the total possible distribution of digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s made by Player 0. I have two 1s in my hand. Given that there are 6 players and each player has 8 digits, there are a total of 48 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. Since I have two 1s and there could be more 1s in other players' hands, bidding 4 1s seems reasonable and increases the quantity. However, I should also consider the possibility of bidding a higher digit if I have a strong presence of that digit in my hand. I have one 9, but it's unlikely that 9s are as common as 1s. Therefore, increasing the quantity of 1s seems like a safe bet.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand. The current bid is 4 1s. Bidding 4 3s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Given my three 3s and five other players, it's likely there's at least one more 3 in total, making this bid plausible.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits. The expected average count for any digit is 4.8. A bid of 4 3s is plausible and challenging it seems premature. My hand is 42125512. I have zero 3s, which slightly lowers the probability of the current bid being true, but not enough to warrant a challenge at this low level. I need to make a higher bid. Options include increasing the quantity (to 5) or keeping the quantity (4) and increasing the digit (4s, 5s, etc.). My hand contains three 2s, which is my strongest digit. Bidding 5 2s is a valid higher bid (increasing quantity from 4 to 5). Given I hold three 2s, it's statistically likely that there are at least two more 2s among the remaining 40 digits held by other players (expected number of 2s among others is 40/10 = 4). Therefore, bidding 5 2s is a strong move based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have one '5' in my hand and multiple 5s and 6s overall, but no '2's. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 5 and increase the digit. Bidding 5 3s is invalid because 3 < 5 in quantity is not higher, but 5 3s is same quantity and higher digit than 5 2s, so it's valid. However, 5 3s is lower digit than 5 2s in digit? No, 3 > 2, so it's valid. But the previous bid was 5 2s, so bidding 5 3s is a valid higher bid. I have no 3s in my hand, but 5 3s is a reasonable incremental bid. Alternatively, I can bid 6 0s to increase quantity significantly, but 6 0s might be risky without any zeros in my hand. I have two 6s, so bidding 5 6s is valid and likely safer. 5 6s is same quantity but digit 6 > 2, so it's higher. I have two 6s, so bidding 5 6s is reasonable. I will bid 5 6s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have only one 6 in my hand, so claiming 6 6s is impossible. The highest I could plausibly claim is 5 6s, but since that bid has already been made, I need to bid higher. The next logical step is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, i.e., 5 7s, which is a higher bid than 5 6s. I have no 7s, but the total number of 7s across all hands could be higher than 5, so it's a reasonable bid. Alternatively, I could challenge if I believe the previous bid is unlikely, but given my hand, raising the digit seems the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 7s and my hand 14602139, I notice I have no 7s. Considering the total possible count of any digit is 48 and the current bid is already at 5, increasing the quantity further might be risky. However, since the digit 7 is already at its highest possible bid without exceeding the total count of digits (48), and I have no 7s in my hand, I should consider challenging this bid. The bid of 5 7s seems plausible but challenging it could be beneficial if the actual count is lower than 5, given that I have no contribution to this digit.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current round has no bids yet, so I can start by making a safe bid that is unlikely to be challenged immediately. My hand contains 6, 2, 7, 1, 7, 0, 0, which includes two 7s. Bidding 2 7s is safe as I know I have at least two 7s, and it sets a modest starting point. Since no previous bid exists, I can bid 2 7s to initiate the bidding.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s made by Player 5. I have 2 sevens in my hand (7 appears twice). To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand only contains 2 sevens, I can try to increase the digit. Bidding 2 8s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit than 7, and I'm not overestimating the total count since I don't have any 8s but I'm just making a slightly higher bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. My hand contains three 3s, which allows me to confidently bid 3 3s (higher quantity). This is a safer move than challenging, as I can guarantee at least three 3s exist (my own), and it raises the stakes without relying on uncertain assumptions about others' digits.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. On average, there should be 4 of each digit. The bid of 3 3s is below the average and therefore likely true, making a challenge risky. My hand is 42125512. I have three 2s, which is a strong count for a single digit. Bidding 4 2s is a valid higher bid (increasing quantity). Given I hold three 2s, needing only one more 2 among the remaining 32 digits held by other players makes this a statistically sound and safe bid based on my hand.

I have two 6s and one 5 and one 7 in my hand, so bidding 4 5s is a reasonable next step. It is a higher digit than 2 and matches the quantity, and I have some confidence in the presence of 5s given my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have the digits 6, 2, 7, 1, 7, 7, 0, 0 in my hand, which includes three 7s and no 5s. To beat the current bid, I can either increase the quantity or increase the digit. Since I have no 5s, I cannot bid more 5s. The next higher quantity with the same digit (5) is 5 5s, but I have zero 5s, so that's impossible. Increasing the digit to 6 with the same quantity (4) would be a valid bid: '4 6s'. I have at least one 6, so this bid is plausible. Alternatively, challenging might be risky given the current bid and my hand. Given the hand and the need to make a valid bid, bidding 4 6s seems like the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. The expected number of any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. A bid of 6 is significantly above the average. My hand (42125512) contains zero 6s. This means for the bid to be true, the remaining 32 digits held by the other 4 players must contain at least six 6s. The expected number of 6s in those 32 digits is 3.2. While the bidding escalated quickly on 6s (Player 5: 4 6s, Player 1: 5 6s, Player 2: 6 6s), suggesting potential strength, the statistical probability of having 6 or more 6s out of 40 is relatively low (around 21.5%), and even lower given I hold none. Making a higher bid, like 7 2s (based on my three 2s) or 6 7s, feels risky or like a blind bluff. Challenging seems the most prudent move based on the probabilities and my lack of the bid digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: It's my turn to start the bidding for this round. I have three 2s, two 1s, and two 5s in my hand of 8 digits (42125512). With 32 total digits among 4 players, the expected average count for any digit is 3.2. Having three 2s is slightly above average. Bidding based on my strongest digit is a good starting strategy. A bid of '3 2s' would be extremely safe as I hold all three. A bid of '4 2s' is also quite plausible, requiring only one more 2 among the other 24 digits held by the other 3 players. Given I bid 2s in the previous rounds (5 2s and 4 2s), bidding '4 2s' again reinforces this and is statistically reasonable.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. My hand contains the digits 6, 2, 7, 1, 7, 7, 0, 0. Counting the 5s in my hand, I have none. Given there are only 32 total digits, the likelihood of there being 4 or more 5s overall is low, especially since previous bids have not indicated many 5s. Bidding higher on 5s (like 4 6s) is risky because I have no 6s either. Challenging the current bid of 4 5s seems prudent since it's unlikely that all four 5s are present, considering my hand and the previous bids. Therefore, I will challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s by Player 4. I have two 5s in my hand (42125512). For the bid to be true, Player 4 must have at least two 5s (4 total - 2 I have = 2). This is plausible, making a challenge risky. My hand contains three 2s. My previous bid was 3 2s, which Player 4 did not challenge, instead bidding 4 5s. Bidding 5 2s is a strong move based on my hand. It requires Player 4 to have at least two 2s (5 total - 3 I have = 2). This is also plausible, and Player 4's previous non-challenge of 3 2s might suggest they hold some 2s. Bidding 5 2s leverages my known strength and puts the pressure back on Player 4, forcing them to either challenge a bid backed by my three 2s or make a higher bid (like 5 3s or more).

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have one '2' in my hand and three '5's. Since the bid is already at quantity 5 for digit 2, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. The next higher bid could be 5 3s or 6 of any digit. I don't have many 3s, but I have three 5s, so bidding 5 3s might be risky. The safest is to increase the quantity to 6 2s or 6 5s. Given that I have only one '2', 6 2s seems unlikely. I have three '5's, but the bid must be higher than 5 2s and 5 3s is higher in digit but same quantity, so 5 3s is a valid higher bid. I'll bid 5 3s as it is a safer increment and my hand supports some 3s presence.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s, made by Player 4. I have 8 digits, and Player 4 has 8 digits, for a total of 16. My hand (42125512) contains zero 3s. For the bid of 5 3s to be correct, Player 4 must possess at least five 3s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of one player having 5 or more of a specific digit out of 8 is very low (5/8 = 62.5% of their hand). The expected number of 3s across all 16 digits is 1.6. A bid of 5 is significantly higher than the expected value, especially when I hold none of the bid digit. Making a higher bid, such as 5 4s (I have one 4), 5 5s (I have two 5s), or 6 2s (I have three 2s), would require Player 4 to have a large number of those digits (4, 3, or 3 respectively), which is also uncertain and potentially risky if challenged. Given the high improbability of Player 4 holding five or more 3s, challenging the current bid is the most strategically sound action.
