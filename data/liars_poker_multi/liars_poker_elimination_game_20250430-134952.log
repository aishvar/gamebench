Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no previous bid has been made, I can start by bidding based on my hand. I have the digits 5, 3, 8, 7, 1, 6, 2, 0. Counting each digit: 0 (1), 1 (1), 2 (1), 3 (1), 5 (1), 6 (1), 7 (1), 8 (1). To be safe, I can bid 1 of the digit I hold, such as 1 8s, which is a conservative opening bid. Alternatively, I could choose a higher bid to be more aggressive, but starting with 1 8s is reasonable given my hand and the total of 48 digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 8s. The current bid is 1 8s, so increasing the quantity to 2 8s is a valid and logical next bid. This leverages my own cards while adhering to the rules of strictly higher bids.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, making it unlikely that there are many 8s among all players. However, the current bid is only 2 8s out of 48 digits, which is a very conservative bid. Statistically, even if I have none, it's likely that at least two 8s exist among the remaining 40 digits. Challenging at this low quantity is risky. Therefore, I will make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit to 9, keeping the quantity at 2.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (94564044), meaning only one more 9 is needed across the other 40 digits for the bid to be true. The expected number of 9s is 4.8 (48 total digits / 10 possible digits), so 2 9s is extremely likely to be true. Challenging is not a good option. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains three 4s. Bidding based on my strongest digit is a good strategy. A bid of '3 4s' is higher than '2 9s' and is certainly true based on my hand alone. A bid of '4 4s' is also higher and very likely true, as it only requires one additional 4 among the other 40 digits (where the expected number is roughly 4). Bidding '4 4s' is a stronger, yet still safe, bid based on my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s made by Player 3. I have the hand 99069381, which contains two 4s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand only contains two 4s, bidding a higher digit seems more feasible. I can see that the current highest bid digit is 9, so bidding a 9 would be a good strategy. However, I should also consider the likelihood of the current bid being true and my own hand strength.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have two 4s in my hand (99069381). To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 4s, bidding 5 4s seems reasonable. However, I should also consider if there's a possibility of having a higher digit in my hand that could make the bid more likely to be valid. My hand contains an 8 and a 9, which are higher digits. But given that I only have one of these higher digits, increasing the quantity seems more feasible with the information I have.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 4 and one 5 in my hand. The current bid of 5 4s requires at least five 4s across all 48 digits. Given the expected average of ~4.8 for any digit and my knowledge of only one 4, this bid is slightly above average but plausible. Instead of challenging, I choose to bid 5 5s (same quantity, higher digit). This leverages my own 5 and shifts focus to a digit with similar statistical likelihood, avoiding direct confrontation on the marginal 4s bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I know I have only one 5 in my hand, so the total number of 5s across all hands cannot possibly reach 5. Challenging now would be a safe move, as the bid seems highly unlikely to be truthful given my knowledge. Bidding higher would be risky since I don't have enough 5s to justify a higher bid, and raising the digit wouldn't help because the total count of 5s cannot reach 5. Therefore, I should challenge the current bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The previous round ended with a challenge and no current bid, so I can start the new round with a bid. My hand contains the digits 5, 3, 8, 7, 1, 6, 2, 0. I have one 8 and one 5, which are the most common digits in my hand. Since the total digits remaining are 40, I can safely bid 1 8s or 1 5s, but to be more conservative and strategic, I will bid 2 8s, assuming I might have at least two in total, considering the previous bids and my hand. This is a safe opening bid that is higher than no previous bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 42220531, which contains two 2s, two 0s, one 5, one 3, one 1, and one 4. The current bid is 3 1s. I have only one 1 in my hand, and with 5 players each holding 8 digits, there are 40 digits total. Statistically, each digit should appear about 4 times, so 3 1s is plausible. However, since I must raise the bid, I will consider digits I have multiple of. I have two 2s and two 0s, so bidding 3 2s is a safe increase (same quantity, higher digit).

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have zero 2s in my hand (94564044). While I don't have any 2s, a total quantity of 3 across 40 digits is statistically quite likely (average is 4). Challenging seems risky. My strongest digit is 4, as I hold four 4s. The current bid is 3 2s. I can make a significantly higher bid based on my hand. Bidding 4 4s is guaranteed true based on my hand alone, but doesn't put much pressure. Bidding 5 4s leverages my strong hand (four 4s) and only requires one additional 4 among the remaining 32 digits held by other players. Given the statistical average (40/10 = 4), finding at least one more 4 is highly probable. This is a strong bid based on my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is '5 4s' made by Player 3. I have the hand '99069381', which contains one 4. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total number of digits is 40. The bid of '5 4s' seems high but possible. However, I must consider if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is more strategic. Since my hand only contains one 4, and I need to make a bid higher than '5 4s', I can either increase the quantity or the digit. A reasonable approach would be to bid on a digit that I have multiple instances of or a higher digit if I have it. I have two 9s, which could be a good option.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s made by Player 3. I have the digits 9, 9, 0, 6, 9, 3, 8, 1 in my hand. I see that there are 40 total digits remaining across 5 players. This means the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Given that my hand contains two 9s and no 4s, I should consider bidding on a digit that is likely to have a high count or challenging the current bid. Since 5 4s seems plausible but not extremely high, I should evaluate if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more strategic. My hand has two 9s, so bidding on 9s could be a good strategy. I can bid higher than 5 4s by increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 6 9s seems aggressive but possible given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s, and I need to make a higher bid. I have one 9 in my hand, so I can't bid 7 9s as I only have one. The next higher quantity would be 6 9s, but that's not higher than 6. The only way to beat 6 9s is to increase the digit. I have a 5, 8, 7, 1, 6, 2, 0, and 3. I can bid 6 9s, but that's not strictly higher. The next possible bid is 7 0s, or 6 10s, but 10 is invalid digit. Alternatively, I can challenge if I think the total count of 9s is less than 6, which is likely given my hand and previous bids. Since I only have one 9, it's unlikely that there are 6 or more 9s across all hands. Challenging seems the best move to attempt to eliminate the previous bidder.

Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet in this round, I can start by bidding a low but safe amount to gather information and avoid challenging prematurely. My hand contains the digits 5, 3, 8, 7, 1, 6, 2, 0, with one '8' and one '5'. Given the total of 32 digits, a bid of '1 8s' is reasonable as it matches my own '8', and I can confidently support that bid. Bidding higher than that without evidence would be risky, so starting with '1 8s' seems prudent.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, which is plausible since there are 32 digits in play and I only have one. It's early in the round, so challenging now is risky. To increase the bid, I can either bid 2 9s (same quantity, higher digit) or 3 0s (higher quantity). I have two 2s in my hand, so bidding 2 9s is safer, but bidding 3 2s leverages my own hand strength. However, since 2 9s is the minimal valid raise and keeps the pressure low, I'll bid that.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (94564044). With 32 total digits across 4 players, the expected number of 9s is 3.2 (32/10). Since I have one, needing only one more 9 among the remaining 24 digits held by other players makes the bid of 2 9s highly likely to be true. Challenging is therefore risky and statistically unfavorable. I should make a higher bid. My hand is very strong in 4s, as I hold four of them (94564044). Bidding on 4s is my best strategy. A bid of 3 4s or 4 4s would be extremely safe since I hold four 4s myself. A bid of 5 4s requires only one additional 4 among the other 24 digits. The expected number of 4s among the other 24 digits is 2.4 (24/10). Therefore, a total of 5 4s is statistically quite likely (my 4 + expected 2.4 = 6.4). Bidding 5 4s is a strong move that leverages my hand's strength and significantly increases the bid from 2 9s.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s, and I have the digits 5, 3, 8, 7, 1, 6, 2, 0 in my hand. Counting the 4s in my hand, I see zero. Given that the total digits remaining are 32, and previous bids include 2 8s and 2 9s, the total count of 4s across all hands is likely not reaching 5. Challenging the current bid seems prudent as it's unlikely the total number of 4s is at least 5. Alternatively, I could bid higher, but since I have no 4s, increasing the bid on 4s is risky. Bidding on a higher digit (like 5 5s or more) would be less safe, so the best move is to challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I am Player 3 and the first bidder in this round with 3 players and 24 total digits. My hand is 94564044, containing four 4s, one 0, one 5, one 6, and one 9. The expected average count for any digit is 2.4 (24 digits / 10 possibilities). My four 4s represent a significant concentration. Statistically, the other 16 digits held by Player 1 and Player 2 should contain about 1.6 more 4s (16 * 0.1). This suggests a total of around 5.6 fours (4 + 1.6). In the previous round, my bid of '5 4s' was challenged by Player 0, and the actual count was 5, resulting in my win. Given my strong hand in 4s and the recent successful outcome of the '5 4s' bid, repeating this bid is a strong opening move.

Player 3 Reasoning: I am Player 3, and it's my turn to start the bidding in this 1v1 round against Player 2. There are 16 total digits (8 for me, 8 for Player 2). My hand is 94564044, which contains four 4s, one 0, one 5, one 6, and one 9. Having four 4s out of my 8 digits is exceptionally high. A bid represents the total count across both hands. A bid of 4 4s is guaranteed true just from my hand. A bid of 5 4s requires Player 2 to have at least one 4 among their 8 digits. The probability of Player 2 having zero 4s is (9/10)^8, which is about 43%, meaning there's a ~57% chance they have at least one 4. Given my strong hand and the statistical likelihood, bidding 5 4s is a strong, justifiable opening move that puts pressure on Player 2.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 42220531, which contains three 4s. The current bid is 5 4s, so Player 3 is claiming there are at least five 4s between our two hands (16 digits total). Since I have three 4s, Player 3 would need to have at least two 4s in their hand for the bid to be valid. The probability that Player 3 has two or more 4s is not negligible, but it's not guaranteed. However, challenging at 5 4s is risky because the bid has already survived two previous challenges at this exact level, and Player 3 may be confident. To avoid elimination, it's safer to make a minimal higher bid. I will bid 5 5s, as I have one 5 in my hand and it is the lowest possible raise.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s made by Player 2. I have one 5 in my hand (94564044). This means Player 2 must have at least four 5s in their 8-digit hand for the bid to be true. With only 16 total digits, the expected count for any digit is 1.6. Player 2 needing 4 out of their 8 digits to be 5s is statistically unlikely. My previous bid was 5 4s (I have three 4s). Player 2 did not challenge this, suggesting they might not have many 4s, but bidding 5 5s immediately after seems like a potentially weak move or a bluff to push the bidding higher away from my strong suit (4s). Given the low probability of there being five or more 5s in total (requiring Player 2 to hold four), challenging is the most strategically sound action.
