Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 10858278, which contains two 8s, two 7s, and single digits of 0, 1, 2, and 5. Bidding on 8s seems reasonable as I have two of them, and with 48 total digits across 6 players, it's plausible that there are at least a few more 8s. I'll bid 3 8s to start conservatively, which is a modest increase based on my hand and leaves room for others to bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. My hand contains a 9, so bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This leverages my existing digit and follows the rules for increasing bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which is already high considering I have two and there are five other players. The probability that at least one other player has a 9 is moderate, but not certain. To play it safe, I will increase the digit to 0s (the lowest digit) while keeping the quantity the same, making my bid 3 0s. This is a conservative move that maintains the bid without significantly increasing the risk.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which is already quite high considering there are only 6 players with 8 digits each. However, since I have two 9s, it's possible that the total count is at least 3. To be safe, I will increase the bid slightly by bidding on a higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 3/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which is plausible given my hand and the fact that there are 5 other players who might have additional 9s. To make a higher bid, I can increase the quantity to 4 9s, which is still reasonable considering the total digits in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. Analyzing my hand, I have a 7 and a 3, which are not 9s. Given the bid quantity is 4, I should aim for a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. I notice that I have a 7, which is higher than 9, so I can make a bid with a higher digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. I can make a bid with a higher quantity or same quantity but higher digit. I notice that I also have a 0 in my hand, so I can make a bid with a higher digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 2. I have two 7s and one 3 in my hand. Since the current bid is for 9s, I should increase the quantity or digit. However, I don't have any 9s, and increasing the digit would be a risk. I can bid on a different digit, but I don't have enough information about other players' hands. I'll play it safe and bid on a digit I have, increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I'm starting a new round as the first bidder. Looking at my hand (98094963), I have one 9, one 8, one 0, one 4, one 9 again, one 6, and one 3. I have two 9s in my hand, which is a good starting point. Since I'm the first bidder, I should make a conservative bid that has a good chance of being true while establishing a reasonable baseline. With two 9s in my hand already, and 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total digits), I can reasonably estimate there might be around 4-5 9s total in all hands. Starting with a bid of 4 9s seems strategic - it's based on what I know I have, and it's a high digit which makes it harder for others to increase without changing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 6 and no 9s in my hand. Given that there are 40 digits in total and 4 players other than me have bid, it's possible that there are 4 or more 9s. However, bidding higher seems safer than challenging. I can bid 5 9s, increasing the quantity, which is a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:0 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, which is concerning since the current bid is 5 9s made by Player 5. With only 40 total digits across 5 players, each having 8 digits, the bid of 5 9s is possible but on the lower side of likelihood. However, since I have zero 9s, it reduces the probability from my perspective that there are at least 5 9s in total. On average, each player might have about 0.8 of each digit (40 digits / 10 possible digits / 5 players), so 5 9s would require a significant concentration among the other players. I could bid higher, such as 6 0s or 5 0s, but since I also have no 0s, that feels risky. Given my lack of 9s, I think challenging the bid is a reasonable choice, as it seems unlikely to me that there are 5 or more 9s in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None' as it's the start of the round and I am Player 5. I have to make the first bid. My hand is 06863714, which contains one 0, one 1, two 6s, two 3s, one 7, and one 4. I see that I have two 6s. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but also consider the digits I have. Bidding on 6s seems plausible because I have two of them. Starting with a quantity of 5 or 6 for 6s could be a good strategy, but since I'm starting, I'll be conservative and bid 4 6s, considering there are 3 other players who might also have 6s.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s. Bidding 5 4s increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages the higher quantity while using a digit I know exists in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 5 4s. Given that there are 32 total digits and I have two 5s, it's possible that there are at least 5 4s in the game, but the risk is high. I can safely bid 5 5s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:5 - claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. My hand (98094963) contains zero 5s, which is important since the current bid is 5 5s. With 4 active players having 8 digits each, there are 32 total digits in play. For the bid of 5 5s to be valid, the other 3 players would need to have at least 5 5s among them, averaging 1.67 5s per player. This isn't unreasonable. Looking at my options: I could bid 6 5s, but since I have no 5s, that's risky. I could bid 5 6s (same quantity, higher digit), which is safer since I have one 6 in my hand. I could also bid 5 7s or higher, or increase the quantity to 6 of a lower digit. Since I have one 9, one 8, one 6, two 9s, one 4, and one 3, bidding 5 6s seems reasonable as I'm contributing one toward that count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (06863714), so I know there are at least 2 6s. With 32 total digits and 4 players, it's plausible that there are more 6s. I can either challenge or bid higher. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since I have two 6s, bidding 6 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, bidding 5 7s is also an option as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit. However, since I'm confident in my hand having two 6s and the total count being potentially higher, I'll choose to bid 6 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. With 32 total digits, the average number of 6s per player is 3.2. Since I have no 6s and others may not have enough, this bid is likely overestimated. Challenging reduces the risk of being forced into a higher bid with insufficient digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains three 4s. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid that reflects my hand's highest frequency (3 4s) is logical. This establishes a baseline for subsequent bids.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s. Since I have a pair of 5s, it's reasonable to assume there might be at least one more 5 among the other players' hands (Player 1 and Player 4). Therefore, I can safely bid 3 5s, which is a higher bid than 3 4s because the digit is higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (98094963), I have zero 5s. Player 2 has bid 3 5s, meaning they believe there are at least 3 fives among all players. Since I have none, all 3+ would need to be between Player 1 and Player 2 (each with 8 digits). This is possible but not guaranteed. I could challenge, but it's a bit risky as the bid is still relatively low. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have one 6 and one 9 in my hand. I'll bid 3 6s, which is higher than 3 5s by increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity. This is reasonably safe since I already have one 6, so I only need Player 1 and Player 2 to have 2 more 6s between them to make this valid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand (95424433). Player 2 would need at least two 5s to make the bid valid.
