Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 8 digits, I have: two 2s, two 3s, two 7s, one 8, and one 9. Since I'm opening the bidding, I should start conservatively but with a digit I know exists in decent quantity in my hand. Having two 3s gives me confidence to bid three 3s total across all players, as it's likely other players also have some 3s in their 40 remaining digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 30911844, which contains one 3. The current bid is 3 3s, meaning there must be at least three 3s among all 48 digits. With 6 players and 8 digits each, it is likely that there are at least three 3s, so challenging now would be risky. I will make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 4, since I have two 4s in my hand, making 3 4s a reasonable and safe next bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have two 6s in my hand. I know that there are at least 3 of each digit from 0-3. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit. This feels like a safe bet with a high chance of being correct.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 43830753, which contains no 6s. The current bid is 4 6s by Player 2. With 48 total digits across 6 players, it's possible that there are at least 4 6s in play, as each player has 8 digits. However, since I have none, I estimate the likelihood based on average distribution. On average, each digit (0-9) should appear about 4.8 times across all hands (48 digits / 10 possible digits). A bid of 4 6s is slightly below this average, so it's plausible. I could challenge, but it's risky as the bid isn't excessively high. Instead, I'll make a safer bid by increasing the quantity to 5 and choosing a digit I have in my hand to make my bid more believable. I have two 3s, so bidding 5 3s feels reasonable.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have one 3 in my hand, so challenging is not the most obvious move as 5 3s is close to the average expectation (4.8) across 48 digits. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 1s, which is the digit I have the most of. Bidding 6 1s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity than 5 3s). Given I have two 1s, this bid requires 4 more 1s from the other 5 players (40 digits), which is exactly the average expectation (40 * 0.1 = 4). This makes 6 1s a plausible bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have only one 1 in my hand (97233872). The current bid claims there are 7 ones total among 48 digits (6 players Ã— 8 digits). While possible, this seems unlikely given: 1) I only have one 1, 2) The bidding has escalated quickly to 7 ones, suggesting possible bluffing, 3) For there to be 6 more ones among other players seems statistically improbable. Making a higher bid would be very risky as it would require either 8 ones or switching to a higher digit with 7 of them. Given these factors, challenging is the safer option.

Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 3 and two 7s. With 5 players having 8 digits each (40 total), a conservative opening bid is wise. Since I know there's at least one 3, and threes have been common in previous rounds, starting with '3 3s' is a reasonable opening bid that leaves room for others while being likely true based on my knowledge.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 30911844, which contains two 1s, two 4s, one 0, one 3, one 8, and one 9. The current bid is 3 3s. With 5 players and 40 digits in play, it's early in the round and the bid is low. I can safely make a higher bid based on my hand. I have two 4s, so bidding 3 4s is a safe, strictly higher bid (same quantity, higher digit).

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. I have to make a bid higher than 3 4s. In the previous rounds, I see that 3 3s and 5 3s were made. This indicates that there may be a significant number of 3s in other players' hands. However, I do not have any 3s or 4s in my hand. I do have two 6s, so I could bid 4 6s, but that was my bid in the previous round and it might be risky to bid the same number again. I could also bid 3 7s, but I do not have any 7s. I could bid 3 5s, but that is not higher than the current bid. I could bid 3 8s, but I only have one 8, so it is risky. I could bid 4 0s, but I do not have any 0s. I could bid 3 9s, but I do not have any 9s. I could bid 4 2s, but I do not have any 2s. I could bid 3 1s, but 6 1s and 7 1s were bid in the previous round, and 7 1s was challenged and lost, indicating that there are not many 1s left. I could bid 4 5s, but I do not have any 5s. The safest bid seems to be 3 8s, as I have one 8 and it is unlikely that there are three 8s in total.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 43830753, which contains two 3s and one 8. The current bid is 3 8s by Player 2. Since I have one 8, and there are 40 total digits across 5 players, it's plausible that there are at least two more 8s among the other 32 digits. Challenging seems risky as the bid is low and reasonable. Instead, I will make a higher bid. I can bid 3 9s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This is a safe incremental bid to avoid overcommitting while still progressing the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand contains zero 9s. Based on probability, there is still a significant chance (around 60%) that 3 or more 9s exist among the other 4 players' 32 digits, making a challenge risky. I must make a higher bid. My hand contains two 1s. Bidding 4 1s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity). This requires at least two more 1s from the remaining 32 digits, which is highly probable (expected count is 3.2, and the probability of getting at least 2 is high). This is a safer bid than bidding 4 of a digit I only have one of (requiring 3 more) or a digit I have none of (requiring 4 more).

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (97233872), I have only one 1. The current bid of 4 1s by Player 4 seems reasonable given there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total digits). In the previous round, we saw there were 6 1s total with 6 players (48 digits), so it's likely there are around 4-5 1s now with 5 players. Given this information and my single 1, I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. I have three 3s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid 5 1s, increasing the quantity while staying within plausible limits.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 30911844, which contains two 1s. The current bid is 5 1s, meaning there must be at least five 1s among all 40 digits. I know there are two in my hand, so there need to be at least three more among the other 32 digits. Statistically, each digit appears about 4 times (32/10 â‰ˆ 3.2), so it's plausible there are at least three more 1s. Therefore, challenging is not optimal. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and choose a higher digit. Since I have two 4s in my hand, I'll bid '5 4s' to stay competitive and leverage my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have two 6s in my hand. Since 5 4s is a valid bid (as it was not challenged), there are at least 5 fours among all players. Bidding 6 6s seems reasonable, as it increases both the quantity and the digit, and I have two 6s in my hand, suggesting that there might be enough 6s among all players.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 43830753, which contains no 6s. The current bid is 6 6s by Player 2. With 5 players and 40 total digits, an average of 4 of each digit is expected across all hands. A bid of 6 6s is slightly above average but plausible. However, since I have no 6s in my hand, the remaining 32 digits from other players must contain all 6 of the bid 6s. This seems somewhat unlikely but not impossible. I could challenge, but the risk is high as the bid isn't excessively out of range. Instead, Iâ€™ll make a safer bid. I have two 3s in my hand, and the bidding history shows some focus on lower digits. Iâ€™ll bid 6 7s to increase the digit while maintaining the quantity, as itâ€™s a reasonable escalation without overcommitting.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s, made by Player 3. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected number of any specific digit is 40 / 10 = 4. A bid of 6 is significantly above this expected value. The probability of having 6 or more 7s in 40 digits (assuming random distribution) is approximately 25%. Therefore, the probability that the bid is false (less than 6 7s) is approximately 75%. Challenging this bid offers a high probability of winning and eliminating a player.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s, made by Player 2. There are 4 players remaining with 8 digits each, totaling 32 digits. The average count for any single digit is 3.2 (32 / 10). A bid of 5 6s is significantly above this average. My hand contains zero 6s, meaning the other three players must hold at least five 6s among their 24 digits for the bid to be true. Based on probability (approximately 20-21% chance of having 5 or more 6s in 32 digits), challenging this bid has a high likelihood of success (around 79-80% chance of the actual count being less than 5). While Player 2 might have a strong hand of 6s, the bid is high enough, and my lack of 6s provides no support for raising the bid further on 6s or a higher quantity.
