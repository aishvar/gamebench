Player 0 Reasoning: Since no previous bid has been made, I can start with a safe initial bid. I have two '1's in my hand, so bidding '2 1s' seems reasonable as a starting point. This bid is low enough to be plausible and encourages others to bid higher or challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. My hand contains a 2, and bidding 2 2s is a valid move that increases the digit while keeping the same quantity. This leverages my existing digits without risking an immediate challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 65091029, which contains no 2s. The current bid is 2 2s by Player 1. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an average of 4.8 digits per digit value (0-9) is expected across all hands. A bid of 2 2s is quite low and likely to be true, so challenging seems risky. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. I have two 0s in my hand, so bidding 3 0s feels safe as it increases the quantity and changes the digit. This bid is higher than 2 2s as the quantity is greater, and it leverages some information from my own hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. In my hand (94661751), I have zero 0s. Statistically, with 48 digits in play and 10 possible digits, the expected number of 0s is about 4.8, so 3 0s is a conservative bid. Since I have no 0s, I cannot safely challenge, as it's likely that there are at least 3 0s among all hands. I can make a higher bid. I have two 1s in my hand, so I will bid 3 1s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand of 60435496, I have only one 1. The current bid of '3 1s' claims there are at least 3 ones total. Given there are 6 players with 8 digits each, and I can only see my hand, this is a reasonable bid. With 47 unknown digits and only needing 2 more 1s somewhere, I should not challenge. I can safely bid '3 2s', keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit. This is conservative since I have one 2 in my hand already.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 73501379. I have zero 2s. The current bid is 3 2s. Given that there are 6 players with 8 digits each (48 total digits), the average occurrence of any digit is 4.8.  A bid of 3 2s is slightly below average, but I have no 2s to support it.  Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, two 3s, and one of 5, 0, 1, and 9. Bidding on 7s or 3s seems more plausible.  A bid of 3 3s or 3 7s would be valid as it's the same quantity but a higher digit.  A bid of 4 of any digit would also be valid. Given my two 7s, bidding 3 7s is a reasonable step up from 3 2s and is supported by my hand, while not being an overly aggressive jump.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand, which makes the total count of 7s at most 1. Bidding higher with 4 7s is impossible because I only hold one 7. Alternatively, increasing the digit from 7 to 8 with the same quantity (3) is also not feasible, as I do not have any 8s. Challenging the current bid of 3 7s seems prudent because the actual count of 7s across all hands is unlikely to reach 3, given my hand and the distribution. Challenging is the best move to potentially eliminate the previous bidder if they overbid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round. My hand contains two 7s, two 3s, one 5, one 0, one 1, and one 9. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. I have two 7s, which is below average, but a bid of 2 7s is a safe starting bid that reflects my hand strength in 7s.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 65091029, which contains no 7s. The current bid is 3 7s by Player 1. With 5 players and 40 total digits, it's possible that there are at least 3 7s across all hands, especially since the previous round had 6 7s with 6 players. Bidding higher is safer than challenging at this point. I have two 0s in my hand, so bidding 4 0s feels reasonable as it increases the quantity and changes the digit to something I have some confidence in.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 94661751, which contains 0 zeros. The current bid is 4 0s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in play. Statistically, each digit appears about 4 times, but I have none, so the remaining 32 digits among 4 players would need to contain all 4 zeros. This is plausible but not certain. However, since I have no zeros, it's risky to challenge now. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 6s, one 4, one 5, one 7, and one 9. Bidding 4 1s is reasonable since I have two myself, and the expected number in the other hands should cover the rest.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand. With 5 players and 8 digits each (40 total), Player 3's bid of '4 1s' is plausible but not certain. However, since I only have one 1, and we need at least 3 more 1s among the other players' hands, I think challenging would be risky. I can see two 0s in my hand, so I can safely bid '4 2s' - same quantity but higher digit. This is a conservative move that keeps me in the game while increasing the pressure on others.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 73501379. I have two 7s, two 3s, one 5, one 0, one 1, and one 9. The current bid is 4 2s.  I have no 2s in my hand.  With 5 players remaining and 40 total digits, a bid of 4 2s is only slightly above the expected average (40 total digits / 10 possible digits = 4 expected per digit).  However, without any 2s in my hand, I don't feel confident in a higher bid on 2s or a significantly higher bid on other digits. Given the history of aggressive bidding in the previous round, challenging 4 2s seems like a reasonable risk, especially since I don't contribute to that count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s by Player 1. I have no 7s in my hand (65091029), which means I contribute nothing to the count of 7s. With 32 total digits across 4 players, the maximum possible number of 7s is 32, but it's unlikely that the other three players have enough 7s to make the total at least 3. However, looking at the history, bids on 7s have been made repeatedly, and in a previous round, a bid of 3 7s was successful with an actual count of 6. This suggests that there might be a few 7s in other players' hands. Still, since I have none, I’m skeptical about the bid. On the other hand, I have two 0s in my hand, so bidding 4 0s feels safer as I contribute to that count. I’ll make a higher bid instead of challenging, as the risk of challenging is high given past outcomes with 7s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. In my hand (94661751), I have zero 0s. Statistically, with 32 digits among 4 players, the expected number of any digit is about 3.2. Bidding 4 0s is already above expectation, and I have none in my hand, making it unlikely the total is 4 or more. Challenging here is strong, as the likelihood of there being at least 4 zeros is low.

Player 2 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet in this round and I am starting the bidding, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand is 65091029, which gives me two 0s, two 9s, and one each of 6, 5, 1, and 2. With a total of 24 digits across three players, I’ll bid on a digit I have some of to make it believable. Bidding 3 0s seems reasonable as I have two 0s myself, and it's likely there is at least one more 0 among the other 16 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 73501379. I have one 0.  The current bid is 3 0s. With 3 players and 8 digits each (24 total), the expected number of any digit is 24 / 10 = 2.4.  A bid of 3 0s is slightly above the average expectation, but not wildly so.  Given my hand has one 0, and I know there's at least one more 0 out there for the bid to be true, it's not a guaranteed win to challenge.  I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid and is supported by my hand and the previous round where 3 7s was a true bid.  Bidding 4 0s would be a higher bid but I only have one 0, making it riskier. Bidding 3 1s, 3 2s, 3 3s, 3 5s, 3 7s, or 3 9s are all valid options. Bidding 3 7s leverages the strength in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s by Player 1. In my hand (65091029), I have no 7s, which means I contribute nothing to the count of 7s. With only 24 total digits across 3 players, a bid of 4 7s means that the other two players would need to have at least 4 7s combined in their 16 digits. Given the bidding history, Player 5 and Player 1 have shown a tendency to bid on 7s, which might indicate they have some in their hands. In the last round, there were at least 3 7s based on previous bids and outcomes, but with one player eliminated since then, the count might be lower now. However, since I have no 7s, I estimate the likelihood of there being 4 or more 7s as moderate but not extremely high. I could challenge, but it's risky since it's plausible. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. I have two 0s in my hand, and previously a bid of 4 0s was successful, so I’ll bid 5 0s, increasing the quantity, as it seems a safer move than challenging.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s by Player 1. In my hand (65091029), I have no 7s, which means I contribute nothing to the count. With only 24 total digits across 3 players, a bid of 5 7s means that the other two players would need to have a significant number of 7s for this to be true (e.g., an average of 2.5 per player). Looking at the bidding history, Player 1 and Player 5 have consistently bid on 7s, which might indicate they have some, but 5 still feels high given I have none. I could raise the bid to 6 0s since I have three 0s in my hand, which is a strong position, and the total count might be plausible. However, pushing the bid higher might invite a challenge, and I want to be cautious. Alternatively, challenging 5 7s could be a good move if I believe it's unlikely. Given the risk and my lack of 7s, I think challenging is safer than escalating the bid further at this point.

Player 2 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I must make a starting bid. My hand is 65091029, which gives me digits with counts: two 0s, one 1, one 2, one 5, one 6, and one 9. With only two players left and a total of 16 digits, I should start with a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 3 0s seems reasonable as I have two 0s myself, and it's possible the other player has at least one 0. This keeps the bid low enough to avoid an immediate challenge while still advancing the game.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 73501379. The current bid is 3 0s by Player 2. I have one 0 in my hand. With 16 total digits, the average count for any digit is 1.6. Player 2's bid of 3 0s is already above average. While it's possible Player 2 has two or more 0s, challenging seems reasonable given the limited number of digits and my hand composition. Bidding higher would require a quantity of at least 4 or a digit higher than 0 at the same quantity. I only have one 0, so bidding 4 0s is unlikely. I have two 7s and two 3s, but bidding 3 7s or 3 3s would still be a low bid compared to the current 3 0s. Challenging the 3 0s seems like the best strategic move at this point.
