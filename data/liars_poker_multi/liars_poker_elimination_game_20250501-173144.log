Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since I'm the first to bid, I need to make a strategic opening bid. Looking at my hand (51338128), I have two 1s, two 3s, and two 8s. I should bid based on what I have in my hand to increase the chances my bid is valid. Starting with a moderate bid is best - not too high to be easily challenged, but high enough to put pressure on other players. I'll bid 5 8s since I have two 8s in my hand, meaning I only need 3 more 8s among the other 5 players (40 remaining digits), which is quite reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 8s and my hand containing one 8, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least five 8s among all active players. Since each player has 8 digits and there are 6 players, the maximum number of any digit is 48. With my single 8, I need at least four more 8s from the other players to meet the current bid. Considering the random distribution of digits, it's plausible but not guaranteed. However, given that I only have one 8 and the relatively low quantity of the current bid, challenging seems like a viable option. But, since my hand does contain an 8, which supports the bid to some extent, and given the early stage of the game where players might be cautious, I will opt to make a higher bid instead of challenging, aiming to increase the quantity while keeping the digit the same or moving to a higher digit if I have sufficient evidence from my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I have only one 8 in my hand (digit '8' appears once). To beat the bid, I need at least 7 8s or a higher digit with 6 or more. Since I only have one 8, it's impossible to reach 7 8s. Bidding higher on 8s is risky because the total number of 8s in all hands is unlikely to reach 7. The next higher digit after 8 is 9, but I have no 9s. Given the limited information and my hand, challenging seems like the best move, as the bid of 6 8s is probably overstated.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current state of the game with no previous bids in this round and my hand being 27279347, I notice I have two 7s and no 8s or 9s. The last bid in the previous round was a challenge to 6 8s, which was won by the bidder, indicating a significant presence of 8s. However, since I have no 8s and the game has progressed, bidding on a higher digit than 8 might not be wise without more information. Bidding on 7s seems reasonable since I have two of them, and it's a relatively safe bet considering the distribution of digits. Given that I'm starting the bidding, I should aim for a quantity that is plausible and encourages further bidding without being too risky. Thus, bidding 4 7s seems like a balanced approach, considering my hand and the fact that we are starting fresh with 40 digits remaining.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s, which is the average expected count for a digit with 40 total digits remaining. Challenging this bid is risky as it is quite likely to be true. My hand contains two 8s. Bidding 5 8s is a valid higher bid, increasing the quantity. This bid is plausible as I have two 8s and need only three more from the remaining 32 digits across 4 players. This seems like a reasonable and strategic move based on my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round. My hand contains two 8s. With 4 players and 8 digits each, there are 32 total digits. The average expected count for any digit is 3.2. Bidding '3 8s' is a conservative opening bid, slightly above my personal count for 8s and below the statistical average across all hands. This is a reasonable starting point for the bidding.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have the digits 13760584, which includes one 8. So, my hand contributes to the count of 8s. Considering there are 3 other players and 24 digits remaining from their hands, it's plausible that there are at least 2 more 8s. Thus, the total count of 8s could be around 3. However, I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I can see that increasing the digit is a safer option. I will bid 3 9s, as it's a relatively safe increase in digit without significantly increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '3 9s'. Looking at my hand (51338128), I have zero 9s. With 4 active players having 8 digits each, there are 32 total digits in play. For the bid '3 9s' to be valid, at least 3 of the 24 digits held by other players must be 9s. This means roughly 1/8 of their digits would need to be 9s, which is possible but not guaranteed. However, since I have zero 9s in my hand, and Player 5 made this bid confidently, they likely have at least some 9s. I could make a higher bid like '4 0s' or '4 1s' based on the digits in my hand (I have one 1 and zero 0s), but this would be risky. Given that I don't have any 9s to support the current bid, challenging seems more reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. My hand is 13760584, which contains the digits 1, 3, 7, 6, 0, 5, 8, 4. I have one 8 and no 9s. A reasonable starting bid could be based on the most frequent digit in my hand or a digit I think might be common. I have one 5 and it's a relatively high digit, so bidding on 5s could be a good start. Considering there are 3 players and 24 digits in total, bidding 8 5s seems too high. A more conservative bid like 5 5s or 6 5s could be reasonable. However, since I'm starting, I'll go with a lower quantity. I see that I have one 5, so if the other players have a similar distribution, 3 5s could be a plausible bid. It's a cautious start, and I can adjust based on the next player's bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 5s and my hand of 27279347, I notice I have no 5s. Since the total digits remaining are 24 and we are down to 3 players, each having 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 24. Considering I have no 5s, I must rely on the probability and the bidding history. The bidding history shows that players have been bidding and challenging reasonably, with outcomes often favoring the bidder when the counts were close or exactly met the bid quantity. Given that I have no 5s and the bid is relatively low at 3 5s, I need to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. Since my hand contains digits that could potentially be bid upon (like the 7s, of which I have two), I should consider if bidding higher on a different digit or challenging is more strategic. However, without more information on the other players' hands and given the low quantity of the current bid, challenging seems like a risky move unless I have a strong reason to believe the bid is unlikely. Given my hand and the fact that I don't have any 5s, but also considering the relatively low bid, I might consider bidding higher on a digit I have more of, like the 7s or even the 3s and 4s which I also have in my hand. But since I need to bid strictly higher than 3 5s and I don't have enough of any single digit to confidently bid higher on those, my best move considering the need for a strict increase and the digits I hold is to consider the challenge based on the unlikeliness of the bid given my lack of 5s and the overall distribution of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 27279347, I have two 7s and no other digit appears more than twice. Since the total number of digits remaining is 16 and there are only two players, the maximum possible count for any digit is 16. Considering the distribution of my hand and the fact that I have two 7s, bidding on 7s seems like a reasonable starting point. However, I should start with a conservative bid to avoid overestimating. Bidding 3 7s seems like a balanced choice, considering my hand and leaving room for Player 3's potential contribution to the total count.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s, made by Player 1. My hand contains zero 7s. For the bid of 3 7s to be true, Player 1 must hold at least three 7s in their 8-digit hand.
