Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 4s. Since there's no current bid, starting with a bid that reflects my hand's highest count (2 4s) is logical. This establishes a baseline for the game.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have one 4 (from 45116826) in my hand, so I know there are at least 1 + unknown others = at least 1 four. With 5 other players and 8 digits each, there's a reasonable chance there are more 4s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s, I can reasonably assume there might be other 6s. Bidding 2 6s is a safe increase in digit without overstating the quantity.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s made by Player 1. I have the digits 1, 7, 9, 4, 8, 8, 2, 6 in my hand, which includes one 6. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 6, bidding a higher digit seems more reasonable. I will bid 3 7s, increasing both the quantity and the digit based on my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (digit 7). To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit. Since 3 8s is higher than 3 7s, I will bid 3 8s. This bid is reasonable because there could be at least three 8s among all players, and I have one 8 in my hand, supporting the plausibility of the bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which is very likely valid given I hold two 8s. To push the bid safely higher, I can bid 4 1s. I need two more 1s among the 40 unknown digits, which has about a 92% chance. This both raises the quantity and leverages my known 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s, and I need to bid higher. Looking at my hand (69756473), I have one 1, which makes a bid of 4 1s unlikely. The highest count of 1s in my hand is just 1. To beat 4 1s, I must either bid a higher quantity of 1s or a higher digit. Since I only have one 1, I cannot bid more than 1 1s. Therefore, challenging the current bid is the best move, as the total number of 1s across all hands is unlikely to reach 4.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With 40 total digits, the expected count of any digit is 4, so bidding 3 8s is below expectation and safe. Starting with 3 8s forces opponents to either bid 3 9s or raise the quantity, giving me control.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand (53481942). The current bid is 3 8s. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid since it maintains the same quantity (3) but uses a higher digit (9 > 8). This leverages my existing 9 while adhering to the rules.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (from 45116826). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll base my decision on my hand and the current bid. I can bid 4 9s because increasing the quantity is a valid move. Alternatively, I could bid 3 0s is not higher in digit, but I can consider bidding with the same quantity on a higher digit isn't possible here as 9 is the highest digit. Given that I have one 9, bidding 4 9s seems plausible as it is a relatively conservative increase in quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 1. I have 8 secret digits: 17948826. I can see that bidding higher than 4 9s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains two 6s and one 8, I don't have any 9s. I should consider if challenging is more beneficial or if I can make a reasonable bid. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40 and there are 40 total digits remaining, a bid of 5 0s seems reasonable and higher than 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s, which means at least five zeros exist among all players' hands. I have one zero in my hand (34487269). The previous bid was 4 9s, and now the bid increased to 5 0s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since 5 is the current quantity, I can bid 5 1s or higher digits, or increase the quantity to 6 with any digit. I have one '4' and one '7' in my hand, but no '1's. Given the previous bids and my hand, bidding 5 1s is a reasonable next step as it is higher than 5 0s and plausible. Bidding 6 0s or more may be risky without more zeros in my hand. Therefore, I will bid 5 1s.

Player 4 Reasoning: Challenging 5 1s would only have ~37% chance of success given I hold two 1s. Instead I raise to 5 8s: I have two 8s and among the other 32 digits I expect ~3.2 more (Binomial pâ‰ˆ0.1), giving ~63% chance that at least three others exist. This is the smallest valid increase on the digit with good odds.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. My hand contains a 9, so bidding 5 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This leverages my existing digits and follows the rules for increasing the bid.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have the digits 45116826, which means I have no 9s. Given that there are 5 players and each has 8 digits, the total count of any digit cannot exceed 40. The current bid of 5 9s implies that there are at least five 9s in total. I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have any 9s, and the quantity is already 5, I can either bid 6 of any digit or 5 of a higher digit than 9, which is not possible since 9 is the highest digit. I can bid 6 0s. Before doing that, I should assess the likelihood of the current bid being true. Given that Player 0 made the bid and I don't have any 9s, it's possible they have some. However, bidding 5 9s is a relatively high bid considering the total number of digits is 40. I should consider if it's likely or not. Since I can bid higher and there's a chance that others might have 9s, I'll make a higher bid by increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s made by Player 1. I have 8 secret digits: 17948826. I see one 0 in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are 40 digits in total. The bid of 6 0s seems high but not impossible. However, I don't have enough information about other players' hands. I will bid higher than 6 0s. A reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity or the digit. Since 6 0s is a high bid for 0s, increasing the digit seems prudent. I will bid 6 1s as I have a 1 and a 2 and other digits could potentially add up.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have one '1' in my hand. The bid is quite high for digit '1' given there are 40 digits total. However, the previous bids have been steadily increasing, and the digit '1' is common. To stay in the game, I need to make a valid higher bid. Increasing the digit to '2' while keeping the quantity at 6 is valid and likely safer than increasing the quantity. I have no '2's in my hand, but bidding 6 2s is still plausible given the distribution.

Player 4 Reasoning: I hold two 2s, and among the other 32 digits I expect about 3.2 more, for an expected total of 5.2 2s. The chance of there being at least six 2s is only around 40%, making the bid of 6 2s unlikely. I should challenge.

Given that there are 32 total digits remaining across 4 players, the maximum possible count for any digit is 32. The current bid of 3 5s seems plausible but not extremely high. I can see that bidding 4 6s would be a reasonable move as it increases both the quantity and the digit based on my hand. I have two 6s, which makes 4 6s a believable bid.

Given there are 32 digits total and four players, having at least four 6s is plausible. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have the hand 45116826, which contains one 8. So, my count for 8s is 1. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have two 6s, I can consider bidding on a higher digit. However, I should assess the likelihood of the current bid being true. With 32 total digits and one 8 in my hand, the remaining 3 players must have at least 3 more 8s to meet the bid of 4 8s. This seems plausible but not certain. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 5 8s or 4 9s are both valid options. Given that I have no 9s, bidding 4 9s seems risky. However, it's a safer increase in digit rather than quantity. I will choose to bid 4 9s as it's a reasonable increase in digit.

The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. Since the bid is 4 9s, and I have one 9, I need to assess if this bid is likely or not. If I challenge and win, I eliminate Player 1. If I lose, I get eliminated. I should consider my hand and the bids made so far. The bids have been increasing in quantity or digit, but 4 9s seems high given that only one player has shown a 9 so far.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. The previous bids show a cautious progression in quantity and digit. To raise the bid validly, I must bid at least 4 7s or higher. I have one 7 in my hand as well. Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable and valid move given my hand and the current bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand contains an 8, so bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This leverages my existing digit and follows the rules for increasing the bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 0. I have the hand 17948826, which contains two 6s and one 8. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and there are 24 digits in total, bidding a higher quantity or digit requires careful consideration. Since my previous bids of 4 6s and 4 8s were matched, I should consider if challenging is more strategic. However, I can see that bidding 5 6s would be a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Considering there are 24 digits total, 5 sixes is plausible but somewhat high. The previous bids have gradually increased, and I currently hold no 7s or 8s to support bidding those digits. The next valid bid must be higher than 5 6s, so either 5 7s or 6 0s or higher. Since I have one 7, bidding 5 7s is a minimal increase and somewhat reasonable. However, bidding 6 0s would be a larger jump and risky. Given the current bid and my hand, challenging seems risky as 5 sixes is possible. Therefore, I will bid 5 7s to increase the bid slightly and maintain pressure.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. My hand contains one 8, and bidding 5 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This leverages the fact that the digit 8 is higher than 7, and I have at least one 8 in my hand. Challenging would require assuming the actual count of 7s is less than 5, which is uncertain without more information. Bidding 5 8s is a strategic move to increase the stakes while staying within the rules.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s made by Player 0. Given that I have 8 secret digits: 17948826, I can count my own digits to assess the feasibility of the bid. I have one 8 and no other 8s are visible in my hand. With 24 total digits remaining across 3 players, and assuming the other players could have a maximum of 8 each, the bid of 5 8s seems highly unlikely but not impossible. However, I must consider my own hand and possible distributions. I will challenge the bid as it seems unlikely.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current round has just started with no bids yet. I have 8 secret digits: 17948826. I see that I have two 6s in my hand. Since the current bid is 'None', I can make any bid that seems reasonable based on my hand and the total digits remaining (16). Bidding 2 6s seems like a conservative and valid start, considering I have two 6s and there are 16 digits in total.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can bid 2 7s or increase the quantity. I have one 7 as well. Bidding 2 7s is a safe incremental bid based on my hand and the current bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s made by Player 3. I have a 6 and a 7 in my hand. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 16 digits in total for both players, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding 3 6s would be a reasonable increase based on my hand and the current bid. Alternatively, challenging seems tempting because 2 7s might be unlikely given the distribution of digits, but I need to be cautious. Given my hand and the need to make a strictly higher bid, I will bid 3 7s to increase the quantity.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit. The next higher digit at quantity 3 is 8. However, bidding 3 8s seems risky since I have no 8s in my hand. Increasing the quantity to 4 with the lowest digit (0) is possible but seems risky given the current bids. Since the previous bids reached 5 8s and were challenged successfully, the current bid of 3 7s is quite reasonable. I do not have strong evidence to challenge, so I will bid conservatively by increasing the digit to 3 8s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 3. I have the hand 17948826, which contains one 8. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players with 8 digits each, the maximum possible count for any digit is 16. I have one 6, three 7s, and one 8. Bidding 4 7s seems reasonable as it's higher than the current bid of 3 8s in terms of quantity and I have the digits to support it.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have two 7s in my hand (positions 2 and 4). Given there are 16 digits total, having at least four 7s is plausible. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. I do not have any 8s, but the next higher digit after 7 is 8. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid and keeps the quantity the same. This is a reasonable move to keep the game going while slightly increasing the bid.
