Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand. With 40 unknown digits among the other players, the expected count of 0s there is about 4, giving a total expectation of 7 zeros. Opening with 5 zeros is a safe conservative bid that leverages my strong holding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 0s, I need to make a strictly higher bid. Looking at my hand, 99792581, I notice I have one 9 and no 0s. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48 and we're starting with a relatively low bid, there's room for strategic bidding. Considering my hand and the fact that bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity or increasing the quantity for a lower digit are both valid moves, I should aim to balance between being competitive and not overbidding. Given that I have a 9, which is the highest digit, bidding on it seems like a strong move because it immediately jumps to the highest possible digit, making it harder for others to follow without having a significant number of 9s in their hands.

Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 0s, I need to make a strictly higher bid. Since I have two 9s in my hand (99792581), and considering the total number of digits remaining is 48, bidding on a higher digit seems reasonable. Increasing the quantity or the digit would make a valid bid. Given that 0s are less likely to be abundant due to the nature of the game favoring higher digits in initial bids, and I don't have any 0s, I will choose to increase the digit, looking for a balance between being competitive and not overbidding.

Player 1 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 99792581, I notice I have two 9s. Since the goal is to make a valid higher bid and considering the total digits remaining is 40, bidding on a high digit like 9 seems strategic. With two 9s in my hand, I can reasonably assume there might be more 9s among the other players, given the distribution of digits. Thus, bidding 3 9s seems like a cautious yet potentially winning start, as it's high enough to be challenging for others to surpass without risking an immediate challenge due to the bid being too high.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 1. I have 8 secret digits in my hand: 13564232. I can see that I have one 9 in my hand. Given that there are 4 other active players and each has 8 digits, the total number of digits is 40. The bid of 3 9s seems plausible but not extremely high. However, I do not have enough information about other players' hands. I will make a bid that is higher than 3 9s. Since I have one 9, bidding 4 9s seems reasonable if I think others might have at least two 9s in total.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I don't have any 9s in my hand. To bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. I could bid 5 0s, but that seems weak. I'll bid 5 1s. This is a safe bid while increasing the quantity.

Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The current bid is '5 1s' made by Player 4. Looking at my hand (08558586), I have zero 1s. In the previous round, a bid of '5 1s' was proven to be exactly correct with 6 players (48 total digits). Now we have 5 players (40 total digits), so there are fewer total digits in play. Since I have no 1s in my hand, there would need to be at least 5 1s among the other 4 players' 32 digits. This is possible but not guaranteed. I could challenge, but it's risky. Alternatively, I could make a higher bid. I have three 5s and two 8s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on these digits. I'll bid '5 5s' since I already have 3 of them in my hand, so I only need 2 more among the other 32 digits, which is quite likely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding this round. Looking at my hand (08558586), I have three 5s and two 8s. Since I have a good number of 5s in my hand, I should leverage this knowledge. If I have three 5s out of eight digits, other players might have similar distributions. A reasonable opening bid would be 6 5s, suggesting there are at least 6 fives among all 32 digits. This is conservative enough to be safe while still making a competitive opening bid based on my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 6 5s and my hand of 99792581, I notice I don't have any 5s. However, I do have two 9s. Since the current bid is about 5s and I have no 5s, challenging seems risky without knowing the actual distribution of 5s among other players. Considering the bidding history, players have been somewhat conservative, and the fact that we are down to 32 total digits with 4 players remaining, I should aim for a digit that I have a better grasp of. Given that I have two 9s, bidding on 9s seems like a safer bet. Since the current bid is 6 5s, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit from 5 to 9 (since I have 9s in my hand) while keeping the quantity the same or slightly higher could be a good strategy. Thus, bidding 6 9s seems reasonable as it increases the digit, leveraging my hand's composition, and maintains a quantity that is not excessively high given the total digits remaining.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s made by Player 1. I, Player 3, have 8 secret digits but do not know the exact distribution of digits among other players. My hand contains one 9. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 32 total digits remaining, bidding a quantity higher than 6 for a digit seems risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding a higher digit with the same quantity or slightly higher could be strategic. Since my hand has one 9, and I aim to make a valid higher bid, I should consider increasing either the quantity or the digit. The digit 9 is already high, so increasing the quantity seems more feasible. Bidding 7 9s would be a straightforward increase in quantity.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. I have two 8s and two 7s, but no 9s. To make a valid bid, I need to bid higher than 7 9s. I can bid 8 of any digit, or 7 of a digit higher than 9 (which is not possible). Therefore, I must bid at least 8 of any digit. Given my hand, bidding 8 1s seems like a reasonable option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '8 1s' made by Player 4. Looking at my hand (08558586), I have 0 ones. There are 32 total digits in play (8 digits × 4 players). For there to be 8 ones, the other three players would need to have 8 ones among their 24 digits, which is about 1/3 of their digits. This is possible but getting somewhat high. Based on previous rounds, Player 1 seemed confident about 9s (bidding 6 9s), and Player 3 raised to 7 9s. I could bid 8 2s, 8 3s, etc., or increase the quantity. Since I have three 5s and two 8s in my hand, I'm more confident about these digits. I'll bid 8 5s, which is higher than 8 1s and leverages my knowledge of my own hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 8 5s and considering my hand 99792581, which contains one 5, I must assess the likelihood of there being at least 8 fives among all players. Since each player has 8 digits and there are 4 active players, the total number of digits is 32. My hand contributes 1 five. To reach 8 fives, the other 3 players must collectively have 7 fives. This seems plausible but on the higher end, given the distribution of digits. However, considering the bidding history and the fact that players have been bidding relatively high, it suggests that players might have a good number of the digits they're bidding on. Given that I don't have enough information to confidently challenge and the bid of 8 5s is already high, making a higher bid would require either bidding a higher quantity of the same digit, which is risky given the total number of digits, or bidding the same quantity of a higher digit. Since 5 is a relatively low digit and we've already had high bids on 9s and 5s, I should consider the possibility of bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity or slightly higher if I had a strong hand in that digit. However, my hand does not strongly support bidding on any digit higher than 5 without more information. Given these considerations and the need to make a strictly higher bid, challenging seems like a viable option if I believe 8 fives are unlikely. Yet, the history shows that challenges on high bids have resulted in the bidder winning, indicating that players might have a good grasp of the digit distribution. My hand does not provide a clear advantage for a higher bid on any specific digit, and given the risk of elimination, I must weigh the odds carefully.

Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 0s and I have 99792581 in my hand, which contains one 9 and no 0s, I must consider the likelihood of the bid being true and the potential for a higher bid. Since there are 24 total digits remaining and only 3 players, including myself, the maximum number of any digit one player can have is 8. The bid of 4 0s seems plausible but not extremely high given the total number of digits. However, considering my hand and the need to make a strictly higher bid, I must decide whether to challenge or increase the bid. Increasing the quantity of 0s might be risky without knowing the other players' hands, but I can consider bidding on a higher digit if I have enough of it in my hand. Since I have a 9, which is a high digit, and considering the previous bids and challenges, bidding on 9s could be strategic. The last bid on 9s was 3 9s by Player 3, which suggests there might be a considerable number of 9s. Given my hand has one 9 and aiming to make a higher bid than 4 0s, bidding on 9s seems like a reasonable strategy.

Player 1 Reasoning: Given that there are only 16 total digits remaining and I have 8 of them, I can make an educated guess about the distribution. My hand contains 99792581, which has two 9s, one 7, one 5, one 2, one 8, and one 1. Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Considering the limited number of digits left and the fact that I have two 9s, bidding on 9s seems like a reasonable starting point. However, I should also consider the possibility of bidding on other digits that I have in my hand, like 7, 5, 2, 8, or 1, to potentially get a higher quantity or a safer bet. Given that I have two 9s and they are the highest digit, starting with a bid of 2 9s could be a good strategy, as it's low enough to be potentially true but also takes into account my own hand's composition.

Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 9s' and my hand '99792581', I have three 9s. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and there are only 16 total digits remaining, it's possible that the total count of 9s could be high. However, with only two players left and each having 8 digits, the highest possible total for any digit is 16. The bid '3 9s' seems reasonable but could be challenged if the actual count is lower. Considering my hand and the fact that I need to bid higher, I could increase the quantity or the digit. Given that I have a significant number of 9s, increasing the quantity of 9s seems like a viable option. But, considering the game's progression and the elimination of other players, it's also crucial to consider the likelihood of the bid being true. Since I have three 9s and the bid is '3 9s', it's likely that Player 3 also has at least one 9, making the bid plausible. Therefore, I should consider making a higher bid rather than challenging, as challenging could lead to my elimination if the bid is true.

Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 9s and my hand containing two 9s, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least 5 nines in total between Player 1 and Player 3. Since each player has 8 digits, the maximum number of 9s one player could have is 8, but given that I have 2 nines, it's possible for Player 3 to also have a significant number of 9s. However, with only 16 digits in total and my hand already accounting for 2 of those 9s, bidding higher on 9s seems risky. Considering the alternative, bidding on a different digit seems more plausible, but I must ensure the bid is strictly higher than 5 9s. Given that I have one 8 and one 5 in my hand, and considering the distribution of digits, it might be more strategic to challenge the current bid, as the probability of having exactly or more than 5 nines might be lower than anticipated, especially since the game has progressed and digits have been revealed through previous challenges.
