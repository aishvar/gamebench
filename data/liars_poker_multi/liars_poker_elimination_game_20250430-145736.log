Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 27294586, which gives me two 2s, one 7, one 9, one 4, one 5, one 8, and one 6. Starting with a conservative bid based on my hand, I will bid on the digit I have the most of, which is 2. Bidding 3 2s is a reasonable starting point, as I already have two, and it's likely at least one other player has a 2 among the remaining 40 digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have one 0 and one 8 in my visible digits (59703801), but no 2s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll make a conservative bid by increasing the digit. Bidding 3 3s is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my eight-digit hand. To satisfy the current bid of 3 3s only one more 3 needs to be among the 40 unknown digits, which is very likely. Raising the quantity leverages my pair of 3s while still keeping the probability of success high: the chance there are at least two more 3s in 40 random digits is roughly 92%. Therefore bidding 4 3s is a safe and legal way to top the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (50127753), I have zero 3s. Player 2 has bid 4 3s, which means they believe there are at least 4 threes among all players' hands. Since I have none, all 4 would need to be distributed among the other 5 players. This is certainly possible - each player has 8 digits, so the other 5 players have 40 digits total. The probability of finding at least 4 threes among 40 random digits is quite high. I could challenge, but it's risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have two 5s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 5s. I'll bid 4 5s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains a 6, and the current bid is 4 5s. Bidding 4 6s is a valid higher bid since it maintains the same quantity (4) but increases the digit (6 > 5). This leverages my hand's 6 while adhering to the rules.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. In my hand (68251103), I have one 6. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits in play. Statistically, each digit should appear about 4.8 times. Since I only have one 6, unless someone is holding a lot of 6s, 4 is a reasonable but not excessive bid. However, there is no strong reason to challenge yet, as it's plausible. To continue, I can safely raise the bid by increasing the digit to 7, as I have one 7 in my hand, making '4 7s' a valid next bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 27294586, which contains one 7. The current bid is 4 7s by Player 5. With 48 total digits across 6 players, it's plausible that there are at least 4 7s in play, especially since I have one. I don't have strong evidence to challenge this bid as it seems reasonable. Instead, I will make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 4 7s, I can increase the digit to 8 while keeping the quantity at 4. I have one 8 in my hand, so bidding 4 8s feels like a safe incremental increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have the digits 59703801, which means I have one 8. The total count of 8s across all players must be at least 1 (mine) plus the count from the other 5 players. Given that there are 40 digits from other players, it's plausible that there are at least 3 more 8s (since 8 is not a common digit in my hand and the previous bids were incrementing the digit). However, bidding higher quantity might be risky. I can bid 4 9s, increasing the digit, which is a safer move given my hand and the history of bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I can’t raise the digit any higher, so I need to increase the quantity to at least 5. I have two 7s in my hand. With 40 unknown digits still out there, the expected number of 7s among them is about 4, and the probability that there are at least three more (to reach a total of five) is roughly 77%. That’s a comfortable margin if I’m challenged. Therefore, bidding 5 7s both legally outbids 4 9s and leans on a digit I already hold multiples of.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 5 7s, meaning Player 2 believes there are at least 5 sevens among all players. Since I already have 2 of them, there would need to be only 3 more among the other 5 players, which is quite reasonable (less than 1 per player on average). I could bid 5 8s, but I don't have any 8s in my hand. I could bid 5 9s, but I don't have any 9s either. I could also bid 6 0s, 6 1s, 6 2s, 6 3s, 6 5s, or 6 7s. Since I have two 7s and one 5, bidding 6 7s seems risky. I'll go with 6 5s since I have one 5 in my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I have a 6 in my hand, and bidding 6 6s is a valid higher bid since the digit is higher. This maintains the pressure and leverages my own digits without challenging the current bid, which might still be plausible.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. In my hand (68251103), I have one 6. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits in play. Statistically, the expected number of any digit is about 4.8. A bid of 6 for a single digit is aggressive but not impossible. Since I only have one 6, unless someone is holding an unusually high number of 6s, this bid is risky for Player 4. Given the unlikely high count required and that the bid already exceeds the expected average, I will challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: As the starting player this round, I need to make the opening bid. My hand contains: 6, 8, 2, 5, 1, 1, 0, 3. The most frequent digits are 1 (appearing twice), and all other digits appear once. Since this is the first bid, I want to choose a digit I have at least one of, and make a conservative opening bid to avoid overcommitting. I'll start with '2 1s' since I have two 1s, making it a safe and reasonable opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s by Player 5, which is a very low bid. I have no 1s in my hand (27294586), but with 5 players and 40 total digits, it's still plausible that there are at least 2 1s across all hands. Challenging such a low bid is risky because it's likely to be true. Instead, I can safely make a higher bid. Since I have two 2s in my hand, bidding 3 2s feels reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 2 1s. This keeps the bid conservative while staying in the game.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. My hand is 59703801, which contains one 2 and no other relevant information for the current bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have one 2, it's possible there are at least 3 2s in total among all players. However, I can bid higher by increasing the digit. I will bid 3 3s, as it's a valid higher bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 4s. To beat the current bid of 3 3s I can keep the quantity at 3 and raise the digit. With my two 4s, only one more 4 is needed among the 32 unknown digits, which is highly likely. This is a minimal, low-risk increase that keeps pressure on the next player.

Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (50127753), I have zero 4s. The current bid is 3 4s, which means Player 2 is claiming there are at least 3 fours among all players. Since I have none, those 3+ fours would need to be distributed among the other 4 players. This is certainly possible, as each player has 8 digits, so there could easily be 3 or more fours total. Given that I have two 5s and three 7s in my hand, I could confidently bid either 3 5s (same quantity but higher digit) or 4 7s (higher quantity and a digit I have multiple of). Since 3 5s is only marginally better than the current bid, I'll go with 4 7s to make a stronger move based on my hand strength.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. In my hand (68251103), I have one 7. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits total. Statistically, there should be about 4 of each digit, so 4 7s is plausible. However, since I only have one 7, unless someone has a hand loaded with 7s, the bid is not obviously bluffing. Making a minimal higher bid is safest. I have two 8s, so bidding 4 8s is reasonable, as it's only a slight increase and keeps pressure on others.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 5. In my hand, I have two 8s out of my 8 digits. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average number of any digit across all hands would be around 4. Since I already have 2 8s, it’s plausible that there are at least 2 more 8s among the other 32 digits, making the total of 4 8s possible. However, I need to make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity to 5 or more of a digit or bid 4 of a higher digit like 9. Given that I have no 9s in my hand, bidding on 9s feels riskier. I also have two 2s, and the digit 2 has been bid on earlier, so there might be some concentration there. However, to make a safer bid, I’ll increase the quantity to 5 8s, as I already contribute 2 to the count, and it’s not an extreme jump from 4. This keeps the bid plausible while pushing the risk onto the next player. I’m avoiding a challenge because 4 8s doesn’t seem outrageously high with 40 digits in play.

Given that there are 40 total digits and the current bid is 5 8s, it's plausible that there are at least 5 eights. However, increasing the quantity to 6 might be too high unless I have a strong reason to believe others have many 8s. I can see that my hand contains a variety of digits, and I have one 8. Bidding 5 9s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit, making it a higher bid. This is based on the fact that I have zero 9s, but it's a strategic move to test others or bluff.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I hold 0 nines. That means all five nines must come from the other 32 unseen digits. With a 10% chance per digit, the expected number of nines in those 32 digits is only 3.2; the probability of there being 5 or more is roughly 20%. Any higher bid would have to be at least 6 of some digit, and with my best digits (two 3s, two 4s, two 7s) the success chance would still be under 50% if challenged. Challenging a bid that is likely false gives me a far better chance to stay in the game than making a shaky higher bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I’m the first bidder of the round, so I must open with a bid. My hand contains two 7s (7,7). Out of the remaining 24 unseen digits, the chance that there is at least one additional 7 is very high (over 90%), making a total of three 7s quite likely. Opening with 3 7s is therefore safe while still being a meaningful starting bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (50127753), I have two 7s. The current bid is 3 7s, meaning Player 2 believes there are at least 3 sevens among all players. Since I already have 2 of them, this bid seems quite reasonable - we only need 1 more seven among the other 3 players to make this bid valid. I could challenge, but it's very likely the bid is accurate. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I could bid 3 8s (same quantity, higher digit) or 4 7s (higher quantity, same digit). Since I don't have any 8s in my hand, but do have two 7s, bidding 4 7s seems more reasonable as I'm already contributing half of that quantity. I also have three 5s in my hand, so I could confidently bid 4 5s or even 5 5s, but those are lower than the current bid of 3 7s.

Making a higher bid is risky without any 7s in my hand, but challenging at this stage is also risky as 4 is not an extreme quantity. To stay in the game, I will make a minimal higher bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 27294586, which contains one 8. The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 5. With 32 total digits across 4 players, it's possible but not highly likely that there are 4 or more 8s in total, as I only contribute one. However, challenging carries a risk since I don't know the other players' hands, and 4 8s is still within a reasonable range (about 12.5% of total digits if evenly distributed). I could bid higher, such as 5 8s or 4 9s. Bidding 5 8s might be too aggressive given I only have one 8, and it could invite a challenge. Bidding 4 9s is safer as it shifts to a different digit with the same quantity. Since I have no 9s, it’s a bluff, but it’s a small increase and might be believable. I’ll go with 4 9s to keep the bidding conservative and avoid an immediate challenge.

Randomly, the chance of seeing at least four 9s in 24 digits is only about 20%. Player 0 simply raised the digit from 8 to 9 without increasing quantity, a move often made when a player has only a couple of that digit and hopes the table folds.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 68251103, which contains zero 7s. The current bid is 4 7s, meaning that across all 24 digits, at least four 7s must exist. Since I have none, the remaining two players would need to have all four 7s between them, which is possible but not highly likely, especially given the distribution of digits. Given the recent history, challenges on mid-range bids have succeeded when the bid was a stretch. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding in this final round against Player 2. Looking at my hand (50127753), I have two 7s and two 5s, which are my most frequent digits. Since I'm making the first bid, I want to start conservatively but with a digit I have multiple of. Starting with '2 7s' is reasonable - I know I have two 7s in my hand, so even if Player 2 has none, my bid would be accurate. This gives me room to maneuver in future rounds while establishing a baseline with a digit I'm confident about.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid of 2 7s is already met by the two 7s in my own hand, so challenging would certainly eliminate me. To keep the pressure on a digit I’m strong in, I’ll increase the quantity to 3 while staying with 7s. Since the opponent chose to open on 7s, it’s very plausible they hold at least one 7 themselves, making 3 7s a solid, defensible step up.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have 2 sevens in my hand (50127753). Player 2 has bid 3 7s, which means they're claiming there are at least 3 sevens total between our hands. Since I have 2 sevens, their bid would require them to have at least 1 seven in their hand. This is certainly possible, so challenging would be risky. I should make a higher bid. I could bid 4 7s, but that would be risky since I only know about my 2 sevens. I could bid 3 8s (same quantity, higher digit) but I have no 8s. I could bid 3 9s, but again I have no 9s. The safest option is to bid 4 0s, 4 1s, 4 2s, 4 5s, or 4 something else I have in my hand. I have one 0, one 1, one 2, and one 5 in my hand, so any of these would be reasonable. I'll go with 4 5s since 5 is a higher digit than 0, 1, or 2, making it harder for my opponent to continue bidding up within the same quantity.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have 0 fives in my hand. For the bid of 4 5s to be correct, Player 3 would need to have all 4 (or more) fives in their 8-digit hand. The probability of any one hand containing 4 or more of a specific digit is well under 1%, making the bid overwhelmingly unlikely to be true. Challenging gives me an excellent chance to win the round.
