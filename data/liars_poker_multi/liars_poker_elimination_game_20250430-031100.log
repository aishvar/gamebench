Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in a new round. My hand is 74845089, which contains two 4s and two 8s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, a bid of '3 4s' is a conservative and plausible starting bid based on my hand and the average distribution of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It is the start of the round and I am the first bidder. My hand contains two 4s and two 8s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, bidding '3 4s' is a reasonable and conservative opening bid based on the digits I have multiple of. I only need one more 4 among the other 32 digits held by the other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the situation carefully. In my hand, I have one 4 (42930279). Player 0 has bid 3 4s total across all players. In the previous round, when there were 6 players (48 total digits), the actual count of 4s was 6. Now we have 5 players with 40 total digits. Since I have 1 four in my hand, there need to be at least 2 more 4s among the other players for the bid to be valid. Given that we saw 6 fours in the previous round with 6 players, it's quite likely that there are at least 3 fours total. I could challenge, but it seems risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 7s. I'll bid 3 7s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s made by Player 2. I have 8 secret digits in my hand: 27848561. I can see that I have two 7s in my hand. With 5 active players and 8 digits each, there are a total of 40 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Given that I have two 7s and there are 3 other players (excluding Player 2 who made the bid), it's possible that there are enough 7s to make the bid of 3 7s valid. However, I don't have enough information to be certain. I will bid higher than 3 7s by increasing the quantity since I have a relatively high number of digits that could contribute to a higher bid. I will bid 4 7s as it seems like a reasonable next step given my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s by Player 3. I have two 7s in my hand, so I can confidently bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Bidding 5 7s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. To bid, I need to bid higher. I can bid 6 0s, which is a safe bet as it is higher than 5 7s and I have a 0 in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:0 - openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s by Player 5. I have 1 zero in my hand. There are 4 other players with a total of 32 digits. For the bid of 6 0s to be true, there must be at least 5 more zeros among the other 32 digits. Assuming a uniform distribution of digits, the expected number of zeros among 32 digits is 3.2. The probability of having 5 or more zeros among 32 digits is relatively low (approximately 18% based on a binomial distribution calculation). This means there is a high probability (approximately 82%) that the total count of zeros is less than 6. Therefore, challenging the bid of 6 0s is the statistically favorable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It is the start of the round, and the current bid is None. I must make the first bid. My hand contains two 4s. A bid of 3 4s is a conservative and reasonable starting bid, supported by my hand and consistent with previous rounds where this bid proved successful.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (42930279), I have 0 fours. Player 0 has bid 3 4s, which means they're claiming there are at least 3 fours among all players. In the previous round, when Player 0 bid 3 4s, it was challenged and there were actually 6 fours total. However, that was with 5 players (40 total digits). Now we have 4 players (32 total digits), so there are fewer digits overall. Given that I have 0 fours in my hand, and Player 0 has shown consistency in bidding 3 4s, it's reasonable to assume there are at least 3 fours. I could safely bid 3 5s, increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity. I could also bid 4 0s since I have two 0s in my hand, which would increase the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 2. I have 8 digits in my hand: 27848561. I see that I have two 6s and one 5. Given that the total number of digits across all players is 32 and there are 4 active players, I should consider the possibility of higher bids or challenging. Since my hand contains a 5, and I know there are at least 3 5s, bidding higher seems reasonable. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 3. I have two 6s in my hand, which is a good indication that the bid is likely true. However, I can try to bid higher on the same digit to increase my chances of winning. Bidding 5 6s seems like a reasonable move.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:0 - openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s, made by Player 4. While the expected number of 6s across 32 digits is 3.2, the bid has been raised by two players (Player 3 and Player 4), which could indicate they hold several 6s. Challenging carries the risk of immediate elimination if the bid is true. My hand contains two 8s. The expected number of 8s across 32 digits is also 3.2. Bidding 5 8s is a valid higher bid than 5 6s. Having two 8s in my hand makes a total count of 5 or more 8s across all hands reasonably plausible (approximately 44% chance). This bid is less risky than challenging and keeps me in the game, putting pressure on the next player.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:3 - claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (42930279), I have one 9, two 2s, one 4, one 3, one 7, and two 0s, but no 8s. The current bid is 5 8s from Player 0. With 32 total digits in play and my hand having 0 eights, there would need to be 5 eights among the other 24 digits (about 21% of remaining digits). While not impossible, this seems somewhat high given that each digit has roughly a 10% chance of appearing. Player 0 has made two consecutive bids (5 6s and 5 8s), which might indicate they're bluffing. I'll challenge this bid since I have no 8s in my hand and the probability seems unfavorable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round, so I must make a bid. My hand contains two 4s and two 8s, which are my most frequent digits. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the average count for any digit is 2.4. Bidding 3 of a digit I hold multiple copies of is a standard and safe starting move. Bidding 3 4s is a reasonable choice based on my hand and aligns with my previous starting bids in this game, which have been successful.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s made by Player 0. I, Player 3, have the hand 27848561, which contains two 4s. Given that there are only 3 active players and 8 digits per player, the total possible digits are 24. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. Since I have two 4s and there could be at most 6 more 4s (from the other two players), bidding 4 4s seems reasonable and higher than the current bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have two 4s in my hand, making it likely that I can bid at least 5 4s. Given the total digits remaining (24) and my hand, bidding 5 4s seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s, with a total of 24 digits across 3 players. I have two 4s in my hand. For the bid to be true, there must be at least 5 - 2 = 3 more 4s among the remaining 16 digits held by the other two players. The expected number of 4s in 16 random digits is 16 * 0.1 = 1.6. A count of 3 or more is significantly above average. Using a binomial probability calculation (n=16, p=0.1), the probability of having 3 or more 4s is approximately 21.1%. This means there is about a 78.9% chance that the total count of 4s is less than 5. Challenging the bid gives me a high probability of winning.

With 16 total digits between the two players, the expected count for any digit is 1.6. Bidding 3 4s is a reasonable starting bid based on my hand, as I have 2 and am betting the opponent has at least 1 more. This is a strategy I have used successfully in previous rounds.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s made by Player 0. I am Player 3 and my hand is 27848561. I have one 4 in my hand. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, I should consider the likelihood of there being at least 3 4s in total. Since I only have one 4, and Player 0 must have at least 3 4s for their bid to be valid, I find it suspicious. However, I can also try to make a higher bid. I have a 5, 6, 7, and 8 in my hand, but no other 4s. A reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 4 5s seems reasonable as it's higher than 3 4s and I have a 5 in my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s, made by Player 3. There are 16 total digits across both hands. My hand contains one 5. For the bid to be true, Player 3 must have at least three 5s in their 8 digits. Statistically, having three or more of a specific digit in 8 digits is a low probability event. The expected count of any digit across 16 total digits is 1.6, making a bid of 4 significantly above average. Challenging this bid appears to be the most statistically favorable move.
