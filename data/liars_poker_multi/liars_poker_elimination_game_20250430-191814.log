Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand. There are 40 unknown cards and each has a 10% chance of being a 0, so I expect about 4 more 0s among them. Bidding 5 0s (needing at least 2 more) has roughly a 92% chance of being correct, making it a strong opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. Since it's early in the game and the bid is relatively low, I will make a slightly higher bid. I'll bid 6 1s, increasing the quantity and changing the digit to something I don't have.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero '1's in my hand. The other 40 digits have an expected 4 ones (binomial with p=0.1), so the chance of at least 6 is only about 20%. The bid is unlikely, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand, and with 32 unknown digits the expected count of 3s among them is about 3.2, giving an expected total of about 6.2. Bidding six 3s is reasonable as the opening bid given my hand advantage.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s, and I need to make a higher bid. I have one '3' in my hand. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 6 and increase the digit. Since 6 4s is higher than 6 3s, bidding 6 4s is a valid and reasonable move given my hand and the current bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. I have no 4s in my hand, and with 40 digits total, it's possible the actual count is less than 6. Challenging could be effective.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains three 7s. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid based on my own digits. Bidding 3 7s is a logical first move, as it reflects the count in my hand and sets a baseline for others to challenge or exceed.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains two 7s (9,8,7,2,5,7,4,3). The current bid is 3 7s. Since there are 32 digits in play and I already have two 7s, it is likely there are at least three 7s among all hands. Challenging now would be risky. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the digit or the quantity. I have one 8 and one 9, but raising to 3 8s or 3 9s is riskier since I only have one of each. Instead, I will increase the quantity of 7s to 4, which is a reasonable and safe progression given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand, so bidding 5 0s requires only two more among the 24 unknown cards (probability ~69%). This is a strong, credible increase over the current bid of 4 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand and the expected number of 0s among 32 digits is about 3.2, with only around a 10% chance of at least 5. Given my hand has zero 0s, Player 0’s bid of 5 0s seems very unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand. With 16 unknown digits across the other two players, the expected number of additional 3s is about 1.6, and the probability of seeing at least one more 3 is over 80%. Starting the bidding with 4 3s is a strong, reasonably safe opening bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains three 7s. The current bid is 4 3s. Bidding 4 7s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid and strategic move based on my hand's composition.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 98725743, which contains two 7s. The current bid is 4 7s. With 24 total digits and only 8 of them in my hand, it's possible but not guaranteed that there are at least 4 sevens among all hands. Since I have two 7s, there would need to be at least two more 7s among the other 16 digits. Statistically, that's plausible, but not certain. However, since the bid is not excessively high and I have a strong hand for 7s, it's risky to challenge. Instead, I should increase the bid to a higher digit at the same quantity, leveraging my 9, 8, and 7. I have one 8 and one 9, but only one of each, so the safest higher bid is 4 8s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold zero 8s. With only 16 unknown digits left and an expected ~1.6 8s among them, the chance of at least 4 8s across all hands is very low (~8%). Player 5’s bid of 4 8s is unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold three 3s in my hand, so I can safely bid 3 3s knowing at least those exist. This conservative bid sets a strong baseline and is unlikely to be challenged successfully.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains three 7s. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid than the current 3 3s because the digit is higher. This leverages my existing cards without overcommitting.
