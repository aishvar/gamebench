Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand and there are 40 unknown digits among the other players. The expected count of any given digit in those 40 is 4, so bidding 4 8s means I only need two more from them, which is very likely. This makes a solid, safe opening bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. With 5 other players, it's possible there are at least 4 8s in total, but not guaranteed. However, bidding higher is safer than challenging. I can bid 4 9s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have the hand 57033568, which contains one 9. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have some information about my own hand, I know I have one 9. There are 5 other players with 8 digits each, so there are 40 digits I don't know about. It's possible that there are at least 3 more 9s among the other players, making a total of 4 9s plausible. However, bidding more than 4 seems risky. I can bid 4 0s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have the digits 57033568, which means I have one 5 and no 9s. The total count of 9s across all players is at least 4 to satisfy the current bid. Given that there are 6 players and each has 8 digits, the probability of having at least 4 nines is plausible but not certain. However, increasing the quantity or digit is required for a new bid. I can see that I have a 5 and there are 5 other players. It's possible that the count of 5s is higher than 9s. I will bid 4 5s, increasing the digit is not possible without decreasing quantity, so I'll consider a reasonable increase in digit or quantity.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:4 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 53868293, which contains one 5. The current bid is 5 5s by Player 2. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average number of any digit across all hands is about 4.8, so 5 5s is slightly above average but plausible. However, since I only have one 5, it means the other 5 players must collectively have at least 4 more 5s, which is possible (e.g., one player could have multiple 5s). I’m not confident enough to challenge yet, as the bid isn’t outrageously high. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding 5 8s feels safer since I contribute to the count and it’s a reasonable increase from the current bid of 5 5s (same quantity, higher digit).

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 6 0s is a safe increase in quantity, and the digit 0 is less likely to be overbid quickly.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. My hand contains two 0s, so at least four other 0s must exist in the remaining 40 digits for the bid to be true. The expected number of 0s across all hands is 4.8, making 6 0s statistically unlikely. Challenging this bid offers a reasonable chance of success if the bid is false, while bidding higher (e.g., 6 1s or 7 0s) introduces similar or greater risk without stronger evidence from my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make a reasonable opening bid. My hand contains two 9s, so bidding 3 9s is plausible. This bid is low enough to be likely true but gives room for others to raise. Starting with a digit I have increases my confidence in the bid's validity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid of 3 9s is plausible (I have zero 9s and the other 32 cards likely contain about 3.2 nines on average), so a challenge is risky. I hold two 8s and need only two more among the other 32 cards to make 4 8s, which has over an 80% chance. Bidding 4 8s also forces opponents to raise quantity rather than just the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which seems plausible given that there are 40 digits in play and 5 players. However, I have a 9 in my hand, and the previous bid was 3 9s. Bidding 4 9s would be a safe increase, as it maintains the quantity but increases the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have 57033568, which contains one 5 and no 9s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I don't have any 9s, bidding 5 9s might be too high unless others have many. However, I can bid on a higher digit. Bidding 4 0s is a valid move as it's a higher digit than 9 (wrapping around is not considered, so this isn't an option), but actually, I can consider bidding on a higher quantity or the same quantity with a different strategy. Noting my hand doesn't have a 9, I should be cautious. Bidding 5 0s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity and changes the digit to a lower one, which isn't valid. A valid move is to increase the quantity to 5 9s or keep the quantity and bid on a 'higher' digit isn't possible since 9 is the highest. So, I will increase the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:4 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 53868293, which contains no 9s. The current bid is 5 9s by Player 2. With 40 total digits across 5 players, an average of 4 of each digit is expected if evenly distributed. However, since I have zero 9s in my 8 digits, the likelihood of there being at least 5 9s in the remaining 32 digits is reduced. It would require the other players to have an unusually high concentration of 9s. Bidding higher, such as 6 0s, feels risky without strong support in my hand for any digit (my highest count is two 3s and two 8s). Given the low probability of 5 9s based on my hand, challenging seems like the better option rather than escalating the bid further.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 53868293, which gives me two 3s, two 8s, and one each of 5, 6, 2, and 9. With 32 total digits across 4 players, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 4 8s seems reasonable as I have two 8s myself, and it's likely that among the other 24 digits, there are at least two more 8s. This bid sets a moderate starting point and allows room for others to bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Given my two 9s and 24 digits in other players' hands, it's plausible there are at least four 9s total. Challenging 4 8s is riskier since my single 8 plus reasonable distribution in others' hands could meet the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand. With 24 unknown digits among the other three players and an expected 2.4 9s, the probability of at least four 9s is low (around 23%). It’s unlikely the bid holds, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 3 9s is reasonable, as it accounts for my own digits and assumes at least one additional 9 exists in the other players' hands. This bid is conservative and likely true, setting a foundation for further bidding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand (from 94716542). The current bid is 3 9s, which means there would need to be at least two more 9s among the other two players' hands (Player 3 and Player 5). Given that the previous round's challenge on 4 9s was successful (actual count was 4), it's plausible that there are still a few 9s in play. However, bidding higher would require either increasing the quantity (which might be risky) or the digit. Since I don't have strong evidence of higher digits in my hand, I'll challenge the current bid as it seems borderline given the history.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable starting point, as it requires only one additional 9 in Player 3's hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 53868293, which contains two 3s, two 8s, one 5, one 6, one 2, and one 9. The current bid by Player 5 is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, so there could be up to two more 9s in Player 5's hand, making the total of 3 9s plausible. However, since it's early in this round with only two players left and a total of 16 digits, I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Given that 3 9s is a reasonable bid and I have one 9 myself, challenging might be risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid to push the game forward. I'll bid 4 8s since I have two 8s in my hand, which supports a higher quantity bid, and it increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 3 9s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s. Bidding 4 9s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 53868293, which contains two 8s and one 9. The current bid by Player 5 is 4 9s, meaning there should be at least four 9s across both hands (16 total digits). Since I only have one 9, Player 5 would need to have at least three 9s in their 8-digit hand for the bid to hold, which is possible but not highly likely (probability of 3 or more 9s in 8 digits is relatively low). However, with only two players left, I need to be cautious about challenging, as a wrong challenge eliminates me. Looking at my hand, I have strong counts for 3s and 8s (two each). I can make a safer bid of 5 0s or higher to shift the risk to Player 5. Given the history of bids on 9s (multiple bids of 3 and 4), it's plausible there are a few 9s in play, so I’ll avoid challenging and instead bid higher. I’ll bid 5 0s to increase the quantity and test Player 5's response.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s by Player 3. My hand contains two 0s, so Player 3 would need at least three 0s to meet the bid. Given the maximum possible digits and no evidence of Player 3 having many 0s, challenging is a calculated risk. If the actual count is less than 5 (e.g., 4), the bid fails and Player 3 is eliminated.
