Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 5s and two 6s. Bidding 3 5s is reasonable since it's a slight increase from my own count and there are 5 other players who might contribute additional 5s. This bid is low enough to likely be true but allows room for higher bids later.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (99617037), I have zero 5s. Player 0 has bid 3 5s, which means they believe there are at least 3 fives among all players. Since I don't have any 5s, all 3+ would need to be in the other players' hands. With 5 other players having 8 digits each (40 digits total), it's certainly possible there are 3 or more 5s. I could challenge, but it's a risky move this early in the game with such a low bid. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 9s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 9s. I could bid 3 9s (same quantity, higher digit) or 4 lower digits. Since I know I have two 9s already, I'll go with 3 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand contains the digits 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 4, 0. Counting the 9s, I have only one 9. Given the total of 48 digits, itâ€™s highly unlikely that there are at least 4 nines in total. Challenging now is a safe bet to potentially eliminate Player 1 if the count of 9s is less than 3, which is very probable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I'm starting this round, so I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (99617037), I have two 9s, one 6, one 1, one 7, one 0, and one 3. Since I have two 9s in my hand, there are likely more 9s among the other players. With 5 players each having 8 digits, there are 40 total digits. A conservative estimate would be to bid 3 9s, which I'm confident exists since I already have 2 myself. This was a winning bid in the previous round too, which suggests it's a reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand. The previous round revealed there were 5 9s with 48 total digits. Now with 40 digits (Player 2 eliminated), there should still be at least 4 9s remaining. Since Player 1 only bid 3 9s (which is conservative given the known information), this bid is likely safe. I should make a higher bid. Given I have two 7s in my hand, bidding 4 7s seems reasonable - it increases the quantity while choosing a digit I partially know about.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 7s and my hand containing 26645295, I notice I have no 7s but do have repeated digits. Considering the total digits remaining is 40 and we have 5 players, the average distribution per digit is roughly 8 occurrences across all players. Since I have no 7s, I must consider the likelihood of other players having enough 7s to meet or exceed the bid of 4 7s. Given that the previous bid was 3 9s and was not challenged, it suggests players might have a diverse set of digits. However, without direct evidence or a strong indication that the bid of 4 7s is unlikely, making a higher bid seems more strategic. I could bid on a digit I have in abundance or try to increase the quantity, considering the constraints. Since I have two 6s and the current bid is on 7s, bidding on 6s with a higher quantity than any previous bid on 6s seems reasonable, but given the current bid is 4 7s, the safest increase is to bid on a higher digit or the same digit with a higher quantity. Given my hand and the goal to make a strictly higher bid, I must decide between increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have enough information to safely challenge and given the constraints, increasing the digit seems less risky than increasing the quantity significantly.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 8s in my hand (from 27849060), so I know at least 2 8s exist. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since there are 40 total digits and 4 players left besides me, it's possible others have 8s. I will increase the quantity to make a higher bid. Bidding 5 8s seems reasonable as it is a slight increase and still plausible given the total count of digits.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:5 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. With 4 other players, there are 32 remaining digits. The bid of 5 8s implies 4 more 8s in others' hands, which is plausible. Bidding 6 8s increases the quantity while maintaining the same digit, leveraging my existing 8 and pressuring others to either challenge or adjust. This balances risk and strategy without assuming unknown 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand (99617037). The current bid is 6 8s made by Player 0. With 5 active players each having 8 digits, there are 40 total digits in play. For the bid to be valid, at least 6 of those 40 digits need to be 8s. Since I have no 8s, all 6 would need to come from the other 4 players' hands (32 digits total). While possible, this seems somewhat unlikely. However, I don't have strong evidence to challenge yet. I could bid 7 8s, but that would be risky given I have none. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, which gives me confidence to bid 6 9s - same quantity but higher digit than the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid of 6 9s is very suspicious. In my hand, I have zero 9s. From the previous round, we know there were 5 9s total with 6 players (48 digits). Now with 5 players (40 digits), it's unlikely the count of 9s increased. Since Player 1 made both the winning bid of 3 9s earlier and is now claiming 6 9s, this seems like a bluff. Given I have zero 9s and the previous information, I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 5 and one 8 in my hand. Since I'm starting the round and there are 32 total digits (8 per player, 4 players), a conservative opening bid is reasonable. Based on the previous rounds, players seem to favor higher digits. Starting with 3 8s is strategic since I have one 8 and it's a high digit that others might be hesitant to challenge early.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 8s and my hand containing no 8s, I must consider the likelihood of this bid being true. With 32 total digits remaining and 4 players, the maximum number of 8s any player could have is 8 (if they had all 8s), but this is highly unlikely. Since I don't have any 8s, I have to rely on the probability that the other players might have 8s. However, given that the previous round had a bid of 6 8s which was followed by a bid of 6 9s and then a challenge that revealed only 4 9s, it suggests that high bids on specific digits might be risky. Considering my own hand has a couple of repeated digits (two 6s and two 5s, and two 9s and two 2s), it's possible that other players might also have repeated digits, but without more information, it's hard to accurately assess the likelihood of 3 8s. Given the total number of digits and the fact that I don't have any 8s, challenging seems like a reasonable option, especially since the bid is not extremely high and the total number of digits is limited, making very high counts of any single digit less likely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand of 58117480, I have one 8, one 7, one 5, one 4, one 1 (twice), and one 0. Since I'm starting the round with 3 players (24 total digits), and I have proven successful with 8s before, I can start with a conservative bid of 3 8s. I know I have one 8, so I only need two more 8s between the other two players, which is reasonable given previous rounds showed multiple 8s existed.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have the digits 27849060, which means I have one 8. With 24 total digits remaining and one 8 in my hand, it's plausible that there are at least 3 8s in total. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have information about the other players' hands, I'll consider my own hand and the current bid. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit. However, I should also consider the likelihood of there being more 8s or 9s. Given that I have one 8 and no 9s, and there are 16 digits in the other players' hands, it's possible they have more 8s or 9s. I will bid 4 8s to increase the quantity, as it seems more likely to be true given the previous round's outcome where the count of 8s was 4 out of 32 total digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 5. I have one 8 in my hand (51866542). The total digits remaining are 24, so the maximum possible 8s across all players is 3 (since there are 3 players). Since I hold one 8, the remaining two players would need to have at least three 8s to meet the bid. This is statistically unlikely given the small pool of digits. Challenging is the optimal move to test the validity of the bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. I have the digits 27849060, which means I have 2 eights and other scattered digits. With 16 total digits remaining between Player 3 and me, a reasonable starting bid could be based on my count and a guess about Player 3's hand. I see I have one 7, so bidding on 7s could be a good start as there's a chance Player 3 might also have a 7. I will bid 3 7s as it's a moderate start.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand of 58117480. With only 2 players remaining and 16 total digits, Player 5 would need at least 2 more 7s in their hand to make their bid of 3 7s valid. While possible, this means they would need 25% of their digits to be 7s. Given that I can see my own hand has only one 7, and I know the distribution should be roughly random, this bid seems unlikely to be true. A challenge here is the safer play than trying to bid higher.
