Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make a reasonable opening bid. My hand contains four 4s. Bidding 5 4s is a safe starting point since it's just one more than my own count and aligns with the expected average distribution of digits (4.8 per digit across 48 total). This bid is conservative yet gives room for others to raise if they have more.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 4s in my hand. With 6 players each having 8 digits, there are 48 total digits. For the bid of '5 4s' to be valid, there need to be at least 5 fours among all players. Since I don't have any 4s, all 5 or more would have to be in the other players' hands. This is certainly possible, as the other 5 players have 40 digits total. Given this is the first bid of the game and it's relatively conservative (only claiming about 10% of all digits are 4s), I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. I'll bid '5 5s', keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit. This is a safe move since I have one 5 in my hand, so I only need 4 more 5s among the other 40 digits from other players, which is reasonable.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand. To outbid 5 5s I need a higher quantity, so bidding 6 3s leverages my strong holding. With 40 unknown digits and p=0.1, there’s roughly a 78% chance of at least three more 3s, making this bid plausible.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. I have no 3s in my hand (56651698). With 48 digits in play, the expected number of 3s is about 4.8, so 6 is a slightly aggressive bid but not unreasonable. Since I have 3 fives in my hand, I can safely raise to 6 5s, which is a higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I have the digits 5, 8, 7, 5, 0, 4, 7, 1 in my hand. Counting the 5s, I see two 5s. Since the bid is 6 5s, and I only have 2 in my hand, it's highly unlikely that the total across all players meets or exceeds 6. Challenging this bid is a good move because the actual count of 5s is probably less than 6, making the previous bid a bluff.

Player 3 Reasoning: As the starting bidder for this round, I can choose any reasonable opening bid. My hand contains three 5s (5, 5, 5), which is strong for that digit. With 40 total digits among 5 players, it's statistically likely that there are at least 5 or 6 of any digit, but bidding more than that early is risky. Given my strong holding in 5s and the previous round's tension around 5s, I'll open with a conservative but credible bid of 5 5s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. My hand contains two 1s and two 4s, but no 5s. Given the previous round's outcome where 6 5s was true, challenging 5 5s seems risky as there are likely several 5s among other players. Bidding higher is the safer option. Bidding 6 1s is a valid higher bid (increase in quantity) and is supported by having two 1s in my hand, making it a plausible quantity to reach among 5 players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. My hand contains four 4s, so bidding 6 4s (same quantity but higher digit) is a valid and defensible move. Since I have four 4s, even if other players have only two 4s combined, the bid is likely true. Challenging the 6 1s bid is riskier, as there's a plausible chance the total 1s could be 6 (e.g., one in my hand plus five in others). Bidding 6 4s leverages my strong holdings in 4s while maintaining a believable claim.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 6 4s among all players. In my hand, I have one 4. That means there would need to be at least 5 more 4s among the other 4 players (32 digits total). Each digit has a 1/10 probability, so we'd expect about 3.2 4s in those 32 digits. Having 5 more (beyond my one) is certainly possible but somewhat above the expected value. The previous round showed that there were 6 5s among 6 players (48 digits), which is close to the expected value of 4.8. Player 0 has maintained the same quantity (6) but changed the digit from the previous round. Given that I have only one 4 in my hand, I'll make a slightly higher bid of 7 2s, as I have two 2s in my hand which gives me more confidence in this bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I only have one 2 in my hand, so the other 32 unknown digits would need to contain at least six more 2s to make seven total. That has only about a 10% chance under a uniform distribution, making the bid unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand and expect about 2.4 more among the other 24 cards (24×0.1). That gives an expected total of about 5.4 3s. Bidding 5 3s is a reasonable first bid with over 70% chance of being correct and aligns with typical opening bids.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. With 32 digits in play, the expected count for any digit is about 3.2, so a bid of 5 3s is aggressive but not outrageous. I have three 5s and two 6s in my hand, making bids on those digits safer for me. The next legal bid can be 5 4s or 6 0s-9s. Since I have three 5s and two 6s, bidding 5 5s is stronger for me, as I hold a large portion of the 5s, and it doesn't increase the quantity yet.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. My hand contains zero 5s. With 32 total digits among 4 players, the expected number of 5s is 3.2. For the bid of 5 5s to be true, the other 3 players must have at least five 5s among their 24 digits. The probability of this happening (P(X>=5) for B(24, 0.1)) is approximately 6.5%. This low probability makes the bid highly suspect. Challenging this bid offers a high probability of winning and eliminating a player.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round with 3 players and 24 total digits. My hand is 40116948, containing two 1s and two 4s. The average count for any digit is 2.4. Bidding 4 of a digit I hold two of (either 1s or 4s) is a reasonable starting bid, requiring at least two more from the other 16 digits, which is quite plausible. Bidding 4 1s is based on my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. The remaining two players have 16 digits. The expected number of 1s in those 16 digits is 1.6. For the total to reach 4, the other players would need at least 3 additional 1s, which is improbable given the low probability of 1s in random digits.

Player 0 Reasoning: As the first to bid in the final round, I need to make a reasonable opening bid based on my hand.
