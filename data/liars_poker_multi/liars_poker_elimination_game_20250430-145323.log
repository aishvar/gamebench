Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the game and there are no previous bids, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 11624844, I notice I have two 4s and two 1s, among other digits. Since I have to make a bid that is strictly higher than 'None', I can start with a relatively safe bet. Considering the total number of digits in play is 48 and there are 6 players, bidding on a digit I have in my hand seems like a good strategy. I will bid on the digit 4 since I have two of them, hoping that other players might also have some, increasing the total count.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 4s in my hand, which means there need to be at least 4 fours among the other 40 digits in play. While this is possible, I can make a safer bid based on my hand. I see one 5 in my hand, so bidding '4 5s' is a reasonable increase - it keeps the same quantity but uses a higher digit. This is a conservative move that forces the next player to either go to 5 of something or a higher digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one '5' in my hand (digit '5' is not present, but I have digits 3,7,1,0,6). To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 but increase the digit. Since I have one '6' in my hand, bidding 4 6s is a valid and reasonable next bid, as it is strictly higher than 4 5s and supported by my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. The current bid of 4 6s requires at least four 6s in total, which seems uncertain since I have none. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and aligns with my strong 8s count, making it statistically plausible given the expected average of ~4.8 total 8s across all players.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand contains two 9s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, bidding 5 9s is a reasonable increase over the previous bid (higher quantity and digit) and is well supported by the two 9s in my hand, requiring only 3 more 9s from the other 5 players. Challenging 4 8s seems risky as 4 is close to the average expected count for any digit.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have two 9s in my hand (06243705). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Increasing the quantity to 6 9s seems reasonable because I know I have two 9s, and there are 4 other players who could potentially have 9s as well. The total count of 9s across all players could plausibly be at least 6.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 6 9s and considering the total number of digits remaining is 48, it's crucial to assess the feasibility of the bid. Since each player has 8 digits, the maximum number of any single digit across all players is 48 (if all players had the same digit, which is highly unlikely). The bid of 6 9s suggests a relatively high occurrence of the digit 9. However, without specific knowledge of other players' hands, it's a challenge to determine the exact likelihood. Given that I have two 4s and no 9s in my hand, and considering the bidding history where the quantity and digit have been progressively increased, making a higher bid requires careful consideration. Since the current bid is already at 6 9s, the next logical bid to surpass this would involve either increasing the quantity of 9s (which seems risky given the total number of digits) or moving to a higher digit, which is not possible since 9 is the highest digit. Therefore, challenging the current bid seems like a viable option, especially considering that the bid of 6 9s might be overly optimistic given the total number of digits in play and the distribution across players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 11624844, I have multiple occurrences of the digit '4' and at least one occurrence of other digits. Since the goal is to make a bid that is likely to be true but also strategic, bidding on a digit I have the most of could be advantageous. I have two '4's in my hand, but considering the total number of digits remaining is 40 and there are 5 players, bidding on a lower quantity of a higher digit might be wiser. However, with no previous bids to base my decision on in this round and considering my hand, I should start with a conservative yet strategic bid. Given the information and aiming to make a bid that is reasonable and potentially winnable, I'll consider the distribution of digits and the fact that I have a good number of '4's.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 4s in my hand (63579251). Given the previous round's aggressive bidding and challenge that eliminated Player 5, players seem to be making risky bids. With 5 players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. For there to be 4 4s, other players would need to have them all since I have none. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely. Additionally, Player 0 was correct in challenging last round, suggesting they might be playing more conservatively now. A challenge here could be profitable.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5, one 6, one 7, one 9, one 2, one 1, and one 3 in my hand. Since I'm starting the bidding in this round, I should make a conservative bid based on what I can see. Starting with 3 5s is reasonable - I can see one 5, and with 24 other digits among other players, it's likely there are at least two more 5s. This bid leaves room for others to bid higher while not being too risky.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s by Player 1. I have one 3 and one 1 but no 5s in my hand. Since the bid is low, I can safely increase the bid by raising the quantity to 4 and choosing a digit higher than 5. I will bid 4 6s, as it is the next valid higher bid and reasonable to expect at least four 6s among all players' 32 digits.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. Bidding 4 8s seems reasonable as it builds on my own digits and is a valid higher bid than 4 6s. This bid leverages my knowledge of my own hand and follows the game's progression, increasing the bid to a digit where I hold significant representation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s, made by Player 3. There are 4 players remaining with 8 digits each, totaling 32 digits. The average expected count for any digit is 3.2. A bid of 4 8s is slightly above average. My hand is 59271098, which contains one 8 and two 9s. Challenging 4 8s is risky, as I have one 8, meaning the other three players only need a total of three more 8s among their 24 digits for the bid to be true. This is plausible. Bidding higher is required if I don't challenge. The current bid is 4 8s. A valid higher bid is 4 9s. My hand has two 9s. For a bid of 4 9s to be true, the other three players need a total of at least two more 9s among their 24 digits. This is very likely, as the expected count for 9s among them is 2.4. Bidding 4 9s is a strong, well-supported move based on my hand and is a valid increase over 4 8s. It seems less risky than challenging 4 8s.

Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I only have one 9. For there to be 4 nines total, the other three players would need to have 3 more 9s between them. While possible, this seems unlikely given: 1) Players tend to bid based on what they have, 2) Player 4 jumped to 4 9s without gradual progression, 3) Previous rounds showed overconfident bids being challenged successfully. With only one 9 in my hand, and needing 3 more among just 3 players, I think challenging is the best move.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9, one 7, one 6, one 5, one 3, one 2, one 1, and one 0 in my hand. Since I'm starting the round, I should make a conservative bid based on what I can see. With one 5 in my hand and knowing that 5s have been bid successfully in previous rounds, starting with '3 5s' is a reasonable opening bid. This quantity is achievable if the other two players have just one 5 each, and it leaves room for others to bid higher.

Given there are 24 digits total among 3 players, having at least 3 fives is plausible. I can increase the bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I have four 3s, which is a relatively high count for digit 3. Bidding 4 3s increases the quantity and uses a digit I have strong presence in, making it a safer bid.

Since the current bid is 2 5s, bidding 2 6s is valid and a reasonable increase as I have one 6 in my hand (digit '6' appears once in '37101633'). This bid is safer than challenging because the quantity is low and the bid is believable given the total 16 digits.

Since there are only 16 total digits in play (8 per player), and Player 2 claims there are at least 2 6s total, but I know I have none, this means Player 2 would need to have at least 2 6s in their hand. While this is possible, I have historical evidence of Player 2 making aggressive bids. Given that I know for certain I have zero 6s, and Player 2 would need to have exactly 2 6s for their bid to be true, challenging seems like the safer option rather than escalating with a higher bid.
