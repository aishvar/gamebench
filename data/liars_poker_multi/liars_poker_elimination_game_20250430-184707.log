Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 51799051, which contains two 1s, one 5, three 9s. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but not too low. Given that there are 6 players with 8 digits each, a total of 48 digits, and my hand's composition, bidding 8 9s seems like a good starting point as it reflects a relatively high digit and a quantity that could be plausible given the number of players and my own hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand and only 40 digits remain unseen. The probability of at least 8 9s among those is very low (around 3%), making Player 0’s bid highly unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With 40 total digits, I expect about 3.2 additional 6s among the other players (for ~5.2 total). Opening with 5 6s is a moderate, credible bid that builds on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand. With 5 players remaining and 8 digits each, the average count for any digit is 4 (40 total digits / 10 digits). A bid of 5 6s is slightly above average, but not wildly so. However, since I have no 6s, it's less likely there are 5 or more 6s in total. I have one 9, one 5, one 8, one 4, one 2, one 3, one 7, and one 0. I can bid higher than 5 6s. Bidding 6 of any digit would be a significant jump. Bidding 5 of a higher digit is an option. I have a 9, so I could bid 5 9s. This is a reasonable bid, as it's only one more 9 than the average expectation, and I hold one 9. It's also a valid higher bid than 5 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s made by Player 2. My hand contains two 8s and one 9. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40 and there are 40 digits in total, bidding a higher quantity seems risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding a higher digit with the same quantity could be strategic. Since I have one 9, I can try to bid higher with the same quantity but a higher digit. Bidding 5 8s is not possible since my highest digit to contribute is 8 and I only have two 8s. Therefore, I will challenge the current bid of 5 9s because it seems unlikely that there are at least 5 9s in total, given the distribution of digits and that only one player has shown a 9 so far.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning I can make any initial bid. I have the hand '20880688'. Counting my digits, I have two 0s, one 2s, one 6s, and three 8s. Since I need to make a bid that is likely to be valid but also strategic, I should consider bidding on a digit that I know exists in my hand and has a reasonable quantity. Bidding '3 8s' seems like a good starting point because I have three 8s in my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand (78857876). Since Player 3 bid '3 8s' and I alone have 3 of them, this is definitely a safe bid to raise. Given my strong position with 8s, I'll increase to '4 8s' as it's likely there's at least one more 8 among the other three players' 24 remaining digits.

Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand of 78857876, I have three 7s and two 8s. With 24 total digits in play and being the first bidder, I can make a conservative bid based on what I know for certain. Since I have three 7s, bidding '3 7s' is completely safe as I can see them in my own hand. This leaves room for future increases while starting with a verifiable quantity.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have only one 7 in my hand. The bid of 3 7s requires at least two more among the other 16 digits, which has only about a 49% chance. It’s slightly more likely to be false, so I should challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand of 78857876, I have: three 7s, two 8s, and one each of 5 and 6. With 16 total digits in play (8 in my hand, 8 in opponent's hand), and three 7s already in my possession, bidding 4 7s would be a safe opening move. This is reasonable because I only need one more 7 from my opponent's eight digits to make this bid valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 4. I have 8 secret digits: 20880688. I count 3 sevens in my hand. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and Player 4 also has 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 16. The bid of 4 7s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. I have 3 sevens, and if Player 4 has 1 seven, that would make 4 sevens in total, which exactly matches the bid. However, I don't have information that guarantees Player 4 has 1 seven. I can try to make a bid that is higher or challenge if I think it's unlikely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand of 78857876, I have three 8s. The current bid by Player 3 is 5 8s, meaning they're claiming there are at least two more 8s in their hand (since I have three). While possible, this is a relatively high claim given we each have 8 digits. Also, Player 3 hasn't shown particular insight into 8s in previous rounds. Given I can see three 8s and they're claiming five total, I should make a higher bid. However, bidding higher than 5 8s would be very risky since I only see three. Therefore, challenging is the safer play.
