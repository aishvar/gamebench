Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one '1', one '2', one '4', one '5', one '6', and one '7' in my hand, which are all unique digits. Since no bids have been made yet, I can start with a low bid. Bidding 1 7s is reasonable because I have one 7, which supports the bid and is a moderate digit to start the bidding.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 6,8,2,8,3,5,4,7. Counting the 7s, I see only one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 1 7s, which matches my own 7. To increase the bid, I can only go higher in quantity or digit. Since I have only one 7, I cannot bid more than 1 7s. Therefore, the only option to proceed legally is to challenge the previous bid, as increasing isn't possible with my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. Since there are 40 digits total and 5 players, starting with a low bid like 1 7s is reasonable to keep the game going and not risk an early challenge. I will make the first bid with 1 7s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 0s and no 8s, so the current bid of 1 8s is certainly true. I can safely raise quantity to 2 using my two 0s. Bidding 2 0s is the lowest possible increase and forces future bids to be higher.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. In my hand (34078484), I have one 0. With 40 digits in play, the probability that there are at least two 0s is quite high, so challenging would not be wise. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and bid a higher digit. Looking at my hand, I have three 4s and two 8s. Bidding 2 4s is a safe, legal increment (same quantity, higher digit), and based on my hand, it's likely to be true.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have zero 4s in my hand. The current bid is 2 4s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4. While 2 4s is not an impossible bid, I have no information to support it, and I have digits that I can bid on more confidently. I have two 9s, two 6s, one 7, one 0, one 1, and one 5. Bidding 3 9s or 3 6s seems like a reasonable step up from 2 4s, as I have two of each. Bidding 3 9s is a higher quantity and a higher digit than 2 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid but does not strongly confirm it. Since the bid quantity is 3, and there are 40 digits total, having at least three 9s is reasonable. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit. I do not have more 9s, nor do I have many high digits. I have two 7s and one 8, but 3 7s or 3 8s is not higher than 3 9s. Therefore, I must increase the quantity to 4 with any digit from 0 to 9. I have two 4s and two 6s, so bidding 4 4s or 4 6s is plausible. I will bid 4 4s to make a valid higher bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid of 4 5s is plausibleâ€”I hold two 5s and expect about 3.2 more among the 32 unknown digits, so challenging is risky. The smallest valid raise is to 4 6s. I hold one 6 and expect about 3.2 more sixes in the unknown cards, making at least four 6s plausible. I will bid 4 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 34078484, which contains three 4s, one 3, one 0, one 7, one 8, and one 8. The current bid is 4 6s. I have no 6s, so I cannot directly support the current bid. Statistically, with 40 digits among 5 players, and each digit equally likely, the expected count for any digit is 4. The bid of 4 6s is right at the expected value, making it plausible but not obviously weak. However, since I have three 4s, I am in a strong position to increase the bid on 4s. The last bid on 4s was 4 4s (by Player 0), so the next legal bid on 4s must be 5 4s. Given my hand (three 4s) and the remaining 32 digits among four players, it is possible there are at least two more 4s. Therefore, bidding 5 4s is a reasonable and aggressive move.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s, two 6s, one 7, one 0, one 1, and one 5. The current bid is 5 4s. With 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.  A bid of 5 4s is slightly above average. I have no 4s.  Looking at my hand, I have two 9s. A bid of 6 9s would be a significant jump in quantity and digit, and while I have two 9s, it feels too risky with only 5 players. I also have two 6s. A bid of 5 6s would be a valid bid, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit. This seems more plausible than jumping to 6 of any digit. I will bid 5 6s.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I must increase the quantity or the digit if the quantity is the same. The next possible bids are either 5 7s or 6 0s or higher. Since I have one 7, bidding 5 7s seems reasonable and challenging the bid of 5 6s is premature given the bid is not excessively high for 40 total digits.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 34078484, which contains zero 0s. The current bid is 3 0s, meaning there must be at least three 0s among the 32 digits held by the four players. Since I have none, the remaining three players would need to collectively have at least three 0s. On average, each digit appears about 3.2 times in 32 digits, so 3 0s is plausible but not guaranteed. However, I can easily make a higher bid based on my hand. I have three 4s and two 8s. Therefore, I can safely bid 3 4s, matching the quantity but with a higher digit.

With 32 total digits across 4 players, the average count for any digit is 3.2.  A bid of 3 4s is plausible, but I have no 4s to support it. I have two 9s, so a bid involving 9s is possible. Bidding 3 9s is higher than 3 4s and is supported by my hand. Bidding 4 of any digit is also an option, but I don't have enough of any single digit to confidently bid 4. Bidding 3 9s seems like a safe and valid move.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand, so I cannot support a higher count of 9s. The next valid higher bid must be either 4 of any digit or 3 of a digit higher than 9, which is impossible since 9 is the highest digit. Therefore, I must bid a higher quantity with a lower digit. I have two 7s and one 6 in my hand, so bidding 4 6s is a reasonable increase from 3 9s. This bid is plausible given my hand and the total digits.

I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, or by increasing the quantity. I have two 4s, so bidding 1 8s (I also have one 8) or 1 9s is possible, but a safer and stronger bid is to go for 2 4s, since I have two 4s myself, making it likely that there are more in total among all hands.

The next valid bid must be higher than 2 9s, meaning at least 3 of any digit or 2 of a digit higher than 9 (which is not possible since digits go 0-9). Therefore, I must bid at least 3 of some digit. I have two 4s in my hand, but that is less than 3. I have one 7, one 5, one 1, one 2, one 6, and one 4. Since 3 0s is a reasonable bid and 0s are common, bidding 3 0s is a valid and plausible bid.

I can confidently bid higher than 3 4s. Bidding 3 9s is a valid increase (same quantity, higher digit) and is supported by my hand. I have already bid 3 9s and 2 9s earlier in this round, but the current bid is 3 4s, which is lower than 3 9s. I can bid 3 9s again as it's a valid increase from 3 4s.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, which is not very strong support for this bid. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can either increase the quantity to 4 or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit. Given my hand contains one 7, one 6, one 5, one 4, one 2, one 1, and one 0, the best next higher bid would be 3 0s (digit 0 is higher than 9 in the next quantity or same quantity with higher digit). But 3 0s is not higher than 3 9s because digits go from 0 to 9, so 0 is lower than 9. So I must increase quantity to 4. I have one 4 in my hand, so bidding 4 4s is reasonable and higher than 3 9s.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 34078484, which contains three 4s. The current bid is 4 4s. With only three 4s in my hand, for the bid to be true, at least one of the other two players must have at least one 4 between their combined 16 digits. While this is possible, it is not guaranteed. However, 4 4s is not an outlandish bid at this stage. If I challenge and there are 4 or more 4s, I am eliminated. Alternatively, I can make a safe higher bid. Since I have three 4s, bidding 4 8s is risky (I have two 8s), but bidding 4 7s is even riskier (I have one 7). The safest higher bid is to increase the quantity. Therefore, I will bid 5 4s, since I have three myself and it is plausible that there are two more among the remaining 16 digits.

A bid of 5 4s is significantly higher than average and I have none.  While it's possible other players have many 4s, the probability of there being at least five 4s out of 16 unknown digits (8 for Player 0, 8 for Player 4) is relatively low, especially since Player 4 just made the bid and likely has some 4s, but the previous bids on 4s were lower.

Player 4 Reasoning: It's my turn to open the bidding. I want to choose a digit from my hand that I have in relatively high quantity to give myself a strong starting position. My hand is 34078484, which contains three 4s and two 8s. The digit I have the most of is 4 (three times). Therefore, I'll start with a conservative but solid opening bid of 3 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have one '4' in my hand. Since the bid is low and I only need to increase it, I will bid 3 5s, which is a valid higher bid by digit while keeping the quantity the same. This is a reasonable bid given the current state and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 34078484, which contains the following digits: 3, 4, 0, 7, 8, 4, 8, 4. Counting the 5s in my hand, I have 0. The current bid is 3 5s, meaning Player 0 claims there are at least three 5s among the 16 digits. Since I have none, all three would need to be in Player 0's hand, which is possible but somewhat unlikely (the probability of having 3 or more of a specific digit in 8 random digits is low). Given the riskiness of bidding higher with no 5s in my hand and the likelihood that Player 0 is bluffing or stretching, the optimal play is to challenge.
