Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning I can make any initial bid. I have 8 digits in my hand: 9, 2, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, and 7. I see that I have two 2s, which is the highest count of any digit in my hand. Starting with a bid of '2 2s' seems reasonable as it's based on my own hand and leaves room for others to bid higher or challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have three 2s in my hand (digits 7, 7, 6, 1, 3, 4, 2, 6). Since I have at least three 2s, I can safely bid higher. The next logical step is to increase the quantity to 3, which I know is possible given my hand. Bidding 3 2s is a valid and safe move, as it exceeds the current bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s. Raising to 3 6s (same quantity, higher digit) is valid and I'm guaranteed at least three 6s, making this a safe bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 0s, one 2, one 9, one 8, one 4, one 9, and one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s. I have zero 6s, so I can't be confident about challenging. With 48 digits in play, the expected count of any digit is about 4.8, so 3 6s is plausible. I can make a safe higher bid based on my hand. I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s is a legal and reasonable higher bid (same quantity, higher digit), and keeps pressure on the next players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 27630090. I have one 8. The current bid is 3 8s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4.8. A bid of 3 8s is below the average and seems plausible, especially since I have one 8. I should bid higher. My hand has three 0s, two 2s, one 3, one 6, one 7, and one 9. Bidding on a digit I have multiple of is generally safer. Bidding 4 0s is a valid higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand and the current bid is 4 0s. To make a safe raise, I can keep the quantity at 4 and raise the digit to 4, which is valid. With an expected 4 4s among the other 40 cards, the probability of seeing at least one more 4 (for a total of 4) is about 98.5%, making this a very safe bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s made by Player 5. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. I have the digits 9, 2, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 7 in my hand. I can see that there are multiple 2s in my hand, and I can try to make a bid based on this information. Since the current bid is 4 4s, I can try to bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. I will bid 5 2s as my bid, increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s, meaning there are at least five 2s across all hands. I have two 2s in my hand, so I can't possibly meet or exceed that bid. Challenging now is the safest move, as the total number of 2s cannot reach 5 with my two 2s and the remaining players' hands. The previous bid is likely bluff or overestimation by Player 0, so I should challenge to verify the actual count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', which means I can make any initial bid. I have the digits 9, 2, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, and 7 in my hand. I see that I have three 2s, which is a relatively high count for a single digit in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, the total number of digits is 40. Starting with a bid of '4 2s' seems reasonable as it's higher than what I have in my hand, considering the total possible count and the goal to start with a believable bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold three 6s in my hand. Bidding 4 6s is strictly higher than 4 2s and with three in hand there’s over a 95% chance there’s at least one more among the other 32 cards, making this a very safe bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 20984980, which contains two 6s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in play. The current bid is 4 6s. Statistically, each digit appears about 4 times on average (40/10). I have two 6s, so it's plausible that there are at least 4 6s in total. However, it's not an outrageous bid, so challenging now is risky. To make a legal bid, I must bid either 4 7s, 4 8s, etc., or 5 of any digit. My hand has three 8s and two 0s, making 4 8s plausible. I'll bid 4 8s, as I hold three myself, making it likely there are at least four in total.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:4 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 27630090. I have one 8. The current bid is 4 8s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. The current bid is exactly the average, and I only have one 8. While it's possible there are four or more 8s among the other four players, it's not highly probable. The previous round saw a high bid of 5 2s which was true (8 2s). However, the current bids are still relatively low. I have two 0s, one 2, one 3, one 6, one 7, one 9, and one 8. Bidding 5 of any digit seems risky given the current bid is only 4 8s. Bidding 4 of a higher digit is an option, but I don't have strong counts in higher digits. Given the average and my hand, challenging 4 8s seems like a reasonable risk at this point in the round.

Player 4 Reasoning: I am the first to bid in this round. I have three 0s in my hand. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 4 0s is a reasonable starting point, reflecting the frequency of 0s in my hand and the overall probability.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have zero 0s in my hand. There are only 24 unknown digits among the other players, with an expected 2.4 zeros and only about a 21% chance of seeing four or more. A bid of 4 zeros is unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. To bid 4 4s I need only one more among the 16 unknown digits, which has over an 80% chance. This makes 4 4s a strong, plausible opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s made by Player 5. I have the hand 92851227, which contains two 4s. Given that there are 24 total digits remaining across 3 players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. The current bid of 4 4s seems plausible but I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. Since my hand only contains two 4s and there are two other players, I must assess if the total count of 4s can reasonably be 4 or more. I also need to consider if bidding higher or challenging is the best strategy.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have only one 2 in my hand, so the 16 unknown digits would need at least four more 2s to meet the bid of five 2s. The chance of that is under 10%, making the current bid very unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my turn to start bidding. I have the hand '92851227'. I count 2 '2's, 2 '7's, and the rest are different digits. Given that there are 16 digits in total for both players and no bids have been made yet, I should make a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand. Bidding '3 2s' seems like a good starting point as it reflects the number of 2's I have and leaves room for my opponent to respond.
