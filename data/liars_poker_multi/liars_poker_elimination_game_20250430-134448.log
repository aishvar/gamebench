Player 0 Reasoning: There are 48 digits remaining in total across 6 players. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s seems like a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that other players have at least one 8.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. There are 48 total digits among 6 players. The expected number of any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8. I have one 8 in my hand (23870752). The expected number of 8s among the other 40 digits is 40 / 10 = 4. So, the total expected number of 8s is 1 + 4 = 5. A bid of 3 8s is very likely to be true, making a challenge risky. I should make a higher bid. I have two 2s in my hand. The expected total number of 2s is 2 (mine) + 4 (expected others) = 6. Bidding 4 2s is a safe increase, higher than 3 8s, and supported by my hand and statistical probability.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have two 2s in my hand. I could bid 5 2s, or I could try to bid on a different digit. Since the bid is relatively low, and I have two 2s, increasing the quantity to 5 seems like a reasonable move. It doesn't reveal too much information about my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand, and there are 6 players with 8 digits each (48 total). For there to be 5 twos, there would need to be 4 more twos among the other players' 40 digits. This is quite plausible. Given I have two 8s in my hand, and Player 0 initially bid 3 8s, I can confidently bid 6 8s, which is higher than 5 2s and supported by my knowledge of at least 2 eights.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s made by Player 3. I have 8 digits in my hand: 4, 3, 0, 4, 0, 2, 6, 0. I see that I have one 6 and two 0s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48 and there are 48 total digits remaining, a bid of 6 8s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid. Since my hand contains one 6, bidding higher on 6s seems reasonable. However, I should also consider if challenging could be more beneficial if the bid seems unlikely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. To beat this, I could bid 8 0s, but with only 48 total digits, it's unlikely that there are that many zeros across all hands. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, one 3, one 6, one 2, and one 7, but no zeros. The previous bids on 8s (Player 0 and Player 3) seem to be attempts to push high counts on 8s, which I doubt. Challenging the current bid of 7 0s seems safe because it's highly improbable that there are 7 zeros in total, given my hand and the total number of digits. Therefore, I will challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The previous bid of 7 0s was challenged and found to be false, indicating there are fewer than 7 zeros in total. My hand contains two 0s, which suggests zeros are not very common in the game. Since no current bid exists, I can start by making a conservative bid to gauge opponents' hands. Bidding 3 0s seems reasonable, as I have two zeros, and it's unlikely the total zeros across all hands reach 4 or more, reducing the risk of challenge. Alternatively, I could bid higher, but starting low minimizes the risk of immediate challenge and provides room to escalate later.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current round has no bids yet, so I can start by making a bid. Looking at my hand (55136237), I have the following counts: 5 (twice), 1 (once), 3 (once), 6 (once), 2 (once), 7 (once). The most common digit I hold is '5' with two copies. Since no previous bid exists, I can bid 2 5s as a safe starting point, or I could go higher to put pressure on others. Bidding 2 5s seems reasonable given my hand and the total remaining digits (32).

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. With 32 total digits, the expected average count for any digit is 3.2. I hold one 5 myself, meaning only one more 5 is needed across the other 24 digits for the bid to be true. This is highly probable, so challenging is risky. I should place a higher bid. My hand contains two 2s (23870752). Bidding 3 2s is a credible increase over 2 5s. It leverages my hand strength and only requires one additional 2 among the other 24 digits, which is statistically likely.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have two 2s in my hand. I could bid 3 3s, or 4 2s. I think bidding 4 2s is a reasonable increase, and it takes advantage of the 2s I hold.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand, I only have one 2, and the current bid is '4 2s'. With 4 players having 8 digits each (32 total), and Player 2 claiming there are at least 4 twos, this seems plausible but risky. Looking at the bidding pattern, Players 1 and 2 seem confident about 2s, incrementing from 3 to 4. Given I only have one 2, and would need 3 more 2s among the other three players to make this bid valid, I think challenging is the safer option. The probability of having 3+ more 2s among 24 remaining unknown digits (when I only found 1 in my 8) seems low enough to warrant a challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s, and I have the digits 5, 5, 1, 3, 6, 2, 3, 7. Counting my 2s, I have only one 2. Considering the total remaining digits are 24 and previous bids, it seems unlikely that there are at least 3 twos in total. Challenging now could be advantageous, as the actual count of 2s is probably less than 3. Bidding higher on 2s or 3s would be risky given my hand. Therefore, I will challenge the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s made by Player 2. I have two 2s in my hand (23870752). This means the total number of 2s across both hands (16 digits total) is at least two. Therefore, challenging the bid of '2 2s' would result in a loss for me. I must make a higher bid. A higher bid can be either quantity 3 or more, or quantity 2 with a digit higher than 2. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding '2 7s' is a valid higher bid than '2 2s'. Since I hold two 7s, this bid is guaranteed to be true (the total count of 7s must be at least two). This is a safe bid that puts the pressure back on Player 2 without me taking any risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s made by Player 2. I have zero 9s in my hand (23870752). For the bid to be true, Player 2 must have at least two 9s among their 8 digits. While possible, challenging a low bid of 2 in a 1v1 situation is risky, as Player 2 could easily have two 9s. A safer approach is to make a higher bid based on my hand. I have two 2s. Player 2 previously bid 2 2s in this round, suggesting they likely have at least one 2. Therefore, bidding 3 2s is a very safe and credible bid, as it's highly probable there are at least three 2s between our hands. This bid is higher than 2 9s (quantity increases) and puts pressure back on Player 2.
