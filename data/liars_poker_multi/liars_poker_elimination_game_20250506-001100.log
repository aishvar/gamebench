Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It is the first bid of the round. I should make a reasonable starting bid based on my hand. I have two 3s, which is my most frequent digit. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8. Bidding '4 3s' is a plausible starting bid that reflects my hand strength in 3s and is close to the expected average count across all players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. I could challenge, but it's possible someone else has 3s. I have two 2s in my hand, so I could bid 4 2s, but that's risky. I have one 8, and it's unlikely that there are 4 8s in total, but I can't be sure. I have one 7, and it's unlikely that there are 4 7s in total, but I can't be sure. I have one 0, and it's unlikely that there are 4 0s in total, but I can't be sure. I have two 2s, so I will bid 5 2s, increasing the quantity and keeping the digit the same.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s made by Player 1. I have one 2 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have many high digits, bidding 6 2s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and I can account for at least one 2. However, I should also consider the likelihood of 5 2s being true and my own hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand of 63940489, I don't have any 2s. The current bid claims there are 6 twos among all players. With 6 active players and 8 digits each (48 total), 6 twos is possible but getting high. Given I have zero 2s and it would take 6 twos among the other 40 digits (not in my hand), that's still plausible at about 1 two per remaining player. Rather than challenge, I'll make a safer bid. Since I have two 4s in my hand, bidding 6 4s is a reasonable next move - keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit, which is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8. A bid of 6 4s is slightly above average, but not excessively high given the bidding history. I have two 8s and two 9s in my hand. Bidding 7 8s or 7 9s seems like a reasonable increase based on my hand and the current bid level. Bidding 7 8s is a valid higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 8s. My hand contains no 8s, so all 7 8s would need to be distributed among the other 5 players. With 40 digits remaining across those players, having 7 8s is possible but statistically less likely (average ~4.8 total 8s in the entire game). Given the risk of elimination and the improbability of the bid being accurate, challenging appears to be the optimal move.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. Starting the bidding at 4 1s leverages my own digits and aligns with the average expected count of 4 for that digit across all 40 digits. This bid is statistically plausible and sets a reasonable baseline for the round.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:4 - openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. My hand contains two 3s. With 40 total digits across 5 players, the expected count for any digit is 4. Bidding 4 1s is exactly the expected value, making it risky to challenge unless I had zero or very few 1s (I have one). Bidding higher is the safer option. Based on my hand strength in 3s (two of them), bidding on 3s is strategic. Bidding 4 3s would be a valid step up (same quantity, higher digit), requiring 2 more 3s from the remaining 32 digits (expected 3.2). Bidding 5 3s is a more significant step up (higher quantity), requiring 3 more 3s from the remaining 32 digits (expected 3.2). Given the low starting bid of 4 1s after the previous round's high bids, jumping to 5 of a digit I have multiple of seems like a reasonable and slightly aggressive move to push the bidding.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have two 3s in my hand. It's likely that at least 5 3s exist among all players. However, I have two 7s. Bidding 6 7s increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a strong bid. Challenging doesn't seem wise as the bid is plausible.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s made by Player 1. I have the digits 7, 3, 0, 1, 5, 8, 2, 9 in my hand, which means I have one 7. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 40 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Since I only have one 7, and there are 4 other players, the total count of 7s could reasonably be higher than 6. However, without exact information on other players' hands, I must make an educated guess. Bidding 7 7s seems too risky as it might be challenged and I could lose. However, bidding a slightly higher quantity or digit is possible. I can see that bidding 7 0s is a safe bet as it's higher in quantity than 6 7s and 0 is a commonly held digit, increasing the likelihood of it being true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand of 63940489, I have only one 0. The current bid claims there are 7 zeros across all hands (40 total digits). Given that I only have one 0, there would need to be 6 zeros among the other 32 digits held by other players. While possible, this seems unlikely as it would require about 19% of the remaining digits to be zeros. Additionally, Player 2's bidding pattern has been aggressive, raising from 6 7s to 7 0s. Given these factors, challenging seems like the safer option rather than having to bid 8 of something or 7 of a higher digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 0, one 3, one 4, one 6, one 8, one 9 in my hand. Since I'm starting the bidding in this round, I should make a conservative bid based on what I can see. With one 4 in my hand, bidding 4 4s is reasonable - it only requires 3 more 4s among the other 24 digits held by other players, which is quite possible. This is a safe opening bid that gives me room to maneuver later.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid of 4 4s requires at least four 4s in the remaining 32 digits. Since I have no 4s in my hand (Player 5), all four 4s must be in the other three players' hands. With 24 digits across Players 0, 1, and 3, the expected number of 4s is 2.4 (24/10), making a count of 4 statistically unlikely. Previous challenges in the game also showed bids exceeding actual counts, suggesting this bid may be vulnerable. Challenging offers a high chance of success.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s made by Player 5. My hand is 21360395, which contains two 3s. With 24 total digits remaining, the expected count for any digit is 2.4. Bidding on 3s leverages my hand strength. Bidding 4 3s requires a total count of at least four 3s. Since I have two, this means at least two more 3s must be present in the other 16 digits (expected 1.6). This is a plausible outcome and represents a valid, higher bid by increasing the quantity.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have two 3s in my hand, and I've seen at least two other 3s bid in previous rounds. However, I also have two 2s and two 7s, which haven't been bid yet. I could bid 5 2s or 5 7s, but that might be risky as others might have these digits. Challenging seems risky as well, since there are still 24 digits remaining. I'll bid 5 3s, increasing the quantity based on what I've seen.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have no 3s in my hand, so the entire count must come from Players 0 and 1. Given the history of successful challenges in this game (e.g., previous overbids like 7 8s and 4 4s), it's likely that Player 1's bid of 5 3s is inflated. With only 24 total digits remaining and no 3s in my hand, the probability of there being 5 or more 3s across the other two players' hands is low. Challenging aligns with the pattern of opponents overbidding and increases my chances of eliminating Player 1.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s by Player 5. My hand contains one 1. Player 5 likely has at least one 1 for their bid to be true. Challenging seems risky as a total of 2 1s is quite plausible with 16 digits. My hand has two 3s. Bidding 3 3s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity than 2 1s) and is plausible as it only requires Player 5 to have at least one 3 (2 from me + >=1 from them = >=3). This leverages my strongest digit count.
