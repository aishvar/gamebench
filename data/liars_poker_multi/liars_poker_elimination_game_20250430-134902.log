Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I can choose any valid bid. My hand contains three 4s, so starting with a bid of 3 4s is logical, reflecting the count in my own hand while setting a baseline for the game.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s. With 48 digits in play, it's likely there are at least three 4s among all hands. I can safely make a higher bid. I also have two 5s, so bidding 3 5s is a safe way to raise the digit without increasing the quantity, keeping my risk low.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand (25937436). The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 1. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For the bid of 3 5s to be valid, there need to be at least 3 fives total. I already have 1, so there would need to be at least 2 more among the other 5 players, which is quite reasonable. Since I have one 5, I know there are at most 47 other digits, of which at most 47/10 â‰ˆ 4.7 would be any specific digit on average. I could bid 3 6s (increasing the digit), 3 7s, 3 8s, or 3 9s, or I could increase the quantity to 4 of a lower digit. I have one 6 in my hand, which gives me some confidence. I'll bid 3 6s, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (27933541). To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have only one 6, bidding 4 6s might be risky. Instead, I can bid 3 7s, which is the same quantity but a higher digit, and I have one 7 in my hand, making this bid more plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected number of any digit is around 4.8 (48 / 10).  Since I have two 7s, it's plausible there are at least three 7s in total. However, the bid is already at 3 7s.  Bidding 4 7s would be a reasonable increase based on my hand and the remaining digits. Bidding a higher digit with the same quantity (like 3 8s or 3 9s) is also an option, and I have an 8 in my hand, making 3 8s a possibility. Bidding 4 7s seems slightly safer given I have two 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand (83229796) contains one 7. Challenging 4 7s is risky as the expected number of 7s among 48 digits is 4.8, making 4 7s a plausible bid. I must make a higher bid. My hand contains two 9s. Bidding 5 9s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity than 4 7s). This bid requires a total of five 9s among 48 digits. Since I have two 9s, this means three more 9s are needed from the other 5 players (40 digits). The expected number of 9s among 40 digits is 4. Therefore, 5 9s is a plausible bid based on my hand and probability, and it increases the quantity, putting pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. My hand contains one 9, and the average expected count for 9s across all players is ~4.8 (6 players * 8 digits * 1/10). Bidding 6 9s increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Challenging risks losing if the actual count is 5 or more, which is statistically likely. Bidding higher maintains pressure without immediate risk.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. In my hand (25561947), I have only one 9. With 48 digits in play and 6 players, the expected average for any digit is about 4.8. For 9s, a bid of 6 is slightly above average, but not unreasonable. However, I have only 1, so the likelihood that there are at least 6 9s is plausible but not certain. Challenging now is risky unless I have strong evidence. To stay in the game and avoid a risky challenge, I will make a higher bid. I have two 5s, which gives me some confidence to bid 6 5s, increasing the digit while maintaining the quantity.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 6 9s, which means there must be at least six 9s among the 48 digits. Statistically, each digit should appear about 4.8 times (48/10), so 6 is a slightly aggressive but plausible bid. However, with only one 9 in my hand, I am not confident enough to challenge yet, as it's early and someone could have multiple 9s. To stay in the game and apply pressure, I'll make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit to 0 while keeping the quantity at 6, resulting in '6 0s'.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. In my hand (25561947), I have one 9. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total), the expected number of any digit is about 4.8. A bid of 6 9s is already above average, and I only have one 9, making it unlikely there are 6 or more 9s in total. Since the probability is low that there are 6 or more 9s, I will challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains three 4s. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid that reflects my hand's strongest digit (4s) is logical. Bidding 3 4s establishes a baseline that aligns with my cards while leaving room for higher bids in subsequent turns.

Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (25937436), I have one 4 in it. Player 0 has bid 3 4s, which means they believe there are at least 3 fours among all players. Since I have one 4, there would need to be at least 2 more 4s among the other players for this bid to be valid. With 5 players each having 8 digits, this is quite reasonable. I could challenge, but it's a risky move this early in the game. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have three 3s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 3s, but I need to make a higher bid than '3 4s'. I could bid '3 5s', '3 6s', '3 7s', etc., or increase the quantity to '4 4s' or higher. Since I have one 7 in my hand, bidding '3 7s' seems reasonable.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand, which supports the bid somewhat. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can either increase the quantity to 4 with any digit or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit to 8 or 9. Given that 7s have already been bid, and 9s are high digits, bidding 4 4s seems like a safe increase in quantity and digit, also considering 4s were previously bid and are common. This bid is reasonable and not too risky.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. The current bid is exactly the average. While it's plausible, it's not overwhelmingly likely, especially considering the previous bids have been increasing. I have one 4, so I need three more 4s from the other four players. This is slightly less than the average expectation. However, given the relatively low bid and my hand, bidding higher seems safer than challenging at this point. I have two 7s, so bidding on 7s is a good option. Bidding 4 7s is a valid higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s, which is exactly the expected number of 7s across 40 digits (40 / 10 = 4). Challenging this bid is risky as the actual count is likely to be close to the expected value. I need to make a valid higher bid. My hand contains two 9s. Bidding 4 9s is a valid increase (same quantity, higher digit) and is supported by my hand, as I have two 9s. This is a relatively safe and strategic bid that leverages my hand strength without making an overly aggressive jump in quantity.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand (the third digit). The current bid is 5 9s from Player 0. With 5 active players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits in play. For there to be 5 9s, the other players would need to have 4 more 9s among them. This is certainly possible. I could bid 6 9s, but that would be risky since I only have 1. Looking at the previous round, Player 0 bid 6 9s and won when challenged, so they might have multiple 9s in their hand. I could increase the digit to 6 0s, but I don't have any 0s in my hand. I do have two 3s in my hand, so I could bid 6 3s. This is a safer bid based on my knowledge of my own hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. I have one '3' in my hand. Given there are 40 digits total and the bid is quite high, it is plausible but risky to bid higher. The next valid bid must be higher than 6 3s, so either 7 of any digit or 6 of a digit higher than 3. I have two '4's in my hand, which supports bidding 7 4s as a higher quantity and a digit I have some confidence in. Bidding 7 4s is a reasonable increase and not an extreme jump, so I will bid that.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count per digit is 4. A bid of 7 4s is above average but not outrageous, especially given the previous round's successful bid of 6 9s. However, I only have one 4, making it less likely that there are enough 4s to support a significantly higher bid. Given the current bid and my hand, challenging is a reasonable option as 7 4s might be a stretch, but bidding higher on 4s is risky. Bidding on another digit would require a significant jump in quantity or digit to be higher than 7 4s, and I don't have a strong concentration of any other digit to support that. Challenging seems like the safest move here.

I have one 7 in my hand, so challenging 3 7s is risky as it's close to the expected value and I hold one of the digits. My hand contains two 9s (83229796). Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity than 3 7s) and is well-supported by my hand. I only need two more 9s from the remaining 24 digits, which is close to the expected number of 9s among the other players (2.4). This feels like a strong and defensible bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The bid is at 5 9s. In my hand (25937436), I have one 9. For there to be at least 5 nines total, the other three players would need to have at least 4 more 9s between them, which is certainly possible. Looking at the history, Player 0 has been bidding on 9s consistently and won a challenge on 6 9s in an earlier round (when there were more players). Even with fewer players now, their confidence in 9s suggests they might have several in their hand. Since I only have one 9, I could challenge, but it seems risky given the history. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I could bid 6 0s, 6 1s, etc., but since I don't have many of those digits, I'll bid on a digit I actually have in my hand. I have two 3s, so I'll bid 6 3s, which is higher than 5 9s.

A bid of 6 3s is significantly higher than this expectation. While it's possible there are many 3s hidden, the bid seems somewhat aggressive, especially considering the previous rounds' bidding patterns.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s. The current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). With two 9s in my hand, I only need one more 9 from the remaining 16 digits across two players for the bid to be true. This is a highly probable scenario, making 3 9s a safe bid. Challenging the current low bid of 3 7s, which was made by Player 4 (suggesting they might have some 7s), seems riskier than making a safe bid based on my hand strength.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s, which is the highest possible digit. To make a valid higher bid, I must increase the quantity. Since the digit cannot be higher than 9, bidding 4 9s is the only option. This follows the rule that a higher quantity is required when the digit is already maxed out. My hand contains one 9, and while the actual count of 9s across all players is unknown, increasing the quantity is the logical next step.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the expected number of any given digit is around 2.4 (24 / 10). A bid of 4 9s is already quite high, especially since I have none. The probability of there being at least four 9s among the other two players is not very high. I have two 7s, so bidding on 7s might be an option, but I would need to bid at least 5 7s to beat the current bid, which is risky with only two in my hand. Given the high current bid and my lack of the bid digit, challenging seems like the most strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. There are 16 total digits across two players. My hand contains one 7. For the bid of 3 7s to be true, Player 4 must have at least two 7s in their hand of 8 digits. Based on probability (Binomial distribution B(8, 0.1)), the chance of Player 4 having 2 or more 7s is approximately 19%. This means there is about an 81% chance that the total count of 7s is less than 3. Challenging this bid offers a high probability of winning the round and the game.
