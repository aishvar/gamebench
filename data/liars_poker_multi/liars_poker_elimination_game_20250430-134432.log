Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, which matches my hand alone, so it's likely there are more 8s among the other 40 digits. Therefore, I can safely increase the bid to 3 8s, as this is a minimal increment and keeps the bidding conservative.

Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand of 12435454, I have zero 8s. For the bid of '3 8s' to be true, there would need to be at least 3 eights among the other 5 players' 40 digits. While this is possible, I have strong evidence against it since I see no 8s in my hand. Additionally, I see many 4s and 5s which suggests these digits are more common in this round. Given this is early in the game and the bid is still relatively low, challenging now could eliminate Player 1 while the risk to me is minimal.

Player 1 Reasoning: I am the first to bid in this round. My hand is 79216848, which contains two 8s, two 1s, one 9, one 2, one 6, and one 4. Since I have two 8s, and 8s were bid successfully last round, starting with a conservative but plausible opening bid makes sense. I will bid 2 8s, matching my own count, to avoid overcommitting early.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are 40 digits in total. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. I should consider the likelihood of there being only 2 8s in total. Since I have one 8, if the other players have a reasonable distribution, it's possible but seems a bit low. I can try to make a higher bid or challenge. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s by Player 4. I have one 4 and one 5 in my hand, but no zeros. The bid of 4 0s is somewhat unusual since zeros are less common, but it is a valid bid. The next higher bid must be at least 4 1s or higher. I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding 4 5s is reasonable, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This bid is plausible given the total digits and my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have 2 8s and 2 5s in my hand. Player 5 bid 4 5s. I can improve the bid by increasing the digit to 6, as I have no 6s in my hand, but it's a reasonable risk. Alternatively, I can challenge the bid as it's not extremely unlikely, but I'd rather make a new bid to potentially win.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 79216848, which contains one 5. The current bid is 5 5s, meaning there must be at least five 5s among all 40 digits. With five players and 8 digits each, the expected number of any digit in all hands is 4 (40/10). Since I only have one 5, for the bid to be valid, there must be at least four more 5s among the remaining 32 digits, which is possible but slightly above average. However, it's not so improbable that I should challenge yet. The next valid bid would be 5 6s, and my hand has one 6, which is similar odds. To avoid taking a risky stand too early, I will make a minimal higher bid: 5 6s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 1. I have one 6 in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are 40 digits in total. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Bidding 6 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity slightly, considering my own hand and the possibility that others might have a few 6s as well. However, I should also consider the likelihood of having 5 or more 6s in total, which seems plausible given the distribution. I will increase the bid to 6 6s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I could bid 7 0s, which is a safe increase. However, given the bidding history, particularly Player 1's and Player 3's focus on 8s, it might be more strategic to challenge. But 6 6s isn't an outrageous bid, and I only have one 6. I'll play it safe and bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s, which means at least seven zeros among 40 digits. I have one zero in my hand. Given the rarity of zeros and the previous bids focusing on digits 5 and 6, this bid seems plausible but high. To raise, I must increase the quantity or keep quantity 7 but increase digit. I have one '5' and two '7's but no '6's. Bidding 7 1s is the next valid step, but I have no '1's in my hand. Bidding 8 0s is also possible but risky. Since 7 zeros is already high and I only have one zero, I think it's safer to challenge this bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have no bids yet this round and my hand contains one 7, one 1, one 4, one 5, one 6, and two 4s total. Since the current bid is None, I need to start with a low but reasonable bid. Digit 4 appears twice in my hand, so starting with 2 4s is a safe and credible opening bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. Given my hand contains 2 8s and 1 6, I can make a reasonable bid by increasing the quantity or digit. However, I have no 4s in my hand, so I should increase the digit to 6, which is the next highest digit I have.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 79216848, which contains two 6s. The current bid is 2 6s, and since I alone already have two 6s, it's highly likely that there are more 6s among the remaining 24 digits held by the other three players. Therefore, I can comfortably make a higher bid, and the safest next bid is to increase the quantity to 3 6s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 1. I have 8 secret digits: 11836108. I see that I have one 6 in my hand. Given that there are 3 other active players and a total of 32 digits remaining, bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity from the current bid. Alternatively, I could challenge, but given that I have a 6 and the bid is not extremely high, increasing the bid seems safer.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (positions 2 and 6), which supports the plausibility of the bid. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity to 5 or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. Since 4 7s is higher than 4 6s and I do not have any 7s, bidding 4 7s is a reasonable step to increase the bid without overcommitting. Challenging now seems risky because the bid of 4 6s is plausible given my hand and the total digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 79216848, which contains two 6s. The current bid is 5 6s. With 4 players and 32 digits in play, the average count per digit is about 3.2, but the distribution can vary. Since I hold 2 of the 6s, there need to be at least 3 more among the 24 unknown digits for the bid to be valid. This is plausible but not guaranteed. However, challenging at 5 6s is risky, as it's likely there are at least 5 in total. To stay safe and keep pressure, I will make the minimum valid higher bid: 5 7s. I have one 7, and it is possible others do as well.

Given that there are 4 active players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 32 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. Since the bid is 5 7s, I need to assess if it's likely or not. With only one 7 in my hand and no information about others, I must consider the possibility of challenging. However, bidding seems more strategic as I can increase the quantity or digit. I have one 7 and can bid higher with a different digit. Bidding 5 8s seems reasonable as it's higher in digit and I have an 8 in my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (the digit 8 appears once). Given there are 32 digits total, a bid of 5 8s is plausible but somewhat high. I can bid higher either by increasing the quantity or keeping the quantity at 5 and increasing the digit. I have one 7 in my hand and two 5s, but the current bid is on 8s. Increasing the quantity to 6 0s is the next valid bid, but 0s are not in my hand. I have two 5s, so bidding 5 9s would be higher in digit but I have no 9s. The safest next higher bid is 6 0s, which is higher quantity and digit 0 is the lowest digit, making it a reasonable bid. Since I have no 0s, this is a bit risky, but challenging now might be premature. Therefore, I will bid 6 0s.

Given that there are only 32 digits in play and I've just seen a failed bid for 7 0s in the previous round (actual count was 2 with 40 digits), it's extremely unlikely that there are now 7 zeros among 32 digits.

Given that there are 24 total digits and 3 players, it's possible that the total count of 8s could be 2 or more, especially since Player 1 might also have an 8. However, bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. But first, I should consider if challenging could be more beneficial, given that 2 8s might be an overestimation considering the total digits available. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I will assess the likelihood of 2 8s being true. With 24 digits and 3 players, if Player 1 has an 8 and I have one, that's 2 8s right there, making 2 8s a plausible bid. I will make a higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (71475645). There are 24 digits total across 3 players, so 3 8s is a reasonable bid. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. I don't have many 8s, but I do have one 7. Bidding 3 9s is possible but risky since I have no 9s. Instead, I can increase the quantity to 4 and choose a digit I have, like 5 or 7. I have two 5s and one 7. Bidding 4 5s or 4 7s is a strong bid based on my hand. Since 4 5s is lower digit than 4 7s, I will bid 4 7s as it is higher and more aggressive.

Since I have 2 of the 7s, that leaves only 2 more needed among the other 16 digits, which is plausible but not guaranteed. However, challenging at 4 7s is risky since it is possible, and I should only challenge if the bid is very unlikely. To stay safe and keep the pressure on, I will make a higher bid. I also have two 8s, and both 8s and 7s are relatively high digits, but since I have more information about 8s, I can raise the bid to 4 8s, which is the minimum legal bid above 4 7s.

I can bid 5 9s, which is a minimal increase and plausible since there are 24 digits in total and 3 players. Since I have no '9's, this is a risky bid but better than challenging immediately.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 79216848, which contains two 9s. The current bid is 5 9s. With three players, there are 24 digits in play. Since I have two 9s, there need to be at least three more 9s among the other 16 digits for the bid to be valid. The probability of this is not particularly low, but it's not guaranteed either. However, since there are likely to be more than five 8s (I have two 8s), and the previous bidding history has focused on 8s, I can safely raise the bid to 6 8s, which is a higher quantity and a digit that seems strong based on my hand and the recent focus on 8s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s made by Player 1. I have 8s in my hand (11836108), specifically two 8s. Given that there are only 24 digits in total and three players, the bid of 6 8s seems high but not impossible. However, I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more strategic. Since my goal is to either make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should assess the likelihood of there being 6 or more 8s. With my two 8s, if the other players have a reasonable distribution, it might be possible but seems unlikely. I should calculate the maximum possible 8s: if I have 2, and assuming the other two players could theoretically have all 8s, that's 2 (mine) + 16 (max for 2 players) = 18, which is not possible as it exceeds the total digits available (24). Therefore, a bid higher than 6 8s seems risky without more information. Challenging seems like a safer option given the high bid and the distribution of digits.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current round has just started with no bids yet. I, Player 3, have the hand 11836108. I should start by making a conservative bid based on my hand. I have one 8 and other digits, so bidding 1 8s seems like a reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (digit '7 1 4 7 5 6 4 5' does not include 8), so I do not have any 8s. The bid is very low, so it is safe to increase the quantity or digit. The next valid bid must be higher than 1 8s, so I can bid 2 0s or higher. I have two 4s and two 5s, but no 0s. Bidding 2 0s is reasonable as it is a low quantity and digit, and it is likely there are at least two 0s in total across both hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s made by Player 5. I have the hand 11836108, which contains two 0s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. The bid of 2 0s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. My hand contains one 8 and two 0s. A bid higher than 2 0s could involve increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 8, bidding on 8s seems reasonable. However, bidding 3 8s seems aggressive given that I only have one 8 and Player 5 could also have 8s. I should consider if challenging is more prudent or if a conservative bid increase is better.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand (digit '0' appears once in 71475645). Given there are 16 digits total and only one 0 in my hand, bidding higher than 3 0s is plausible. The next higher bid can be either 3 1s or 4 0s. Since I have no 1s, bidding 4 0s is safer, as it raises the quantity and is a valid bid. Challenging now would be risky because 3 0s is not an extreme bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s made by Player 5. I have 8 secret digits: 11836108. I see that I have three 0s in my hand. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and Player 5 has 8 digits as well, the maximum possible quantity for 0s is 16. However, bidding 5 0s seems reasonable as it's higher than 4 0s and I have a substantial number of 0s in my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have two 0s in my hand (digits: 7,1,4,7,5,6,4,5), so the total of 0s needed to meet the bid is quite high considering only 16 digits total. It is possible but somewhat risky. I can raise the bid by increasing the quantity to 6 0s, which is a natural progression and still plausible given the total digits. Bidding 6 0s is a valid and reasonable move.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s made by Player 5. I have 8 secret digits: 11836108. I see that I have three 0s in my hand. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and Player 5 has 8 digits as well, the bid of 6 0s seems suspiciously high because even if Player 5 has all 5 remaining 0s, we would only have 8 0s in total. I should challenge this bid.
