Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 48815420, which has two 8s, and one each of 4, 1, 5, 2, and 0. Starting with a conservative bid based on my strongest digit, I will bid 3 8s, assuming there might be at least one more 8 among the other players' hands. This keeps the bid low enough to be believable while still leveraging my own hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 2/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (10460600), I don't have any 9s. The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 2. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, so 48 total digits. Player 2 is claiming there are at least 4 nines among all players. I don't have any, so all 4+ would need to be among the other 5 players' 40 digits. This is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it seems risky as the probability of at least 4 nines among 40 random digits is reasonable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have three 0s in my hand, so bidding 5 0s seems strategic - I'm accounting for my three 0s and assuming there are at least two more among the other 40 digits, which is quite likely.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s and one 0 in my hand. Since there are no current bids, I can start with a low bid. I will bid 3 8s, slightly higher than Player 0's initial bid from the previous round, and reflecting the two 8s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand out of the total 40 digits across all players. The current bid is 3 8s by Player 4. Since I already contribute two 8s, it's plausible that there is at least one more 8 among the other 32 digits, making the bid of 3 8s reasonable. However, I need to make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity to 4 8s or bid on a higher digit with at least 3. Given that I have two 8s, bidding 4 8s feels risky as it relies on there being two more 8s in the remaining 32 digits. Instead, I’ll bid 3 9s, which is a higher digit with the same quantity, as a safer incremental increase without overcommitting on a digit I have limited information about.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which requires at least three 9s in total. Since I already have two, increasing the quantity to 4 9s is a logical next step to maintain pressure. This bid is strictly higher (4 > 3) and leverages my existing 9s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. Since I have a 9 in my hand, I should bid 5 9s, increasing the quantity by one, as it's more likely than bidding a higher digit.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:0 - claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (10460600), I have zero 9s. The current bid is 5 9s made by Player 2. With 5 players each having 8 digits, there are 40 total digits in play. For there to be 5 9s, and knowing I have none, the other 4 players would need to have an average of 1.25 9s each (5 ÷ 4 = 1.25). This is certainly possible. However, the bidding pattern shows increasing confidence in 9s, with three consecutive bids on 9s, moving from 3 to 5. This suggests other players might have several 9s in their hands. I could bid 6 9s, but that's risky given I have none. I could switch to another digit, but I'd need to bid at least 6 of something. I have three 0s in my hand, which is significant, but we already saw 7 zeros in the previous round when there were 48 total digits. Now with fewer digits (40), there are likely fewer 0s as well. My safest option is to challenge the current bid of 5 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding in this round. Looking at my hand (10460600), I have three 0s and one each of 1, 4, and 6. Since I have three 0s myself, there's a good chance there are more 0s among the other players. In the previous round, we saw that there were at least 7 zeros when 6 players were active, suggesting zeros are common. Starting with a bid based on my strongest digit makes sense. I'll bid 4 0s, which is conservative but reasonable given I already have 3 in my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, but that might be risky. I could also bid 4 1s, 4 2s, etc. I don't have any other information to go on, so I'll make a slightly safer bid of 5 1s.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:3 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 48815420, which contains no 1s. The current bid is 5 1s by Player 4. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 5 1s means that on average, there should be about 1.25 1s per player. Since I have zero 1s, the other three players would need to have all 5 among them, which is possible but not highly likely. However, challenging now feels risky as 5 is still a relatively low number for 32 digits. Instead, I can make a safer bid by increasing the quantity or digit. I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding on 8s could be reasonable. I’ll bid 5 8s, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: Since I am the first to bid this round, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s seems like a safe starting point. There are 24 total digits remaining, so it's not unreasonable to assume there are at least three 8s in total.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 48815420, which contains two 8s. The current bid by Player 4 is 3 8s, meaning they are claiming there are at least three 8s across all 24 digits. Since I already have two 8s, it only requires one more 8 from the other 16 digits (8 from Player 1 and 8 from Player 4) to meet the bid, which is quite plausible. Challenging now carries a high risk of losing, as the probability of at least one more 8 existing is reasonable. Instead, I will make a higher bid. I can bid either a higher quantity or a higher digit. Bidding 4 8s seems safer since I already contribute two 8s, and it’s not a huge stretch to assume two more 8s exist in the remaining 16 digits. This keeps the bid conservative while still increasing it.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 48815420, which contains one 0. The current bid is 5 0s by Player 4. With only 24 total digits across three players, a bid of 5 0s means that, besides my one 0, there need to be at least 4 more 0s in the remaining 16 digits from the other two players. This is possible but somewhat unlikely, as it would require a high concentration of 0s. However, looking at the bidding history, Player 4 has bid on 0s multiple times, including a successful bid of 6 0s in an earlier round when there were more players. This suggests they might have a few 0s in their hand. Given the risk of challenging and being eliminated if wrong, and considering I can make a safer higher bid, I will bid 5 1s. I have one 1 in my hand, and it’s a reasonable increment from the current bid of 5 0s by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. My hand contains two 1s, but I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit. Bidding 5 2s is valid as it maintains the same quantity but uses a higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 48815420, which contains no 2s. The current bid by Player 4 is 6 2s, meaning there should be at least 6 twos across all 24 digits in play. Since I have none, the other two players (Player 1 and Player 4) would need to have at least 6 twos combined in their 16 digits. This is possible but seems unlikely given the distribution, as it would require a high concentration of 2s in their hands. However, looking at the bidding history, Player 4 has been aggressive with bids, and they might be bluffing to push the bid higher. I could challenge, but there is a risk since 6 out of 24 is only 25% of the digits, which is plausible. Alternatively, I can make a higher bid. My strongest digit is 8, with three in my hand, and the last bid on 8s was 4, so I can bid higher on 8s. Bidding 6 8s feels safer since I contribute 3 to the count, and only 3 more are needed across the other 16 digits, which is reasonable. Given the risk of challenging and the plausibility of 6 2s, I’ll opt to bid higher instead of challenging.
