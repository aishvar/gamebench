Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I can choose any valid bid. My hand contains three 1s, so starting with a bid of 3 1s establishes a reasonable baseline based on my cards. This bid is both quantitatively and digit-wise valid for the first move.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. The current bid of 3 1s seems reasonable as it only requires 2 more 1s among the other 40 digits I can't see. Given my hand has three 8s, I can make a confident bid of 3 8s, which is valid as it keeps the same quantity but uses a higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand out of the total 48 digits across all players. The current bid is 3 8s by Player 1. Since I already contribute two 8s, it’s plausible that there is at least one more 8 among the other 40 digits. However, to play it safe and push the bid higher, I will bid 4 8s, increasing the quantity while staying on the same digit. This bid leverages my own hand strength and tests the other players’ confidence in the count of 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '4 8s'. Looking at my hand (13098439), I have one 8. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For the bid '4 8s' to be valid, there need to be at least 4 eights among all players. I already have 1 eight, so there would need to be at least 3 more eights among the other 5 players, which is certainly possible. Additionally, Player 1 bid '3 8s' before Player 2 increased it to '4 8s', suggesting Player 2 might have at least one 8 as well. Given this information, challenging seems risky. I'll make a higher bid instead. I could bid '5 8s', but that might be pushing it given I only have 1 eight. A safer option would be to increase the digit, such as '4 9s'. I have one 9 in my hand, so this bid would require 3 more nines among other players, which seems reasonable.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 6 0s is valid and plausible since 0 is a common digit. Bidding 6 0s is a safer increment and challenges others to raise the quantity further.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. My hand contains three 1s, and bidding 6 1s is a valid higher bid since the digit (1) is higher than 0. This leverages my existing digits while adhering to the rules of increasing the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I only have one 1, and the current bid is '6 1s'. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total), having 6 1s is possible but seems unlikely. The previous bidding pattern shows escalating quantities, and Player 0 has now bid on 1s twice - first with 3 1s and now with 6 1s, which could indicate bluffing. Given I can see only one 1 in my hand, for the bid to be true, there would need to be 5 more 1s among the other 40 digits. While mathematically possible, this seems improbable given the aggressive bidding pattern and Player 0's behavior.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 86557047, which contains no 1s. The current bid is 3 1s by Player 0. With 5 players and 40 total digits, an average of 4 digits per digit value (0-9) is expected across all hands. A bid of 3 1s is below average and quite plausible. I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. I have two 5s and two 7s in my hand, so bidding on 5s or 7s could be reasonable. I'll bid 4 5s, increasing both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 3 1s, as it aligns with my hand strength and seems believable.

Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (13098439), I have zero 5s. Player 2 has bid 4 5s, meaning they believe there are at least 4 fives among all 40 digits in play. With 5 active players having 8 digits each, this is certainly possible. However, since I don't have any 5s in my hand, all 4 would need to come from the other 4 players' hands (32 digits total). I could challenge, but it's a reasonable bid. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have one 9 in my hand, which gives me some confidence. I'll bid 4 6s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value, which makes a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I need to bid higher, either by increasing the quantity or keeping the quantity at 5 and increasing the digit. I have one 6 in my hand. Since 6 is already the digit bid with quantity 5, the next valid bids could be 5 7s or 6 0s. I have one 2 and one 3 in my hand, but no 7s. Bidding 5 7s is a small increase and plausible. Bidding 6 0s might be risky without any 0s in my hand. Therefore, I will bid 5 7s, increasing the digit and keeping the quantity the same.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. My hand has no 7s, and the game history shows no prior bids on 7s, suggesting it might be a bluff. Challenging this bid could eliminate Player 5 if the actual count is less than 5, which is plausible given the lack of prior 7s in bids.

I don't think challenging is wise yet since the bid is low. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 5s and two 7s in my hand, so bidding on 5s seems reasonable.

Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of 4 5s. In my hand (13098439), I have zero 5s. For the bid to be valid, there need to be at least 4 5s among all players. With 3 players having 8 digits each, there are 24 total digits. Player 2 has bid 4 5s, which means they likely have at least 1-2 5s in their hand. Player 0 started with a relatively conservative bid of 3 1s, which doesn't give me much information about their hand. Looking at the previous rounds, Player 2 has consistently bid on 5s, suggesting they might have several in their hand. However, I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since I have two 9s in my hand, I could bid 4 9s, which would be a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This is a reasonable bid based on my knowledge of my own hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 86557047, which contains two 5s, one 6, one 8, one 0, one 4, and two 7s. The current bid is 5 1s by Player 0. I have no 1s in my hand, so I must estimate the likelihood of there being at least 5 1s across all 24 digits. Given that there are only 3 active players with 8 digits each, and I have none, the other two players would need to have at least 5 1s combined. This seems possible but not highly likely, as it would require one or both of them to have a significant number of 1s. However, challenging now is risky because if the count is 5 or more, I lose. Instead, I can make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 5 1s, I can bid 5 2s or higher. I have two 7s, so bidding 5 7s feels reasonable, as it increases the digit while maintaining the quantity, and I contribute two to the count. This seems safer than challenging at this stage.

Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '5 7s' made by Player 2. Looking at my hand (13098439), I have only one 7. With 24 total digits in play and 8 digits per player, there are 16 digits in other players' hands. For the bid '5 7s' to be true, there would need to be at least 4 more 7s among the other players, meaning 25% of their remaining digits would need to be 7s. This seems quite high but not impossible. However, I also notice that Player 0 previously bid '5 1s', which Player 2 chose to raise rather than challenge. This suggests Player 2 might have some 7s in their hand. Given that I only have one 7, and the bid requires 5 total, I think challenging is risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding '6 0s' or '6 1s' seems reasonable. I have one 0 and one 1, so either would be based on what I actually have. I'll go with '6 0s' as it's a significant raise that forces the next player to either bid high or challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s made by Player 0. In my hand, I have no 1s, which means I contribute nothing to the count of 1s. With a total of 24 digits across all players, a bid of 6 1s means that the other two players would need to have a significant number of 1s for the bid to hold. Based on the bidding history, Player 0 has consistently bid on 1s, which might indicate they have a few, but it's still a risk. However, challenging now could be risky since 6 out of 24 is not an unreasonable frequency (about 25% of the digits). Instead, I’ll make a higher bid to push the game forward and test the other players. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 6 7s feels plausible as it increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid. This bid leverages my own hand strength while staying within a reasonable range.

Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current game state carefully. In my hand (13098439), I have zero 7s. The current bid is '6 7s' made by Player 2. With 3 players having 8 digits each, there are 24 total digits in play. For the bid to be valid, Player 0 and Player 2 combined would need to have at least 6 sevens between them. This means 6 out of their 16 digits (37.5%) would need to be 7s, which is quite high. Looking at the bidding pattern, Player 2 seems to favor 5s and 7s, suggesting they might have some 7s. However, 6 seems like a high quantity. I could bid higher (either '7 7s' or '6 8s'), but given I have no 7s in my hand, I think challenging is the better option here.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I'm starting a new round with only Player 0 and myself remaining. I have 8 digits in my hand: 13098439. Analyzing my hand, I have: one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 8, one 9, and no 2s, 5s, 6s, or 7s. Since I'm making the first bid of the round, I should bid based on what I have in my hand. I have one 9, so bidding on 9s could be strategic. A conservative starting bid would be '2 9s', suggesting there's at least one more 9 in Player 0's hand, which is reasonable. This gives me room to maneuver in future rounds while putting some pressure on my opponent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s by Player 3. My hand contains no 9s, and with 16 total digits remaining, it's uncertain if Player 3 has at least two 9s. Challenging this bid could expose the true count, which might be less than 2, giving me a chance to eliminate Player 3.
