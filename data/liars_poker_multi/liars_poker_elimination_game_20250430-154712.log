Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. With 40 unknown digits and an expected average of about 4.8 per digit, bidding 3 5s is very likely to be true and establishes a moderate opening bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 84208950, which contains no 5s. The current bid is 3 5s by Player 0. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits, a bid of 3 5s is quite low and plausible. I don't have any 5s myself, but it's reasonable to assume others might. I’ll make a higher bid to keep the game moving. I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding 4 8s feels like a safe increase in both quantity and digit, leveraging my own digits while still being within a believable range.

Player 1 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet in this round and I am starting the bidding, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand is 84208950, which includes two 8s, two 0s, and one each of 4, 2, 9, and 5. With 40 total digits across 5 players, a bid of 3 8s seems reasonable as I already have two 8s, and it's likely at least one more 8 exists among the other 32 digits. This is a safe starting bid that is not too aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (02431371), I don't have any 8s. Player 1 has bid 3 8s, which means they believe there are at least 3 eights among all players. In the previous round, we discovered there were 6 eights when there were 48 total digits. Now we have 40 total digits, and one player (Player 2) has been eliminated. Player 2 might have had some 8s in their hand, reducing the total count. Since I don't have any 8s in my hand, I need to either make a higher bid or challenge. I could bid 3 9s, which is higher than 3 8s, or I could increase the quantity to 4 of a lower digit. Based on my hand, I have two 3s and two 1s, which gives me some confidence. I'll bid 4 1s, which is higher than the current bid and aligns with my hand's strength.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I don't have any 1s, but I can bid higher by increasing the quantity to 5 and choosing a digit I don't have many of. I have two 6s, two 7s, and one each of 0, 2, and 4. I'll bid 5 0s. It's a slightly risky bid, but better than challenging without any information.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 4, one 5, one 8, one 9, one 6, one 3, one 4, and one 7 in my hand. This means I have two 4s, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 7, one 8, and one 9. The current bid is 5 0s. A bid of 6 0s or higher would be a valid increase. Given I have no 0s, bidding on 0s is risky. I have two 4s. Bidding 6 4s seems plausible with 5 players and 40 total digits, as it implies an average of slightly more than one 4 per other player. This is a valid bid that is higher than 5 0s.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have only one 4 in my hand, so for there to be six 4s among the 40 cards there must be at least five 4s among the other 32 cards—a probability of only around 20–25%. The current bid of 6 4s seems unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first to bid in this round. I have two 4s, one 5, one 8, one 9, one 6, one 3, and one 7 in my hand. With 4 players and 32 total digits, a bid of 3 of any digit is a reasonable starting point, as the expected count of any digit is around 3.2 (32/10). I have two 4s, so bidding 3 4s is a safe and reasonable opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 84208950, which contains one 4. The current bid by Player 5 is 3 4s, meaning they are claiming there are at least three 4s across all 32 digits. Since I only have one 4, there need to be at least two more 4s among the other 24 digits from Players 3, 4, and 5. This is plausible, as it's roughly an average of less than one 4 per player. I don't think challenging is wise here, as the bid seems reasonable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 8s in my hand, which is a strong presence for that digit. Bidding 4 8s feels safe since I already contribute two to the count, and it's likely there are at least two more 8s among the other players, given the total of 32 digits. This bid increases both the quantity and the digit from the current 3 4s, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the likelihood of there being at least 4 8s in all players' hands combined. In my hand (02431371), I have 0 8s. The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 1. Looking at the game history, Player 1 previously bid 3 8s in the last round, and when Player 2 challenged their bid of 4 8s in the first round, there were actually 6 8s total. This suggests Player 1 might have multiple 8s in their hand. With 32 total digits remaining among 4 players (8 digits each), having 4 8s is certainly possible. Since I don't have any 8s, the other 3 players would need to have at least 4 8s between them, which is about 1.33 8s per player on average - quite reasonable. I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. I have two 1s in my hand, which gives me some confidence in bidding on 1s. I'll bid 5 1s, increasing the quantity.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. I could bid 6 of some digit, but that feels risky. Bidding 6 0s is probably the safest bid, as it's unlikely there are more than 5 ones, and I don't have any information to suggest a higher count of any other digit. However, it's still early in the round, and challenging might be too aggressive. I will play it safe and bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I need to bid higher. My hand is 45896347. I have two 4s, one 5, one 8, one 9, one 6, one 3, and one 7.  There are 32 total digits remaining.  A bid of 6 0s is somewhat high, but not impossible. I have no 0s. Given the current bid and my hand, bidding 6 of a higher digit or increasing the quantity seems appropriate. I have two 4s, so bidding 7 4s is a slight increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 6 of a higher digit. I have a 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Bidding 6 5s is a valid bid and increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This feels safer than increasing the quantity to 7.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s made by Player 5. In my hand, I have one 5, which means I contribute only 1 to the total count of 5s. With 32 total digits across all 4 players, the maximum possible count for any digit is 32, but realistically, digits are distributed somewhat evenly. A bid of 6 5s means that, excluding my 1, the other 3 players must collectively have at least 5 more 5s among their 24 digits. This is possible but not highly likely, as it would require a significant concentration of 5s. However, challenging carries a risk of elimination if the bid is correct. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, and the history shows some bids on 8s, including my own bid of 4 8s earlier in this round. Bidding 7 8s could be a safer move, increasing the quantity and switching to a digit I have some strength in. This bid is higher than 6 5s and seems plausible given past bidding patterns and my own hand. I’ll avoid challenging for now and make a strategic bid instead.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand, I have no 8s. Player 1 has bid 7 8s, which means they're claiming there are at least 7 eights among all 32 digits. From the game history, Player 1 previously bid 4 8s in an earlier round, and when challenged, there were actually 6 eights at that time (with 48 total digits). Now we're down to 32 total digits, and Player 1 is claiming there are 7 eights. This seems suspicious since I have zero 8s in my hand, and the proportion of 8s would have had to increase significantly despite fewer total digits. I could bid 7 9s or 8 0s, but challenging seems like the better option given the information I have.

Player 3 Reasoning: I'm starting a new round with 3 players, each having 8 digits, for a total of 24 digits in play. Looking at my hand (02431371), I have: two 1s, one 0, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 7, and no 5s, 6s, 8s, or 9s. Since I'm opening the bidding, I should make a conservative bid based on what I know is in my hand. I have two 1s, so bidding '2 1s' would be safe. However, I could be slightly more aggressive and bid '3 1s', betting that at least one more 1 exists among the other 16 digits held by my opponents. This is a reasonable opening bid that balances safety with competitiveness.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 45896347, containing two 4s and one of each other digit. The current bid is 4 2s. I have zero 2s. With 24 total digits, a bid of 4 2s implies that on average, each player would have over one 2. This seems plausible but not guaranteed. I have two 4s, making a bid on 4s attractive. I can bid 5 4s, which is a valid higher bid and directly supported by my hand. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit I have, but increasing the quantity to 5 is required to beat 4 2s. Bidding 5 4s seems like the most reasonable move given my hand and the current bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. In my hand, I have one 4 (02431371). The current bid is 5 4s across all players. With 3 players having 8 digits each, there are 24 total digits in play. For there to be 5 4s, the other two players would need to have 4 more 4s between them, which is possible but not guaranteed. Looking at the history, Player 5 has been aggressive with bidding, previously bidding 6 4s in an earlier round (which turned out to be accurate). This suggests Player 5 might have multiple 4s in their hand. Given that I only have one 4, I have two options: make a higher bid or challenge. If I challenge and am wrong, I'm eliminated. If I bid higher, I need to be strategic. I could bid 5 5s, 5 6s, etc., or increase the quantity to 6 of a digit I have more of. I have two 1s and one 3 in my hand. I'll bid 6 1s, as I already have two 1s and it's a reasonable increase from the current bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge Player 5's bid of 3 4s. Looking at my hand (02431371), I have one 4. Since there are 16 total digits in play (8 from me and 8 from Player 5), and I know I have one 4, that means Player 5 would need to have at least 2 fours for their bid to be valid. This is certainly possible. I have two 1s and two 3s in my hand, so I could confidently bid 3 1s or 3 3s, but these wouldn't be higher than 3 4s. I could bid 4 1s or 4 3s, but I'd be relying on Player 5 having some of these digits. Since I'm not confident in challenging, I'll make a reasonable bid of 4 1s, as I already have two 1s in my hand and only need Player 5 to have two more, which seems plausible.

Player 3 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge Player 5's bid of 5 4s. Looking at my hand (02431371), I have only 1 four. For Player 5's bid to be valid, they would need to have 4 fours in their hand. While this is possible, it seems somewhat unlikely. Let me analyze further: I have 8 digits in my hand, and Player 5 has 8 digits. The total number of 4s claimed is 5 out of 16 total digits. Since I only have 1 four, Player 5 would need to have 4 fours (50% of their hand). This is possible but quite high. Additionally, Player 5 has consistently bid on 4s throughout this round, suggesting they might indeed have several 4s. However, I have 3 ones in my hand, so I could bid 6 1s to continue. Given the uncertainty and that Player 5 seems confident about 4s, I'll make a higher bid rather than challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '7 4s' made by Player 5. In my hand, I have one 4 (in position 3). With 16 total digits in play and 8 in each player's hand, there are 7 digits in Player 5's hand that I can't see. For the bid to be true, Player 5 would need to have at least 6 more 4s in their hand, which means 6 out of their 7 unknown digits would need to be 4s. This is extremely unlikely. Even if they were bluffing with their previous bids of '3 4s' and '5 4s', having 6 of the same digit in a hand is statistically improbable. Additionally, Player 5 has consistently bid on 4s, which suggests they might have some, but probably not 6. Given these factors, challenging is the better option than making a higher bid like '7 5s' or '8 0s'.
