Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to start with a reasonable bid based on my hand. My hand contains two 3s and two 4s. Bidding 3 3s is a cautious opening that leverages my existing digits while allowing room for escalation. With 48 total digits, this bid is conservative and likely to be safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 4 3s would be a valid and reasonable increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have two 9s, one 6, one 2, and one 1. Bidding 3 4s, 3 5s, 3 6s, 3 9s would also be valid. However, given my hand, increasing the quantity of 3s seems the most logical and least risky option. Bidding higher digits might be bluffing too much at this early stage.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 3 and two 8s in my hand. The current bid of 4 3s is likely to be true since the average total count for any digit is 4.8. Challenging would risk elimination. Bidding 4 8s leverages my two 8s and follows the higher-digit rule, maintaining a strategic bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have the digits 7, 2, 5, 4, 9, 2, 0, 0. Counting my 8s: I have no 8s. The total number of 8s across all players is unlikely to reach 4, especially since I have none. Challenging the bid seems prudent as the likelihood of there being at least 4 eights is very low.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and in the previous round, a bid of 4 8s was validated with a total of 5. This suggests 8s are reasonably common. Starting with 3 8s seems plausible given the reduced player count (5 players, 40 total digits) and my existing holdings.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:2 - o3-2025-04-16) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand (9 and 9). The current bid is 3 8s. By raising the digit while keeping the quantity the same, I can legally outbid with 3 9s. Because I already possess two of the needed 9s, only one more 9 must be present among the 32 unknown digits held by the other four players. Under a random distribution, the probability that at least one 9 appears in 32 digits is 1 – 0.9^32 ≈ 96%. This makes 3 9s a very safe bid while forcing the next player either to increase the quantity or switch to an even higher digit/quantity combination.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. I could bid 4 0s, which is a safe but potentially weak bid. However, I have one 8 in my hand. Since Player 2 previously bid 3 8s, and the current bid is only 3 9s, I will bid 4 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. My hand contains no 0s, but I have one 1. Bidding 4 1s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Given that there are 40 total digits and I have one 1, it is plausible there are at least four 1s across all players' hands. Challenging the current bid carries higher risk due to uncertainty about the actual count of 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Bidding 5 1s would be a reasonable bluff, as it's a small increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, such as 2 3s. However, given the previous bids and eliminations, it seems players are willing to bid relatively high. Increasing the quantity of 1s feels like a plausible continuation of the bidding war, and is the simplest valid bid. Bidding on a different digit runs the risk of being challenged quickly if I don't have enough of that digit to support a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 5 8s is a valid higher bid than the current 5 1s (same quantity, higher digit). This leverages my existing holdings and applies pressure on opponents, potentially forcing a challenge or further escalation. Given the history of bids on strong digits (e.g., previous 4 8s bid had a revealed count of 5 in the last round), this bid carries plausible risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s and two 9s. Challenging the current bid of 5 8s is dangerous: with only three more 8s needed among the 32 unknown digits, the chance the bid is correct is roughly 60-65%. Instead, I can outbid by keeping the quantity at 5 but moving the digit up to 9. Because I already hold two 9s, I only need three more among the other 32 digits; under a uniform distribution that happens about 63% of the time, and opponents who see few 9s themselves may be tempted to challenge, giving me favorable odds. This is the smallest legal raise and leverages the strength of my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I don't have any 9s in my hand. Bidding 6 0s is a safe increase, as it's unlikely anyone has a large number of 9s. I could also bid higher on other digits, but without knowing other hands, bidding the minimum increase is safest.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s made by Player 5. I have no 0s in my hand, and with 5 active players, the total digits are 40. Bidding higher (e.g., 6 1s or 7 0s) introduces uncertainty, as I lack 0s and have limited 1s. Challenging is viable because the required 6 0s seem unlikely given my hand and typical distribution. Even if others have 1-2 0s, the total is likely below 6. A challenge leverages this doubt strategically.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round, I need to make an initial bid. My hand contains two 3s and two 4s. Bidding 3 3s is reasonable because I have two, and there's a good chance at least one more exists in the other players' hands. Starting with a moderate bid based on my own digits minimizes risk while establishing a baseline for the round.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 4 3s is a valid and conservative move, slightly increasing the quantity. While I could bid a higher digit, given the previous rounds and the elimination of players who bid high digits, sticking with 3s seems strategically sound. It's unlikely someone has a large number of 3s given the previous bids, but I don't want to challenge immediately.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Since the current bid is 4 3s, bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). With 32 total digits remaining and my own two 8s, there's a plausible chance of at least four 8s existing across all hands, making this bid strategic.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I hold two 9s. To beat the current bid of 4 8s I can make the minimal higher bid by keeping the quantity at 4 and raising the digit to 9s. With 24 unseen digits in the other three hands, the chance that at least two more 9s are present is about 70%, giving my bid a good likelihood of being valid if it’s challenged. Challenging the existing bid would only have roughly a 29% chance of success based on expected counts, so raising is the better option.

Player 4 Reasoning: I’m the first to act this round. In my 8-digit hand I see two 8s. Player 2 has repeatedly bid on 8s in previous rounds, so they probably have at least one more. With 24 total digits in play, the chance that there are at least three 8s overall is high, and this is a reasonable, not-too-aggressive opening bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. Given the limited number of total digits remaining (24) and the previous eliminations, a bid of 3 8s seems plausible but not overwhelmingly so. I have two 9s. Bidding 4 9s would be a reasonable escalation, increasing the quantity. However, given the history of challenges succeeding when bids seemed high, and my lack of 8s, challenging seems more strategic.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I am the opening bidder this round. Out of my 8 digits I have two 8s, which is already close to the expected total of 1.6 for any single digit across both hands. Statistically the opponent will hold at least one 8 in better than half of the cases, so a total of three 8s is more likely than not. This makes an immediate challenge risky for the opponent while keeping the quantity low enough to give me flexibility for later raises.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid of 3 8s requires at least one more 8 in Player 4's hand. Given the high likelihood that Player 4 has at least one 8 (57% probability based on random distribution), challenging is risky. Bidding 3 9s is a logical next step to escalate the bid, leveraging the possibility that Player 4 may not have strong 9s to support a higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I can already account for two 9s in my own hand. Player 2 just committed to a bid of 3 9s, which they are unlikely to make unless they hold at least one and more likely two 9s themselves. If they do have two (or more) 9s, the total reaches four or higher, so a bid of 4 9s should still be true the vast majority of the time. This is the smallest legal raise, keeps the pressure on Player 2, and offers a much better chance of success than challenging the current bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid of 4 9s requires Player 4 to have all four 9s in their hand since I have none. Given the improbability of Player 4 holding exactly four 9s in their 8-digit hand, challenging is the optimal move to avoid escalating with a risky bid.
