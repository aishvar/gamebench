Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to set an initial bid. My hand contains two 2s and two 8s. Bidding 3 2s is reasonable because I have two, making it likely there is at least one more in the remaining 40 digits. This bid is conservative yet sets a baseline for the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s, which I know is almost certainly present (I have one 2 and expect ~4 more among 40 unknown digits). Rather than challenge, I should raise the bid. I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding 3 5s only requires one more 5 among the remaining 40 digits (probability ~98.7%), making this a safe increase in digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand, which already contributes significantly to the current bid of 3 5s by Player 1. Since the bid is already met by my own digits, I believe it's safe to raise the bid slightly. I will bid 4 5s, increasing the quantity while staying on the same digit, as I suspect there might be more 5s among the other players' hands given the total of 48 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have the hand '14309705', which contains one 5. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 48 digits in total and 6 players, a bid of 4 5s implies an average of less than 1 '5' per player. Given that I have one 5, it's plausible that the total count of 5s is at least 4. However, bidding more than 4 5s might be risky. I can bid 4 6s, which is a valid higher bid. My hand has one 6 (from '6' in 14309705, but there's no 6, there's a '9'), actually it has no 6, so the likelihood of others having 6s is unknown but I can still make a reasonable guess. Let's bid 4 6s.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 3. Since I have two 6s, I can increase both the quantity and the digit, so I will bid 5 7s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 5 7s, which means there would need to be at least four more 7s among the other five players (total of 40 digits). Given that 7s are not extremely common and the bid has already escalated to 5, it's unlikely there are that many 7s. Challenging seems like the best move.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is None, and I'm the first to bid in this round. I have two 6s in my hand. Given that the previous round saw a bid of 4 6s, starting with a conservative bid of 2 6s seems reasonable, as it's based on my hand and leaves room for others to increase the bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s. Bidding 2 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit) and is guaranteed true since I already have two 8s. Challenging the current bid (2 6s) would risk elimination if the actual count meets or exceeds 2, which is likely given the number of digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 2 8s, so I need to increase the quantity. With my two 6s plus an expected ~3.2 6s among the 32 unknown digits, there’s a high probability of at least three 6s in total. Bidding 3 6s is a safe way to outbid the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:4 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 59754943, which contains no 6s. The current bid is 3 6s by Player 1. With 5 active players and a total of 40 digits, the average number of any digit across all hands would be around 4. Since I have zero 6s in my 8 digits, the likelihood of there being at least 3 6s in the remaining 32 digits is plausible (needing roughly 1 6 per 10 digits). However, I can make a higher bid to push the game forward and test others. I’ll bid 4 6s, increasing the quantity, as it’s a reasonable escalation without overcommitting. Alternatively, I could challenge, but I think the bid of 3 6s is still within a believable range.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have the hand '14309705', which contains one 6. So, I have at least one 6. The total count of 6s across all players must be at least 4 (since the current bid is 4 6s and it's made by Player 2, and I also have one 6). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Increasing the quantity to 5 6s seems plausible because it is still below the maximum possible quantity of 40 and not extremely high given the total count of digits is 40. Bidding 4 7s is another option, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit. I will analyze my hand for the digit 7; I have one 7. So, 4 7s is a reasonable bid as it is higher than 4 6s and I know there's at least one 7 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s, which seems high given that there are only 40 digits total and 5 players. The previous challenge showed that bids around 5 can be risky. Since I don't have strong evidence to support a higher bid, challenging seems prudent.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s. Bidding 3 2s increases the quantity, making it a valid higher bid. Since I already have two 2s, requiring one more 2 in the remaining 24 digits (across 3 players) is plausible. This balances aggression with the evidence from my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 59754943, which contains three 5s. The current bid is 3 5s by Player 1. Since I already have three 5s in my hand, the bid is met just by my contribution, but it's unlikely that there are no other 5s among the other 24 digits across the remaining players. I think it's safe to raise the bid slightly. I will bid 4 5s, as it seems plausible given my hand and the total digits remaining (32). This also keeps the digit the same but increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. I don't want to jump to a higher digit or much higher quantity yet, as it might invite a challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding for this round. My hand is 59754943, which gives me two 5s, two 9s, and single digits of 7, 4, and 3. With a total of 24 digits across all players, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 3 5s seems reasonable as I already have two 5s, and it's likely that at least one more 5 exists among the other 16 digits held by the other two players. This bid sets a moderate starting point for the round.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. My hand contains one 5. With 24 total digits and an expected average of 2.4 fives, the bid of 3 is slightly above average. The probability that the actual count is less than 3 (0, 1, or 2) is higher than it being 3 or more, making a challenge statistically favorable. Additionally, the other players' hands likely contain fewer than two additional 5s, leading to a total count below the bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet in the current round and I am starting the bidding, I can make a conservative opening bid. My hand is 59754943, which contains three 9s and two 5s, among others. With only two active players and a total of 16 digits, I should bid based on my hand strength while leaving room for escalation. Bidding 3 5s is reasonable as I have two 5s myself, and it's plausible that Player 1 has at least one 5. This bid also aligns with my previous successful bid of 3 5s in an earlier round, which had a count of 5, suggesting 5s might be common.

Player 1 Reasoning: I hold two 6s. Raising the current bid of three 5s to three 6s is a legal upward move (same quantity, higher digit) and only requires one more 6 in Player 2’s hand, which is reasonably likely given eight unknown digits. Bidding is preferable to challenging the three 5s, which has only about a 43% chance of success.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 59754943, which contains two 5s, one 7, one 9, one 4, and one 3, but no 6s. The current bid by Player 1 is 3 6s. Since I have no 6s in my hand, the likelihood of there being at least three 6s in the total 16 digits depends entirely on Player 1's hand. Given that there are only 8 digits in their hand, it's possible but not guaranteed that they have three or more 6s. However, bidding higher is safer at this stage. I can bid 4 5s since I already have two 5s, and it's plausible that Player 1 has at least two more 5s in their hand, making the total count feasible. This bid increases the quantity and seems reasonable based on my hand strength.
