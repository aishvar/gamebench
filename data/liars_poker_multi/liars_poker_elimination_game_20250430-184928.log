Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game, and I need to start with something reasonable. Looking at my hand (93790611), I have two 1s, one 0, one 3, one 7, one 9, and two 6s. Since I have two 6s in my hand, I can reasonably assume there are more 6s among the other players. With 6 players total and 8 digits each (48 total digits), the average count for any digit would be 4.8. Starting with a conservative bid of 5 6s seems reasonable - it's slightly above average but supported by my own hand containing two 6s already.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand and there are 40 unknown digits. The expected number of 6s is 4, and the probability of there being at least 5 sixes is only about 40%, so it’s more likely the bid of 5 sixes is false. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I'm starting this round, so I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (93790611), I have: one 9, one 7, one 3, one 0, and two 1s. The most frequent digit in my hand is 1, with two occurrences. Since I'm opening the bidding, I want to make a strategic bid that balances being truthful about what I know while not being too conservative. With 5 players having 8 digits each (40 total digits), and me having two 1s, I can reasonably estimate there might be around 8-10 ones total (assuming roughly even distribution). A bid of 7 1s seems reasonable - it's based on my actual hand knowledge but not so high that it's easily challengeable.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:4 - claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand. With 5 active players having 8 digits each (40 total), and Player 0 bidding 7 1s, this means there need to be 6 more 1s among the other 32 digits I can't see. While possible, this seems unlikely given that I only see one 1 in my 8 digits (12.5% frequency). If this distribution held across all hands, we'd expect about 5 total 1s. The bid of 7 seems too high, especially as the opening bid of the round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and have '31957896' in my hand. I see one '1', one '3', one '5', one '7', one '8', one '9', and one '6'. Since I have one '9' and it's a high digit, starting with a moderate quantity like 3 9s could be a good strategic move. This leaves room for escalation while being reasonably achievable given my knowledge of one '9'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 2. I have one 9 in my hand. Given that there are 3 other active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total possible count for any digit is 32. The bid of 3 9s seems plausible but not extremely high. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 9, bidding a higher quantity seems reasonable. I will bid 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, so Player 4 needs four more 9s among the 24 cards in the other players’ hands. The probability of at least four 9s out of 24 is only about 21%, making this bid unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Opening with 3 8s gives me a strong chance (~81.5%) that at least one more 8 is among the 16 unknown digits, and puts pressure on opponents—raising to 4 of any digit will be riskier.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. With 24 total digits and 3 players, the bid of 3 8s seems reasonable. Given my knowledge of having one 8, there only need to be two more 8s among the other 16 digits held by other players to make this bid valid. Rather than challenge, I should increase the bid. Since I also have a 9, bidding 3 9s is a safe increase that maintains the same quantity but uses a higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 2. I have 8 secret digits: 60667591. I see that I have one 9 in my hand. Considering the total digits remaining is 24 and there are 3 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. Given that Player 2 and Player 5 have already bid on different digits with the same quantity of 3, I should consider the likelihood of 3 or more 9s existing. Since I only have one 9, I need to assess if it's plausible for the other players to have at least two 9s combined. A bid of 4 0s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and I have a 0 in my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. To meet the bid of 4 0s, the other two players must hold at least three zeros among their 16 cards. The probability of that is only about 20%, making this bid very unlikely to be true. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand (31957896). With only 16 total digits in play and knowing I have just one 8, Player 5 would need to have at least one more 8 for their bid of '2 8s' to be valid. Given they made this bid, it's likely they have at least one 8. Since the bid is relatively conservative (only claiming 2 eights), I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. Looking at my hand, I have a 9, so I can safely bid '2 9s', which is higher than '2 8s' while staying conservative.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I hold two 8s and the opponent likely has at least one more with probability ≈1–0.9^8≈0.57. Challenging 2 9s only wins ≈0.43 of the time. To beat 2 9s I must bid quantity 3, and bidding 3 8s leverages my two 8s with ~57% chance of being correct, making it the strongest play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The opponent claims there are at least three 8s total, which means they would need to have at least two 8s in their hand to make this true. While possible, this seems unlikely given the previous bidding patterns. Also, they increased from their own previous bid of 2 8s, suggesting potential bluffing. With only 16 total digits in play and seeing my own hand, I think challenging is safer than making a higher bid.
