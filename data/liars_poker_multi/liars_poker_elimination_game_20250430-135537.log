Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 16950531, which contains two 5s and one each of 1, 6, 9, 0, 3. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and the total number of players. I have 8 digits, and there are 5 other players, so I should consider the likelihood of digits being present across all hands. Bidding 8 5s seems reasonable as it reflects a relatively high confidence in the count of 5s given my hand and the fact that I'm starting the bidding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, and the current bid of 8 5s requires 8 total across all players. With only 40 remaining digits (excluding my hand), the expected number of 5s is 4. The bid of 8 is double that average, making it statistically unlikely. Challenging the bid is a calculated risk to eliminate the possibility of a false claim.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains three 8s, which is the highest digit I hold. As the first player to bid, I need to establish a baseline. Bidding 4 8s is reasonable because I have three, implying at least one more 8 exists across the remaining 32 digits (4 players x 8 digits). This bid is conservative yet assertive, leveraging my strong digit count.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:0 - o3-2025-04-16) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I can see one 8 and one 9 in my eight digits. The current bid is 4 8s. Challenging is risky because, with 32 unseen digits, the probability that there are at least three more 8s (making the total ≥4) is well over 50%. Instead, I’ll make the smallest legal raise: keep the quantity at 4 but move the digit up to 9. I have a 9 myself, and statistically the chance that there are at least three more 9s in the remaining 32 digits is reasonable (~60%). Raising to 4 9s also forces the next player to increase the quantity to 5 if they don’t want to challenge, putting them under more pressure.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, but that seems risky. I could bid 5 of any digit. I will bid 5 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s by Player 3. With my hand containing no 0s and the total digits across all players being 40, the likelihood of there being at least 5 zeros is low. Previous bids like 8 5s were challenged and failed, suggesting players may be bluffing. Challenging 5 0s could expose a bluff, especially since the actual count of zeros is likely below 5.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains three 5s. Since the current bid is None, I can initiate with a bid that reflects my hand's composition. Bidding 3 5s is a logical starting point based on my cards.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (78421739), I don't have any 5s. Player 4 bid 3 5s, which means they're claiming there are at least 3 fives across all 32 digits. Given the previous rounds, Player 4 has shown some conservative bidding. While 3 5s is possible, I only see zero 5s in my hand (which is 25% of all digits). The probability of finding 3 or more 5s in the remaining 24 digits (75%) when I know 8 digits have none is relatively low. Additionally, Player 4 starting with a relatively low bid might indicate uncertainty. I'll challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains three 5s. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid based on my hand's highest count (3 5s) is logical. This allows me to establish a baseline without overreaching, while keeping the option to increase later if needed.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:1 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. Bidding 4 8s increases the quantity and focuses on a digit I hold. Given my three 8s and the possibility of at least one more in the remaining 16 digits (from two other players), this bid is plausible. Challenging the 3 5s bid carries risk since the expected count of 5s is ~2.4, but the actual count could still be 3. Bidding leverages my known holdings for a safer move.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:0 - o3-2025-04-16) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I can see one 8 in my own hand. If Player 1 was willing to open with 4 8s, they almost certainly hold several 8s themselves—very likely two or three. That already puts the total at 3-4 before even looking at Player 4’s eight unknown digits, so reaching five 8s across the 24 digits is quite believable. Challenging 4 8s would therefore be dangerous, but increasing the quantity by one keeps the same digit and puts pressure on the others while remaining plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have no 8s in my hand (32714555), and the total digits remaining are 24. Bidding 6 5s is a valid higher bid since I have three 5s, and increasing the quantity to 6 is a logical next step. This avoids challenging a potentially credible bid while leveraging my hand's 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains three 8s. The current bid is 6 5s. Bidding 6 8s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, making it a valid higher bid. Since I have three 8s, it's plausible there are at least six 8s across all hands, especially considering the other two players have 16 digits combined. Challenging 6 5s is riskier because the other players could collectively hold exactly six 5s, making the bid true.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:0 - o3-2025-04-16) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I only hold one 8. To meet the bid of 6 8s, the other two players would need at least five 8s in their sixteen hidden digits. With an expected count of roughly two 8s among those sixteen, the probability of five or more is extremely low (around 2%). Raising would force me to claim something even less credible, so challenging is the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I begin the round, so any legal bid is acceptable. Opening with a low-risk bid is safest: 1 of a digit I actually hold. I have one 9, so the statement 'there is at least one 9 among both hands' is certainly true for me. Across 16 digits, the probability there is at least one 9 is about 81%, making an immediate challenge unattractive for Player 4. Using the highest digit (9) also forces them to raise the quantity rather than simply bump the digit. This keeps my risk minimal and gives me flexibility to challenge or outbid on the next turn.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand. The current bid is 1 9s, which is very low. Bidding 4 5s increases the quantity significantly, making it a valid higher bid. This leverages my hand's 5s and avoids the high-risk challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have only one 5 in my hand. For the bid of 4 5s to be valid, Player 4 would need at least three 5s in their eight digits. The probability of an 8-digit hand containing three or more of a specific digit is under 4 %, making the current bid extremely unlikely. Challenging now gives me a very high chance to win the game outright.
