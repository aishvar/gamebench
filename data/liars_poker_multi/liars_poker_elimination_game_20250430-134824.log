Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to set a reasonable opening bid. My hand contains three 7s, so bidding 4 7s is plausible. With 5 other players, it's likely there's at least one more 7 in their hands. This bid balances aggression with my known holdings.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have two 7s in my hand, which is a good starting point. Given the total digits remaining are 48, bidding 5 7s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:3 - o3-2025-04-16) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I possess three 3s. If I bid 6 3s, I already supply half of the required total; the other 40 hidden digits need to contain only three more 3s. With an expected 4 × 3s in those 40 digits (p≈0.1 per digit), the probability that at least three appear is around 78%, giving my bid a solid foundation. By contrast, challenging the current bid of 5 7s would succeed only about 42% of the time, so raising is preferable. Increasing the quantity to 6 keeps the bid strictly higher while shifting to a digit I’m strong in, making it risky for the next player to challenge immediately.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have zero 3s in my hand and expect only about 4 3s in the 40 unknown digits, so a total of 6 3s is unlikely (probability under 25%). The bid of 6 3s seems improbable and should be challenged.

Player 3 Reasoning: I hold five 5s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits among the other four players, the expected number of additional 5s is about 3.2, giving a total around 8.2. Bidding 6 5s is very likely to be true (~97% probability) while committing to a digit I have a strong advantage on.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have five 5s in my hand, so I know at least five exist. The chance that at least one more 5 is among the other 24 digits is about 92%, making a bid of 6 5s highly likely to be correct while setting a strong opening.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. With 32 digits in play, the expected number of any digit is about 3.2. The current bid is 6 5s, which is already above expectation, but a previous challenge of this same bid failed (actual count was 8), indicating that 5s may be unusually common in this group of hands. Since I am required to bid higher, I will make the minimal legal raise by bidding 6 6s, as I have one 6 in my hand, and it is less likely the count for 6s is as high as for 5s, but it keeps me in the game without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. The current bid is 6 6s. Bidding 6 7s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Since I have three 7s, it's plausible that there are at least six 7s across all players, making this a reasonable and defensible move.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have 1 7 in my hand. I can make a valid bid by increasing the digit, as I don't have a higher quantity of 7s. Bidding 6 8s seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I only have one 8 in my hand, so the other 24 unknown cards must contain at least five more 8s to meet the bid of 6 8s. With an expected 2.4 eights in those cards, the probability of five or more is under 10%, making this bid highly unlikely. I will challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have five 5s in my hand. Opening with 6 5s is reasonable because I only need one more 5 among the other 16 cards (about an 81% chance), and this bid builds on my strong holding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 6 5s, which means that there must be at least five more 5s among the other 16 digits held by the two opponents. This is unlikely, as the expected number of any digit among 16 random digits is about 1.6. Since 5s have not been strongly favored in previous rounds, and the probability of there being at least 6 total 5s is low, I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have five 5s in my hand. With eight opponent cards at a 10% chance each to be a 5, the expected opponent fives is ~0.8, so total fives expected ~5.8. Bidding 6 5s as the opening bid is a reasonable, slightly aggressive move.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:4 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand has three 7s, and the current bid is 6 5s. Since I have no 5s, the total 5s depend on Player 3's hand. Bidding 6 7s leverages my existing 7s and raises the digit, making it plausible if Player 3 has three 7s. Challenging risks losing if Player 3 has six 5s, which was true in a prior round. Bidding increases pressure while using my hand's strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have zero 7s in my hand, so the bid of 6 7s relies entirely on Player 0’s eight cards. The probability they hold six or more 7s in eight random digits is effectively zero, so I should challenge.
