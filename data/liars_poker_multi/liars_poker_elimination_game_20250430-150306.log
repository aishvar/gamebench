Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the bidding and there are no previous bids to consider, I should make a bid that is reasonable based on my hand. I have the digits 8, 7, 1, 3, 0, 9, 5, and 2. A safe approach would be to bid on a digit that I have at least one of, considering the total number of digits in play is 48. Since I have one 8 and it's a relatively high digit, bidding on 8s could be a good starting point. However, to keep the bid conservative and increase the chances of it being valid, I should start with a low quantity. Given that there are 6 players and each has 8 digits, bidding on a higher digit like 8 with a low quantity seems prudent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand (44811467). With 6 players having 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. Player 0 has bid 2 8s, which means they're claiming there are at least 2 eights among all players. Since I already have 1 eight, it's very reasonable that there's at least one more 8 among the other 40 digits I can't see. I should make a higher bid. I have two 4s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 4s. I could bid '3 4s' which would be higher than '2 8s' because of the higher quantity. This seems like a safe bid given I already have 2 of them in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have one 7, one 5, one 0, one 7, one 5, one 1, and one 0 in my hand, totaling 2 fours or lower digits that could be considered in a bid, but specifically, I have no 4s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 4s, I think 3 4s might be a bit high, but I should still consider the information from my hand and the previous bids. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I hold two 9s. By bidding 3 9s I only need one more 9 among the 40 unknown digits, which is highly likely (~98.5% chance). This also forces opponents to raise the quantity if they don’t challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 9s. The expected total number of 9s across all players (based on uniform probability) is around 4.8, making 4 9s a statistically safe bid. Challenging would risk elimination since the probability of there being fewer than 3 total 9s is very low (I have two, and others likely have at least one). Bidding 4 9s leverages my existing holdings and aligns with probabilistic expectations.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Since the previous bids were relatively conservative, I should bid higher to increase my chances of winning the game. Bidding 5 9s seems reasonable, as it's a higher quantity and digit compared to the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 9s and considering the total number of digits remaining (48), it seems plausible that there could be at least 5 nines among all players, given that each player has 8 digits. However, bidding higher than 5 9s requires either increasing the quantity, which would be risky given the total number of digits, or increasing the digit, which is not possible since 9 is the highest digit. Therefore, challenging the current bid seems like a reasonable strategy, especially since the bid of 5 9s is relatively high and the actual count of 9s might be lower, considering the distribution of digits among players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have a 9 in my hand. The current bid is None. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40, I can start bidding. I have no information about other players' hands, so I'll bid a small quantity of 1 and a high digit of 9 to increase the chances of winning.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge Player 5's bid of 1 9s. Looking at my hand (44811467), I don't have any 9s. Player 5 just bid 1 9s, which is a very conservative bid. In the previous round, there were 7 9s total, and even though one player was eliminated, it's highly likely there's at least one 9 remaining among all players. Since this is such a low bid and the previous round showed many 9s existed, challenging would be risky. I should make a higher bid. I have two 4s in my hand, so bidding on 4s gives me some confidence. I could bid 2 9s (higher quantity) or 1 0s (same quantity, higher digit in circular order). I'll go with 2 4s since I know I have those in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have one 7, one 9, one 5, one 0, one 7, one 1, and one 0 in my hand. I see two 0s and no 4s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 4s, I think the count of 4s is likely low. However, I need to make a bid higher than 2 4s. I can bid 2 5s or 3 Xs where X is any digit. Given my hand has a 5, I can reasonably bid 3 5s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. Bidding 3 9s is legal (same quantity but higher digit) and only requires one more 9 among the remaining 32 digits, which is over a 96% chance. This strong move forces opponents to raise the quantity.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which seems plausible given the average expected count of 4 for any digit across 40 total digits. Since the only valid higher bid requires increasing the quantity, I should bid 4 9s to maintain the streak and pressure opponents.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 4. I have two 6s in my hand, but I can also see that Player 4 has bid a lower quantity than Player 5 in the previous round. I should make a bid that is higher in quantity and digit than the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '5 7s' made by Player 5. Looking at my hand (44811467), I have one 7. With 5 players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits in play. For the bid to be valid, there need to be at least 5 sevens total. Since I have 1, that means there need to be at least 4 more 7s among the other 32 digits the other players have. This is certainly possible but not guaranteed. Looking at the bidding pattern, Player 5 started with 1 9s, then increased to 5 7s after other players bid on 9s. This suggests Player 5 might have some 7s. I could bid 6 7s, but that's risky without more 7s in my hand. I could bid 5 8s, but I only have one 8 in my hand. I could bid 6 4s, as I have three 4s, which gives me more confidence. This seems like the safest option based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. I have the digits 77950710, which means I have one 4. The total count of 4s across all players must be at least 6 to validate the current bid. Given that there are 5 players and each has 8 digits, it's plausible that the total count of 4s is around or more than 6, considering the distribution could be uneven. However, I can bid higher. I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have two 7s, which is a higher digit than 4, and considering the previous bid was 5 7s by Player 5, I should think carefully. Bidding 7 4s is a straightforward increase in quantity. Alternatively, bidding 6 5s is also valid as it increases the digit. Given my hand and the fact that I have one 5, I can reasonably bid 6 5s, increasing the digit from 4s to 5s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s is the highest possible bid at quantity 3, forcing any counter to jump to 4. I only need one more 9 among the 24 unseen cards (about a 92% chance), so this is a strong opening.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid of 3 9s requires at least one more nine in the remaining 24 digits across Players 1, 3, and 5. Given Player 3 initiated the bid and historical bids on 9s (e.g., 5 9s in Round 1 with an actual count of 7), it's plausible the total count meets or exceeds 3. Challenging risks elimination if the count is ≥3. Bidding 4 9s aligns with my hand and raises the bid appropriately.

Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 9s, I need to make a valid higher bid. Since I have a 9 in my hand, I can increase the quantity or digit. However, I also have a 6 in my hand, which might be useful for a higher digit. Considering the remaining digits, I should aim for a higher digit to increase my chances of winning. Bidding 4 6s would be a reasonable move.

Player 5 Reasoning: Player 4 bid 4 9s. I have 9 in my hand, so I can make a bid that is strictly higher than 4 9s. I can bid 4 9s with a higher quantity, but since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32, I can only increase the quantity by 1. However, I can increase the digit to 9, which is the same digit as the current bid. So, I can make a bid that is strictly higher than 4 9s by bidding 5 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '5 9s'. Looking at my hand (44811467), I have zero 9s. From the previous round, we know there were at least 7 nines when 6 players were active. In the next round with 5 players, Player 3 confidently bid 3 9s and Player 4 raised to 4 9s, suggesting they each have some 9s. Now with 4 players, the same pattern continues. Since I have zero 9s, and the other three players would need to collectively have at least 5 nines between them (less than 2 per player on average), this seems plausible. I could bid '6 9s', but that's risky. I could also switch to a digit I have more of, like '6 4s' since I have two 4s. However, given that I have no 9s and the bid is already at 5, I think challenging is the safer option.

Since the current bid is 2 9s, challenging would result in a loss because the actual count cannot be less than 2. To continue the game, I must make a higher bid. Bidding 3 9s leverages my existing 9s and assumes Player 3 has at least one more, which is plausible given the game's history of aggressive 9s bidding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I hold two 9s. The bid of 3 9s requires Player 4 to have at least one 9 among their 8 unknown digits. The probability they have one is 1 - 0.9^8 ≈ 57%, so there’s only a ~43% chance the bid is false. Any raise (e.g. 4 9s) would succeed only ~19% if challenged. Challenge now maximizes my win equity.
