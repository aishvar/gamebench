Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet and I have two 4s in my hand, starting with a conservative bid of two 4s seems reasonable. This gives me room to increase the bid in future turns if needed.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. With 40 unknown digits, there is a ~98.5% chance of at least one more 0, so bidding 3 0s is a safe raise over 2 4s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 4 0s is a safe increase in quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand (position 7). With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. For the bid of '4 0s' to be true, we need at least 3 more zeros from the other 5 players (since I have 1). This is quite possible given the distribution. Also, Player 1's confidence in bidding '3 0s' suggests they likely have at least one 0. I should make a higher bid. Since I have a 7, bidding '4 7s' would be a valid increase, and I already know of one 7.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. My hand is 57234816, which contains one 7. I have to assess the likelihood of the total count of 7s being at least 4. Given that there are 6 players and 48 digits in total, and considering my own hand has one 7, it's plausible that the total count of 7s could be around or more than 4, especially since the previous bids were on lower digits or lower quantities. I will increase the digit to make a higher bid. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable next step as it adheres to the rule of making a higher bid by increasing the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 8s is risky. I could bid 4 9s, but that's very unlikely to be true given the limited number of digits remaining and the previous bids. I could also bid a higher quantity with a lower digit, but 4 8s already seems quite high. Challenging seems like the best option, as it's unlikely there are four 8s in total across all players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None' as it's the start of the round and I am Player 4, who gets to bid first. I have the digits 57234816, so I have a total of 1 '0'. A reasonable starting bid should be low but not too low. I will bid 2 0s, as it's a conservative start and reflects a possible count given my hand and the total number of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have one 0 in my hand (from 44162827). With 4 other players, it's possible there are at least two 0s total, but the bid is already at the minimum quantity. Since I have one 0, I can safely bid a higher digit to keep the game going without much risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I hold two zeros in my hand. Raising the bid to 3 zeros only requires one more zero among the 32 unknown digits, which is very likely (expected ~3.2 zeros). Itâ€™s the smallest possible increase over 2 ones and leverages my known zeros, making it a safe bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. I can confidently bid 4 0s, as that's a safe increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand (position 6). The current bid claims there are 4 zeros total among all players. Given that I only have one 0, and the bidding history shows increasing confidence in zeros (2->3->4), it's plausible other players have multiple zeros. With 5 players having 8 digits each, 4 zeros is a reasonable claim. I can either bid 4 1s or higher, or 5 0s. Since I'm not confident about raising the zero count, I'll bid 4 1s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit).

Player 3 bids: 4 1s

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 40 total digits and the current bid is 4 1s, it's plausible that there are at least 4 1s. I can see that I have one 1, so the remaining players must have at least 3 more 1s. To make a higher bid, I will increase the digit to 2s while keeping the quantity the same, making it 4 2s. This is a reasonable bid as it is higher than 4 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 4 2s, which seems high given that there are only 40 digits total and 5 players. The previous bids have been aggressive, but with only one 2 in my hand, it's unlikely there are three more among the other four players. Challenging seems like the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. My hand is 57234816, which contains the digits 5, 7, 2, 3, 4, 8, 1, 6. I have one 8 and no other high-frequency digits. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative. I see that I have two even digits (2, 8, 4) that could be considered relatively common. However, starting with a low quantity and a relatively low digit seems prudent. I will bid 2 1s as it's a gentle start and 1 is a relatively common digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand, so the current bid of 2 1s is certainly met. Itâ€™s reasonable to raise the quantity to 3 1s, as there is likely at least one more 1 among the other 24 unknown digits.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Since the quantity is low, and I have a 1 in my hand, I will raise the quantity to 4 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (92372607), I only have one 1. The current bid claims there are at least 4 ones total among all players. Given the bidding history, Player 2 seems confident raising from 3 to 4 ones. However, I can see that I only have one 1, and historically players have been making relatively conservative bids. With 32 total digits remaining (8 per player Ã— 4 players), claiming 4 ones when I only see one in my hand seems risky but not impossible. Since I have a 2 in my hand, I could bid '4 2s' to stay safe, but given the previous challenge outcomes where players lost by challenging valid bids, I'll make a conservative higher bid of '4 3s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s made by Player 3. I have the digits 57234816, which means I have one 3. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 32 total digits and the current bid is 4 3s, and I have one 3, there are at least 4 threes in the game (one from each of us, and potentially more from the other players). Increasing the quantity seems risky without more information. However, I can bid the same quantity with a higher digit. My hand contains several higher digits, so bidding 4 4s or higher is reasonable. I'll choose to bid 4 4s as it's a straightforward increase in the digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one â€˜4â€™ in my hand, so there must be at least 3 more â€˜4â€™s among the other 24 cards. The probability of that is only about 43.6%, meaning a 56.4% chance the bid is false. Itâ€™s favorable to call the bluff now.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand (72). With 3 players and 24 total digits, each having 8 digits, Player 2's bid of 4 2s means there need to be 3 more 2s between the other two players. While possible, this seems unlikely given the previous bidding patterns and my knowledge of my own hand. Additionally, Player 2 has been aggressive with quantity bids in previous rounds.
