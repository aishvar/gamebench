Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have two 3s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have many high digits, increasing the quantity seems reasonable. I can bid 3 3s, which is a higher quantity than 2 3s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. Bidding 4 3s would be a lie, as there are only 4 total 3s possible across all players (8 digits each for 6 players). Bidding 3 4s would be a valid bid, increasing the digit. Bidding 4 4s would also be valid, increasing the quantity. Since I have a 4 in my hand, bidding 3 4s seems like a reasonable move. I could also consider challenging, but 3 3s is not excessively high, and I only have one 3. Therefore, I will bid 3 4s.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 74478997, which contains two 7s, two 4s, two 9s, one 8, and one additional 7. The current bid is 3 4s. I have two 4s myself, so it's likely there are at least three 4s across all hands. However, I don't have enough information to challenge yet. A safe way to increase the bid is to bid 3 7s, since I have three 7s in my hand, making it very likely. This increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which means there needs to be at least two more 7s among the other five players' hands (total of 40 digits). The probability of having at least two more 7s in the remaining digits is moderate, but not guaranteed. Since I can increase the digit to a higher number, I'll bid 3 8s, which is a safer move based on my hand (I have one 8).

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 8s' by Player 4, I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. With my hand being 92602861, I have one 8. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 players, each having 8 digits, the maximum number of any single digit across all players is 48. Since the current bid is for 3 eights and I have one 8, I must assess the likelihood of there being at least three 8s in total. Given that each player has 8 digits and there are 6 players, it's possible but not extremely likely that there are exactly three 8s or more, considering the distribution could be uneven. However, without more information about the other players' hands, it's a gamble to challenge. A safer approach might be to try and bid higher, but given the digit and quantity, the next logical bid that is strictly higher would involve either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 8 and bidding a higher quantity of 8s might be risky, I could consider bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity if I had enough information to suggest it's plausible. Since my hand doesn't provide strong evidence for a significantly higher digit being more prevalent, and challenging seems risky without a clear indication that the bid is unlikely, I must weigh these options carefully. Considering the rules and my hand, I decide to challenge the bid because the risk of bidding higher without sufficient confidence in a higher digit or quantity seems greater than the potential reward, especially given the total number of digits and the current bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 0s and one 8 in my hand. Since the current bid is None and I'm starting the bidding, I should make a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 2 0s is a safe starting point, as I already have two 0s in my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. I could bid 3 0s, or I could bid 2 of a higher number. I also have two 3s and one 1, 2, 4, and 9. Given the low bid, I will bid 3 1s to increase the quantity and digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s made by Player 0. I have 8 secret digits: 33733685. I see that I have three 1s in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 40 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. With my three 1s and the bid of 3 1s, I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to either make a valid higher bid or challenge the last bid if I think it's unlikely, I should first assess the likelihood of there being 3 or more 1s in total. Given that I alone have 3 ones, it's possible that there are indeed at least 3 ones in total. However, to make a higher bid, I could bid on a digit that I have in my hand and seems plausible given the total number of digits. I have 3 sixes, which is a significant number. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 6s requires either increasing the quantity to 5 or more, or keeping the quantity at 4 and increasing the digit to 7 or higher. Increasing the quantity to 5 seems risky given I only have one 6. Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable option as I have one 7. However, given the previous history of challenges and eliminations, and the relatively low total digit count remaining (40), a challenge seems more strategic. 4 6s seems a bit high given the limited total digits, and I'm willing to risk a challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: It's the start of a new round with 32 total digits remaining. The previous rounds saw some high bids being challenged successfully. I have one 6 in my hand. Player 0 bid 2 3s, Player 4 bid 2 0s, and Player 0 bid 3 1s in the previous round. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable, as it's a higher digit than the previous bids and a plausible quantity given my hand. It's not overly aggressive, but it establishes a starting point.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 74478997, which contains three 7s, two 4s, two 9s, and one 8. The current bid is 3 6s. I have no 6s in my hand, but it's plausible that there are three 6s among the remaining 24 digits held by the other three players. Challenging now would be risky, as three 6s is a reasonable bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the digit to 7 (since I have three 7s), keeping the quantity the same. This is a safe and logical move based on my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which means there needs to be at least two more 7s among the other three players (total of 24 digits). Given that 7s are relatively rare and the previous bid was 3 6s, it's plausible but not certain. However, with only one 7 in my hand, I'm not confident enough to challenge. Instead, I'll increase the digit to 8, which I also have one of, making the bid 3 8s.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Since the total number of digits is now 32, it is not unreasonable that there are at least 3 eights. I don't want to challenge without more information. I can bid 4 0s, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 5 0s would be a reasonable bluff, as it's a small increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 4s (one 4) or 6s (one 6). However, given the previous rounds, players seem willing to bid high. Increasing the quantity of 0s seems like the safest option to stay in the game without revealing too much about my hand. Bidding 5 0s is the lowest increase possible while still being a valid bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. In my hand (74478997), I have zero 0s. With 32 digits in play and knowing that 0s are generally less common, the probability of there being at least 5 zeros among the remaining 24 digits (which I cannot see) is relatively low. Previous rounds also saw low zero counts. Given this, I believe it's unlikely there are 5 or more 0s in total, so I will challenge.

Given the limited number of digits remaining (24 total), and the history of previous rounds, I should make a conservative bid. Bidding 2 1s is a reasonable starting point, as I have one 1 in my hand and it's a low digit. Since it's the beginning of the round, a low bid is less likely to be challenged immediately.
