Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with no bids yet. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 84645032, which contains a variety of digits. I have two 4s and no other digit appears more than twice. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but not too low. Bidding on a digit that appears relatively frequently in my hand seems logical. I will bid on 4s, as I have two of them. A quantity of 8 seems like a reasonable starting point, considering there are 6 players and 48 digits in total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total), and Player 0 claiming there are at least 8 fours, this seems plausible but risky. Given my hand only has one 4, for the bid to be true, there would need to be 7 more 4s among the other 40 digits (about 17.5% of remaining digits). While possible, it's slightly above the expected random distribution. However, since it's the first bid and relatively conservative, challenging might be too aggressive. I'll make a safer bid by increasing to 8 5s, maintaining the same quantity but increasing the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 5s made by Player 1. I have 8 secret digits in my hand: 14020028. I can see that I have two 2s, two 0s, one 1, one 4, one 8, and one 6. I do not have any 5s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 5s, I will bid on a digit that I have in my hand. Bidding 2 8s seems reasonable as it's higher in digit compared to 5s and I have one 8 in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 5s made by Player 1. I have 2 fives in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have a high quantity of any single digit, I should aim to increase the digit. Bidding 8 6s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit than 5, and I'm not overestimating the total count.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:2 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 37078992, which contains no 6s. The current bid is 8 6s by Player 2. With 48 total digits across 6 players, an average of 4.8 digits per digit value (0-9) is expected. A bid of 8 6s is significantly above average, suggesting it might be a bluff. Since I have no 6s myself, the likelihood of there being 8 or more 6s in the remaining 40 digits seems low, though not impossible. However, bidding higher, such as 9 6s or 8 7s, feels risky given I have only two 7s and no 6s to support the bid. I believe challenging the current bid of 8 6s offers a reasonable chance of success, as the bid appears aggressive for this stage of the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet in this round and I am starting the bidding, I need to make a reasonable opening bid based on my hand. My hand is 37078992, which gives me digits with counts: two 9s, two 7s, and one each of 3, 0, 8, and 2. With 5 players and 40 total digits, an average count for any digit across all hands would be around 4. I have two 9s, which is a decent starting point. Bidding 5 9s seems plausible as it assumes only 3 more 9s among the other 32 digits, which is statistically reasonable. This bid also uses a high digit, making it harder for others to outbid without increasing quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, leaving 32 unknown digits. With a 10% chance per digit, the expected number of 9s among them is 3.2, so total expected 9s is about 4.2. The probability of there being at least 5 9s is well under 50%, making this bid unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With 24 unknown digits among the other players, the chance of at least one more 6 is high (~92%), making 3 6s a reasonable and safe opening bid with only 4 players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s, and I hold the digits 1, 5, 2, 5, 6, 5, 3, 7. I have one 6, so the total count of 6s across all players is at most 1. Bidding higher than 3 6s (e.g., 4 6s) is unlikely to be true, and the previous bids suggest players are cautious after the challenge. Challenging the 3 6s bid seems safe since I know my hand contains only one 6, making it impossible for there to be at least 4 sixes overall.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s means only one more 6 among the other 16 unknown digits, which is quite plausible (~82% chance). Starting with 3 6s gives me a reasonable bid that’s hard to challenge immediately.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (84645032). Considering there are 24 digits in total and 16 digits from other players, it's possible that the total count of 6s is at least 3. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I see one 6 in my hand, bidding 3 7s seems reasonable as it increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand (7,7). With 24 total digits and 3 players, the current bid of '3 7s' is quite reasonable. Since I already know about two 7s, Player 0 likely has at least one 7 to make such a bid. I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 8, which is a higher digit. Bidding '3 8s' would be a safe increase, maintaining the same quantity but using a higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. For the bid of 3 8s to be true, at least two of the 16 unknown digits must be 8s. The probability of at least two 8s in 16 random digits is under 50%, so it’s more likely the bid is false. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 and two 7s in my hand. With 16 total digits in play (8 digits per player), and this being the first bid of the round, I should make a conservative opening bid. Since I have two 7s, bidding 3 7s is reasonable as it only requires Player 0 to have one more 7 to be valid. This is a safe starting bid that builds on my known cards.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have the hand 84645032, which contains one 7. So, the total count of 7s across both hands is at least 1 (mine) plus some unknown number from Player 1's hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't know Player 1's hand, I'll consider the minimum count of 7s to be 1 (my 7) and potentially more if Player 1 has 7s. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid. However, I should also assess the likelihood of the bid being true. Given that I have one 7 and there are 16 digits in total, bidding 4 7s might be too high if Player 1 doesn't have many 7s. Thus, bidding 3 8s is a safer increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand (position 0). The current bid of 3 8s by Player 0 means they need to have at least 2 more 8s in their hand for their bid to be valid. While possible, this seems unlikely given that they would be claiming to have multiple 8s. Additionally, from the game history, we've seen relatively conservative bids, and players who made aggressive bids often got challenged. Since I know I only have one 8, and Player 0 would need at least 2 more 8s for their bid to be true, challenging seems like the safer option.
