Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder with the hand 34726728, I have two 2s and two 7s. The total number of digits is 48 across 6 players, making the statistical average count for any digit 4.8. My hand contains two 2s. Bidding '4 2s' is a reasonable opening bid. It leverages the information from my hand (having two 2s) and assumes there are at least two more 2s among the remaining 40 digits held by other players, which is statistically likely and slightly below the overall average expectation. This sets a credible baseline for the round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have zero 2s in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8. A bid of 4 2s is plausible, but I have no 2s to support it. Bidding higher on 2s is risky. I have three 5s in my hand. Bidding on 5s seems like a better strategy. I can bid 5 5s, which is a higher quantity and digit than 4 2s, and is supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s made by Player 1. I have the digits 0, 4, 7, 6, 9, 6, 9 in my hand, which includes two 6s and two 9s, but no 5s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 5s, I will bid on a digit that I have in my hand. Bidding 2 6s seems reasonable as it's a conservative increase in quantity and utilizes the information from my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s made by Player 1. I have two 5s and two 6s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have a total of 8 digits and there are 48 total digits remaining, bidding a high quantity of a higher digit seems reasonable. I will bid 6 6s, increasing both the quantity and the digit based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have the digits 1, 6, 3, 4, 7, 8, 7, 3 in my hand, which means I have only one 6. Since the total number of 6s across all players is at least 6, and I only have one 6, it's unlikely that the total is actually 6 or more. Challenging now could reveal the truth and eliminate the previous bidder if they overbid. Given the low likelihood of there being 6 or more 6s, I will challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is None, meaning I can make any initial bid. I have two 6s and one 9 in my hand. Since there are 5 active players with 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in total. Making a bid of 2 9s seems conservative and reasonable given my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. Player 2's bid of 2 9s seems plausible, but I can improve it by bidding a higher quantity or digit. Since I have no other 9s, I'll increase the quantity.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, so I must raise the quantity to at least 4. Bidding 4 5s leverages my two known 5s and aligns with the expected total of about four 5s in 40 digits, making this a plausible and safe raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. The expected average count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. So, 4 5s is statistically average. However, my hand (34726728) contains zero 5s. This means the other 32 digits must contain at least four 5s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 5s in those 32 digits is 3.2, making the bid slightly less likely, but not necessarily worth a challenge this early. I have two 7s in my hand. The expected number of 7s across all hands, given my two 7s, is 2 (my hand) + (32 digits / 10) = 2 + 3.2 = 5.2. Therefore, bidding 5 7s is statistically supported by my hand, increases the quantity significantly, and puts pressure on the next player.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:4 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains three 5s, one 9, one 3, one 6, one 0, and one 8. The current bid is 5 7s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are a total of 40 digits.  A bid of 5 7s means Player 0 believes there are at least five 7s among the 40 digits.  The average number of any digit is 40/10 = 4.  5 7s is slightly above average but not outrageously high.  I have three 5s in my hand. The previous bid was 4 5s, which I could have beaten with 5 5s. However, the current bid is 5 7s. I can make a higher bid than 5 7s. Bidding 6 of any digit is a significant jump. Bidding 5 of a higher digit is also an option. Given I have three 5s, a bid of 6 5s seems like a reasonable increase, using the strength in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s made by Player 1. I have the hand 04976969, which contains two 5s and two 6s, and three 9s. Given that my hand has two 5s, and there are 4 other players, the total count of 5s could reasonably be higher than 6. However, I also notice that I can bid higher than 6 5s with a reasonable chance of success. Bidding 7 6s seems risky but could be viable given my two 6s. However, I should consider if challenging is more beneficial given the high bid and the distribution of digits.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s made by Player 2. I have two 6s in my hand, which is more than the quantity in the current bid. I can make a valid higher bid by increasing the quantity to 3 and keeping the same digit, as it's a more conservative approach given my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have zero 6s in my hand. For the bid of 8 6s to be true, there must be at least 8 of the 32 unknown digits as 6s (expected ~3.2, probability of â‰¥8 is only ~1%). That seems extremely unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. With 32 total digits, there should be about 3.2 ones on average, so itâ€™s plausible there are at least two more among the other players, making at least four 1s in total. Opening with 4 1s is a strong yet reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. There are 32 total digits among 4 players. The expected number of any digit is 3.2 (32/10). The bid of 4 is slightly above average, but plausible. I have zero 1s in my hand (34726728), which slightly increases the chance the bid is a bluff, but challenging is still risky as only 4 are needed from the other 24 digits. I have two 2s and two 7s. Bidding 4 2s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This seems like a safe and reasonable step, as it only requires two more 2s among the other 24 digits (less than the expected 2.4), leverages my hand, and passes the decision to the next player without significantly escalating the bid quantity.

Player 1 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round with 16 total digits between two players. My hand is 59553608. I have three 5s, one 9, one 3, one 6, one 0, and one 8. A safe starting bid is usually around the number of a digit you have in your hand, or slightly more if you feel confident.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s made by Player 1. There are 16 total digits between Player 1 and myself. My hand (34726728) contains zero 5s. Therefore, for Player 1's bid to be accurate, Player 1 must hold at least four 5s in their 8-digit hand. While Player 1 has won previous challenges involving 5s, requiring 4 out of 8 digits to be 5s is a high concentration. Instead of challenging this potentially strong claim, I can make a relatively safe higher bid based on my hand. I have two 7s. Bidding 4 7s requires a total of four 7s across both hands. This means Player 1 only needs to have two 7s for my bid to be potentially true, which is statistically more likely than Player 1 holding four 5s. This bid is higher than 4 5s (same quantity, higher digit) and utilizes the strength of my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. With 16 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 1.6 (16 / 10). A bid of 4 7s is significantly higher than the expected count. While it's possible the other player has three 7s, challenging seems like a reasonable move given the low probability, especially since Player 0 just increased the digit from 5s to 7s at the same quantity.
