Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. With 40 unknown digits and an expected 4 fives among them, the total expected count is about 6. Opening with 4 5s is a conservative, high‐probability bid to start the round.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s made by Player 0. I have one 5 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 5, increasing the quantity to 5 or more seems risky without knowing others' hands. I can bid on a higher digit that I have. I have two 6s, so bidding 2 6s is a conservative and safe move as it increases the digit and is based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have many high digits, increasing the quantity seems risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding a higher digit with a low quantity could be a strategy. I have one 6 in my hand, so bidding 2 6s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit than 5 and I have some 6s to back it up.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 3/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have two 5s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll increase the digit slightly. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit and I have one 6 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Challenging this bid seems risky, as it's possible that other players have 6s. However, bidding higher on 6s is not feasible without more information. I need to bid on a digit I have more of. I have one 9 in my hand. If I bid 4 7s, it's a reasonable increase in digit, and if someone challenges, I can potentially win if the actual count of 7s is less than 4. I will bid 4 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand has no 7s, and the expected number of 7s in the remaining 40 digits is 4. Challenging here has a ~43% chance of success if the actual count is <4. While risky, this is a reasonable opportunity to eliminate the bidder if the count is slightly below expectation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 9, one 0, one 5, one 4, one 7, and one 3 in my hand. Player 0 bid 4 5s, Player 1 bid 4 6s, and the last bid of 4 7s was challenged and won. Since 4 7s was valid, it's likely there are at least 4 of some digit in play. I have a 9, so I'll bid 4 9s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, and I need to bid higher. My hand contains only one 9, so I cannot confidently claim more than one 9 across all players. Bidding 5 9s is impossible given my hand and the maximum total of 40 digits. The only logical move is to challenge the current bid, as it's unlikely that there are at least 4 9s in total.

Player 4(Orig:3 - gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14) challenges Player 2(Orig:2 - mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor)'s bid of 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: With the current bid being 'None', I need to make a bid that is higher. I have one 9 in my hand. Given the previous successful bids of 4 7s and 4 9s, it's reasonable to believe that there are at least 4 of another digit among the players. I should bid on a digit I have, to increase the likelihood of winning if challenged. Bidding 5 0s seems like a good move since it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to potential lower bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. I could challenge, but it's possible there are five 0s out there. I could bid higher. I have three 8s in my hand. Bidding 6 8s seems like a reasonable increase and plays to my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have only one 8 in my hand. With 24 unknown digits among the other players, we’d expect about 2.4 more 8s for a total around 3.4. A bid of 6 8s is highly improbable, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. Since there is no current bid, I can make an opening bid. Bidding 3 8s seems like a reasonable starting point, reflecting my hand's contents.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 5. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that there are only 24 total digits remaining and 3 active players, the maximum possible count for any digit is 24. The bid of 3 8s seems plausible but not extremely high. However, I do not have enough information about the other players' hands to be certain. I should bid higher to try and win without challenging, as challenging could result in my loss if the count is indeed 3 or more 8s. I will bid 4 8s to increase the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my turn to bid. I have the hand 88539196, which contains two 8s and one 9. Since I need to make a bid that is valid and higher than 'None', I can start with a low quantity and digit based on my hand. Bidding 2 8s seems reasonable as it's a conservative bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 5. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players with 8 digits each, the maximum possible count for any digit is 16. I have a relatively high digit in my hand and the current bid seems plausible but I need to be strategic. I can try to make a higher bid or challenge. Since I have one 8, and assuming Player 5 might have at least one 8 as well, bidding higher seems reasonable. I will bid 4 8s as it is a straightforward increase in quantity.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s. Since there are only 16 total digits, and I hold three 8s, there could be as few as four 8s total or as many as 11 total. A bid of 5 8s is a safe increase. Bidding higher than that starts to get risky.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s made by Player 5. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. A bid of 5 8s seems unlikely but not impossible. However, I do not have enough information to confidently challenge. I will bid 6 8s to increase the quantity, as my goal is to either make a valid higher bid or challenge if I think the bid is unlikely.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 8s made by Player 5. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and each player has 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit across both players is 16. With my hand being 88539196, I have two 8s. For Player 5 to have 7 8s, they must have five 8s, which seems highly unlikely given that I already have two 8s and there are only 16 digits in total. Therefore, I should challenge this bid.
