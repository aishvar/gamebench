Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no bids yet, I can start with a reasonable bid. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 4 5s is a safe starting point, as it's likely there are at least four 5s among all players' hands.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 35330736. I have one 5. The current bid is 4 5s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. A bid of 4 5s is somewhat high, but not impossible.  I have multiple 3s (four), which is a strong digit for me. Bidding on 3s is a good strategy. I can bid 5 3s, which is a higher quantity than the current bid of 4 5s and is based on my strong hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s made by Player 1. I have the digits 9, 8, 2, 7, 4, 6, 5, 1 in my hand, which includes one 5 and no 3s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 3s, I should focus on bidding a digit that I have in my hand. Bidding 2 5s seems reasonable as it's higher than 5 3s in terms of digit value and I have one 5 in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s made by Player 1. My hand contains one 3. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 3, increasing the quantity to 6 or more would be risky without knowing other players' hands. However, I can increase the digit. Bidding 5 4s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit than 3, and I have a 4 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 5 4s. Bidding 5 5s increases the digit while maintaining the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 5s and raises the bar for the required count, making it more challenging for opponents to defend if challenged later.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have zero 5s in my hand. While challenging is an option, the bid is only slightly above the expected value for the remaining players, and Player 3 might have support for it. My hand contains two 7s. Bidding 5 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). To meet this bid, we need 3 more 7s among the remaining 40 digits held by other players. The expected number of 7s in 40 digits is 4, and the probability of getting at least 3 is high. This makes 5 7s a well-supported and relatively safe bid based on my hand and probability, allowing me to pass the turn.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 7s, I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since I have no 7s in my hand (62783200) and considering the digit 7 is relatively high, bidding a higher quantity of 7s seems risky. However, I can try to bid a higher quantity of a lower digit or the same quantity of a higher digit. Given that I have two 8s and no other digit appears more than twice in my hand, bidding the same quantity of a higher digit than 7 is not possible since 7 is the second-highest digit. Thus, my best option is to increase the quantity while considering the distribution of digits. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48 and we're already at a bid of 5 7s, increasing the quantity to 6 for any digit seems like a safer bet than challenging directly, especially considering I have no insight into other players' hands. Given my hand and the need to increase the bid, I'll choose a digit that appears in my hand and attempt to increase the quantity, keeping in mind the total number of digits remaining and the bids made so far.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, and the current bid is 6 2s. Since I have no 2s, challenging seems risky. However, I noticed that no one has bid on the digit 9 yet, and I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 7 9s is a reasonable move, increasing both the quantity and the digit, and it's likely to be higher than the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 35330736. I have four 3s, one 5, one 0, one 7, and one 6. The current bid is 7 9s.  I have zero 9s. A bid of 7 9s is quite high with 6 players and 48 digits total.  On average, we'd expect around 4.8 of any given digit (48 total digits / 10 possible digits). Seven 9s is significantly above average.  However, challenging is risky if Player 0 actually has a lot of 9s or if other players have a few.  Looking at the previous bids, Player 0 started with 4 5s, then Player 1 (me) bid 5 3s (based on my four 3s), and the bids have steadily increased.  Player 0's jump to 7 9s is a significant increase.  While it's possible, it feels like a high bid. Given my hand has no 9s, and the bid is high, challenging seems reasonable.  I don't have a strong hand to make a significantly higher bid that I'm confident in.

Player 1 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this new round. I have four 3s in my hand (3, 3, 3, 3). With 40 total digits among 5 players, the average count for any digit is 4. Bidding 5 3s is a safe and reasonable starting bid based on my strong hand in 3s.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s made by Player 1. I have the digit 3 in my hand, which is relevant to the current bid. However, I also need to consider the likelihood of there being at least 5 3s in total. Given that there are 5 players and each has 8 digits, there are 40 digits in total. I have one 3, so there are 39 digits left. If I bid higher than 5 3s, I should consider increasing either the quantity or the digit. Since I have a 3 and other high digits, bidding 6 3s seems reasonable but risky. I should also consider the distribution of other digits. Alternatively, challenging seems tempting because 5 3s might be hard to verify given the total number of digits and hands. However, without exact information on other players' hands, I must make an educated guess. I will choose to bid higher with a moderate increase.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have no 3s in my hand, and the current bid is 6 3s. The average expected count of any digit in 40 total digits is 4, making 6 a relatively high bid. Without any 3s myself, it's plausible the actual count is below 6. Challenging is a reasonable risk to eliminate the bidder if the bid is false.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my turn as Player 2. I have the digits 9, 8, 2, 7, 4, 6, 5, 1 in my hand. I should make a conservative bid to start, considering the total digits remaining and my own hand. I have one 7, and bidding 1 7s seems reasonable as a starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid of 1 7s is very low and almost certainly true, making a challenge unwise. My hand contains two 7s, guaranteeing the total count is at least 2. With 32 total digits remaining, the average count for any digit is 3.2. Bidding 3 7s requires only one additional 7 from the remaining 24 digits held by other players, which is a highly probable outcome (approximately 92% likely). This bid is a significant step up from 1 7s, leveraging my hand strength in 7s, and is likely true, putting pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 7s and my hand of 62783200, I notice I don't have any 7s. However, considering the total digits remaining is 32 and there are 4 players, the maximum number of any digit can be 32. Since I don't have any 7s and the bid is for 3 7s, which seems relatively low, I should consider the possibility of challenging. But, I must also think about making a higher bid. Since my hand contains two 6s and the current bid is for 7s, bidding on 6s could be an option. However, I need to bid higher than 3 7s. Bidding on a higher digit than 7 is not possible since 7 is the highest digit in the current bid, so I must increase the quantity. Given my two 6s, bidding 4 6s could be reasonable, as it's higher than the current bid and I have some basis for it in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 35330736, containing four 3s, one 5, one 0, one 7, and one 6. The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. With 4 players and 8 digits each, the expected number of 6s is around 3.2 (32 total digits / 10 possible digits). The bid of 4 6s is slightly above the expected value. Given I only have one 6, and the previous bid was on 7s, bidding 4 6s seems plausible for Player 5.  I have four 3s, which is a strong holding. Bidding on 3s is a good option. A bid of 5 3s is a valid increase over 4 6s (same quantity, higher digit). With four 3s in my hand, it's highly likely there are at least 5 3s in total among the 32 digits. Bidding 5 3s is a safe and strategic move.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s made by Player 1. I have the digits 9, 8, 2, 7, 4, 6, 5, 1 in my hand, which means I have one 3 and other digits but no additional 3s to contribute much to the count. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 4 active players with 8 digits each (total of 32 digits), bidding a high quantity seems risky without strong evidence. However, I can see that bidding a higher digit with a reasonable quantity might be a safer strategy. Since I have one 3, I can try to bid higher with a different digit. I will bid 2 6s as my hand contains a 6 and it's a way to increase the digit value.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s made by Player 1. I have a 3 in my hand. Given that there are 4 active players and each has 8 secret digits, there are 32 digits in total. The bid of 5 3s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. My hand contains one 3, and without information on others' hands, I must consider the likelihood and potential counts. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should consider if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s by Player 2. While this is a high bid relative to the total number of digits (32), Player 2 successfully defended a bid of 6 3s in the previous round when there were 40 digits. This suggests they might have a strong hand or read on 3s, making a challenge risky despite the reduced total digits. My hand contains two 7s. Bidding 6 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is plausible given I hold two of that digit, requiring only 4 more 7s among the remaining 24 digits. This seems like a safer and more strategic move than challenging Player 2's potentially strong or well-bluffed bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 6 7s by Player 4, I must decide whether to bid higher or challenge. With my hand being 62783200, I have one 7, which is a relatively low contribution to the total count of 7s. Considering the total digits remaining are 32 and there are 4 active players, each having 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 32. Since the current bid is for 6 7s, and given that I only have one 7, I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 6 7s in total. Given that my contribution is minimal and without knowledge of other players' hands, the bid seems somewhat high but not impossible. However, since I need to make a strictly higher bid, and considering the constraints, bidding on a higher digit or increasing the quantity further seems risky without more information. Challenging the current bid might be a safer option, but since my hand does contain a 7, it slightly increases the credibility of the bid. Nonetheless, the lack of higher digits in my hand to base a new bid on, coupled with the risk of overbidding, makes challenging a more strategic choice, especially considering the potential for the current bid to be an overestimation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 62783200, I see that I have multiple occurrences of the digit '2' and other digits. Since I have to make a bid that is strictly higher than 'None', I should start with a quantity and digit that seems reasonable based on my hand. I notice I have two '2's, but since the bid must be for the total count across all players, starting with a lower quantity for a higher digit might be safer. However, considering my hand and the fact that we are starting fresh with no previous bids to gauge, bidding on a digit I have the most of could be a good strategy. Given that I have two '2's and considering the total number of digits remaining is 24, bidding on '2's or another digit I have could be a good starting point. Since my hand contains two '2's and no other digit appears more than twice, starting with a bid of '2 2s' seems too low given the total possible count. I should aim for a digit that balances between being high enough to be competitive and low enough to be plausible. Considering the distribution and aiming to balance risk, I could consider bidding on a digit like '6' since I have one and it's relatively high, or play safer with the '2's. However, given that I need to make a bid and 'None' is the current bid, I should consider what would be a reasonable starting point for the round, taking into account the need to balance between making a bid that is achievable and one that challenges other players. Given these considerations and looking to make a balanced start, I decide to bid on a digit that I have and seems like a reasonable starting point.

Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 3s and my hand containing 62783200, I notice I have no 3s. Considering the total digits remaining is 24 and there are only 3 active players, each with 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 24. Since the current bid is 5 3s, to make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Given my hand, I have two 6s and two 7s, but bidding on these might be risky without knowing the other players' hands. However, since I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than 5 3s, and considering the distribution of my hand, I could consider bidding on a digit I have, but I must be cautious. Challenging the bid seems like a viable option if I think the bid is unlikely, but given I don't have any 3s, it's hard to assess the likelihood without more information. Since my hand has two 6s and the current bid is on 3s, making a bid on 6s could be reasonable, considering it increases the digit value, which is a valid way to make a higher bid. However, the quantity of 5 is already somewhat high given the total number of digits remaining, so increasing the quantity further might be risky. Given these considerations, a balanced approach would be to increase the digit while keeping the quantity manageable, but since I must strictly increase the bid, and given the constraints, challenging might be safer if the current bid seems too high, which it does given the information and the fact that we've just started a new round with fewer players and thus fewer total digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have four 3s in my hand. The current bid is 2 3s. Since I have four 3s, I know there are at least four 3s in total. Bidding 4 3s is a safe and higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s made by Player 1. I have the hand 98274651, which contains two 3s. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and both players have 8 digits, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. Since Player 1's bid of 4 3s seems plausible but I do not have enough information to be certain, I should consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. My hand has two 3s, and I can see if I can make a bid that is higher than 4 3s. Bidding 5 3s would be higher in quantity and I have two 3s to support this. However, I should also consider if challenging could be more beneficial if I think the bid is unlikely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have four 3s in my hand. With two players and a total of 16 digits, the average count for any digit is 1.6.  A bid of 5 3s means Player 2 thinks there are at least five 3s between us. Since I have four, Player 2 would only need one more 3. This is a reasonable bid given my hand, but it's also possible they are bluffing.  However, challenging 5 3s when I hold four is risky; if Player 2 has even one 3, they win.  Bidding higher is the safer option.  Given I have four 3s, bidding 6 3s is a plausible next bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s made by Player 1. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and each player has 8 digits, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. I have the digits 9, 8, 2, 7, 4, 6, 5, 1 in my hand. I see that there are already 6 3s bid and I do not have any 3s in my hand. I should challenge this bid because it seems unlikely that there are 6 3s in total.
