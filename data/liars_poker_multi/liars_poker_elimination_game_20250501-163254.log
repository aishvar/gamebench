Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8, one 9, one 0, two 1s, one 3, one 5, and one 4 in my hand. Since the current bid is None and I'm starting the bidding, I should make a conservative bid based on my hand. A bid of 2 1s is reasonable as I have two 1s in my hand, and it's likely other players have at least one more 1.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '2 1s' by Player 0, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have 86325359 in my hand, which contains no 1s, I don't have direct information to challenge the bid based on my hand alone. However, considering the total number of digits remaining (48) and the fact that each player has 8 digits, the bid of '2 1s' seems relatively low. To make a higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or the digit. Given that I don't have any 1s, and increasing the quantity to 3 for any digit I have could be risky without knowing the distribution of digits among other players, I should consider bidding on a digit I have, ensuring the quantity is higher than 2 or the digit is higher than 1 if the quantity remains the same. Since my hand contains two 3s, bidding '2 3s' would be a safe increase in digit value, keeping the quantity the same as the current bid but moving to a higher digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have one 4 in my hand, but I can bid 2 5s, which is a higher digit than 4, maintaining the same quantity. This is a valid higher bid and leverages the possibility that other players might have 5s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits: 11192105. I see that I have one 5 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my goal is to make a strictly higher bid, I can increase the quantity to 3 or higher with the same digit, or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. Given that I have a 5 and it's a relatively low digit, bidding 3 5s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid with a higher digit that I have in my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 6s and two 9s in my hand. Player 4 bid 3 5s. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable next step, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This bid is likely to be valid given the digits in my hand and the previous bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which means there needs to be at least two more 6s among the other five players. Given that the bid has already increased from 2 5s to 3 5s and then to 3 6s, it's possible that other players have 6s as well. However, bidding 4 6s seems too aggressive, and challenging now might be premature. A safer move would be to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 7s' and my hand '86325359', I notice I have one 7 and one 8. Considering the bidding history, players have been increasing either the quantity or the digit. Since I have a higher digit in my hand (8) and only one 7, I can try to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, as increasing the quantity might be risky without knowing the exact distribution of digits among other players. Thus, bidding '3 8s' seems like a reasonable move, as it increases the digit from 7 to 8, keeping the quantity at 3, which is a logical progression based on the game's history and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand, and the total digits across all players are 48. The average number of 9s per player is 0.8, making 3 9s plausible but not certain. However, challenging the bid could eliminate Player 2 if the actual count is less than 3. Given the uncertainty and my lack of 9s, challenging is a strategic risk to test the validity of the bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 4s, two 6s, and one 9 in my hand. Player 4 bid 2 0s. I could bid 3 0s, but that seems risky. I could also bid 3 4s, but that's only a slight increase in digit. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable increase in digit and quantity, based on my hand and the previous bids. However, challenging might be the best option. Player 4's bid of 2 0s seems reasonable, but given the history and the digits in my hand, challenging could be a good move as well. Ultimately, I will bid 3 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which seems plausible given the previous round's outcome where 3 9s were challenged and the actual count was 5. However, with only one 6 in my hand and 4 other players, it's possible that the total count is at least 3. To stay in the game, I can make a safe bid by increasing the digit to 7, which I also have one of in my hand. This maintains the quantity but increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Player 0 bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 7s' and my hand '86325359', I notice that I have one 7 and one 8, but no 9s. Since the current bid is '3 7s', to make a higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. However, considering the total digits remaining (40) and the fact that I only have one 7 and one 8, bidding on a higher quantity of 7s or any 8s seems risky without more information about other players' hands. Given the bidding history, players have been cautious with their bids, and the last challenge resulted in the bidder winning with an actual count of 5 for the digit 9, which was higher than the bid. This indicates that players might have more of the higher digits than initially thought. Since I don't have enough information to safely increase the quantity for 7s or move to 8s, and considering the game's progression and the fact that challenging could provide insight or eliminate a player if the bid is unlikely, I should consider challenging the current bid if it seems improbable. However, with one 7 in my hand and the potential for other players to have 7s, challenging '3 7s' might not be the best strategy unless I had a stronger reason to believe the bid is unlikely. Given these considerations and aiming to make a strategic move, I should look for a balance between the risk of challenging and the potential of making a higher bid. Since my hand contains a 6 and the previous bid of '3 6s' was made by Player 5, indicating some presence of 6s, and considering I need to make a strictly higher bid than '3 7s', I could consider bidding on a higher digit or increasing the quantity if I had more confidence in the distribution of digits. However, without clear evidence of a higher digit's abundance and given the total remaining digits, my best strategic move, considering the need for a higher bid and the information available, would be to carefully assess the likelihood of the current bid being true and decide based on that assessment. Given that I have one 8 and no 9s, and considering the bids made so far, it seems plausible that there could be at least three 7s among the players, especially since the game has just started with 5 players and 40 digits. Thus, challenging might be risky without stronger evidence against the bid. Therefore, my action should be to make a bid that is strategically sound given the information and the game's state.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s made by Player 2. I have one 1 in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 secret digits, there are a total of 40 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Since I have to make a bid strictly higher than 4 1s, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 5 1s seems risky since I only have one 1. A safer bet would be to bid on a higher digit that I have in my hand. I have one 5, and bidding 4 5s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and matches the quantity.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have two 6s and two 9s in my hand. Given the bidding history, it's likely that there are at least 4 6s or 4 9s among all players. Bidding 4 6s or 4 9s seems reasonable as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. However, challenging might be risky since we don't have enough information to confidently dispute the 4 5s bid. Therefore, I will bid 4 6s.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (from 89031054). The current bid is 4 6s, which means there are at least 4 sixes across all players' hands. Given that there are 5 players left, each with 8 digits, the total digits are 40. The previous bid was 4 5s, and the current bid is 4 6s, which is a higher digit but same quantity. Since I only have one 6, and the bid is already at 4, it's unlikely that there are 4 sixes in total. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.
