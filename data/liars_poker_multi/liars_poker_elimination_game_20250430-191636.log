Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I can start by bidding a relatively low but safe bid to establish a baseline. I have two 0s, two 6s, and one 4 in my hand, so I know I have at least two 0s and two 6s. Starting with a modest bid like '1 0s' or '1 6s' seems reasonable. Given I have more 6s (two) than 0s (one), bidding '1 6s' might be slightly more aggressive but still safe and informative. I'll choose to bid '1 6s' to challenge others to bid higher or challenge me if they think it's unlikely.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, which supports the bid being reasonable or even conservative. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have two 6s, I can confidently bid higher than 1 6s. Bidding 2 6s is a safe increase in quantity.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 0s in my hand. The current bid is only 2 6s, which is almost certainly true. By bidding 3 0s, I guarantee two zeros myself and only need one more among the other 40 cards (a >98% probability), and I also increase the quantity, making it harder for opponents to stay at 3.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 0s' and considering my hand '33612354', I notice I have one '0'. Since the bid is relatively low and we are early in the game, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same or increasing the digit with the same quantity could be viable strategies. However, with my hand containing no digits that are extremely abundant (except for '3' which appears twice), and considering the total number of digits remaining is 48, bidding on a digit I have more of seems prudent. Given that '3' appears twice in my hand and it's a higher digit than '0', I can attempt to increase the digit value while keeping the quantity the same as the current bid, thus making a bid of '3 3s'. This strategy leverages my knowledge of my hand to make an informed bid that is higher than the current bid '3 0s' by digit value.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one 3 in my hand and several 7s, but the bid is on 3s. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit. Since 3 3s was last bid, I can bid 3 4s or higher. I have no 4s, but 3 4s is a small increase and likely plausible. Alternatively, I could increase quantity to 4 with any digit. Given the current bid and my hand, bidding 3 4s is a reasonable next step.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s, which I cannot support since I have no 4s. Bidding 4 1s is a safer move because 1s are common digits, and with my three 1s, it's plausible there are at least four in total across all players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s, meaning there are at least four '1's in all players' hands. I have no '1's in my hand, so I cannot support or surpass this bid. The total number of digits is 48, and with no '1's in my hand, the maximum total '1's possible is 4 (if all other players have at least one '1'). Since the bid is for 4 '1's, it's at the limit. Challenging now would be risky because if the total '1's are indeed 4 or more, I lose; if fewer, I win. But given I have zero '1's, the total can't be more than the sum of other players' '1's. The previous bids for other digits (like 6s, 0s, 3s, 4s) don't directly impact the '1's count. Since I believe the total '1's can't reach 4, challenging seems appropriate.

Player 5 Reasoning: As the starting player, I need to make the first bid. My hand contains three 1s, so bidding 4 1s is reasonable, as it only requires one additional 1 from the other players' hands. This is a conservative bid based on my own holdings and the total number of digits remaining.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand (95266027). With 4 players remaining besides me, and assuming an even distribution, it's plausible that there are 4 ones in total. However, I can try to bid higher to put pressure on others. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since increasing the quantity to 5 might be too aggressive given the information, I can bid the same quantity with a higher digit. The next higher digit is 2, but I should check if it's reasonable. I have two 2s, and it's likely others have 2s as well. Bidding 4 2s is a reasonable step as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, making it a slightly more challenging bid for others to meet or exceed.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand, so the current bid of 4 2s requires three of the 32 unknown digits to be 2s (about a 66% chance). I also have one 5, so a minimal valid raise to 4 5s requires three of the unknown digits to be 5s, with similar odds, and keeps the bid as low as possible to discourage challenge. Therefore I'll bid 4 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 5s' by Player 2, I must decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. My hand contains the digits 33612354. Since I have one 5 in my hand and considering the distribution of digits might not be even, bidding higher on 5s could be risky without more information. However, I notice that I have two 3s and two 6s in my hand, suggesting that bidding on these digits could be promising if I think others might also have them. Given that the current bid is on 5s and I only have one, I'll consider increasing the quantity or changing the digit to something I have more of or think is more likely to appear in others' hands. Since my hand has multiple 3s and 6s, and given that 6 is a higher digit than 5, I could bid on 6s to increase both the quantity and the digit, leveraging my hand's composition for a strategic advantage.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 7 in my hand and multiple 7s, but no 6s. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 5 and increase the digit. Bidding 5 7s is reasonable since I have four 7s in my hand, making it more plausible. Increasing the quantity to 6 with any digit would be riskier without stronger evidence.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have no 7s in my hand (25111896). With 40 total digits across 5 players, the expected number of 7s is 4 (40 * 0.1). Bidding 5 7s exceeds this average. Since I hold zero 7s, the remaining 32 digits must contain all 5 claimed 7s. The probability of 5 sevens in 32 digits (expected 3.2) is low. Challenging is optimal if the bid is likely false.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have four 7s in my hand, which is a strong count for digit 7. Since no bids have been made yet, I want to start with a confident bid that reflects my hand and pressures others. Bidding 4 7s is a strong opening and likely believable given the total digits in play.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have the digits 95266027, which includes one 7. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have a total of 8 digits and one of them is 7, and there are 3 other players with 8 digits each, it's possible that there are more 7s or higher digits. I can see that I have two 6s and no digits higher than 7 except none. A reasonable next bid could be to increase the digit, so bidding 4 8s is a valid move. However, considering the distribution, bidding 5 7s is also plausible as it increases the quantity.

Player 1 Reasoning: Since I'm Player 1 and I start the bidding, I need to make the first bid. My hand is 95266027, which contains two 6s and other digits. Given that there are 24 total digits remaining across all players, a reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and a conservative estimate. I see I have two 6s, so there are at least two 6s in total. I can start by bidding a quantity that is not too high but still reflects a reasonable guess. Bidding 5 6s seems like a good starting point as it increases the quantity significantly but is still within a plausible range considering there are 24 digits in total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 6s by Player 1 and considering my hand has no 6s, I must assess the likelihood of this bid being true. With 24 total digits remaining and 3 players, each having 8 digits, the maximum count for any digit is 24. The bid of 5 6s seems plausible but challenging it could be beneficial if I believe the actual count is less than 5. However, without any 6s in my hand, I lack direct evidence to confidently challenge. Instead, I should consider making a bid that is strictly higher. Since the current bid is on the digit 6, I could either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same or higher quantity. Given that I have multiple occurrences of the digit 3 and no 6s, and considering the game's progression, bidding on a different digit might be wise. Yet, the safest increase would be to bid on a higher digit with the same quantity or more, but given my hand and the aim to not overbid, I must carefully choose. Bidding 5 7s or higher seems risky without knowing the distribution of 7s and higher digits among other players. Thus, considering the balance between risk and the information from my hand, challenging might not be the best option without strong evidence against the bid, and bidding higher than 5 on any digit without clear advantage from my hand could be risky.

Given that Player 3 confidently bid 6 6s, it is likely that there are at least that many 6s in total. I can make a higher bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit to 7s with the same quantity (6) is valid. I have four 7s in my hand, which supports bidding 6 7s as a plausible move.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have two 7s in my hand (95266027). Considering there are 24 digits in total and 16 digits from the other two players, it's plausible that the total count of 7s is at least 6. However, bidding higher is required. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have information about my hand and the total count, I can make an educated guess. Bidding 7 7s is a reasonable increase in quantity. Alternatively, bidding 6 8s is also valid as it increases the digit. Given that I don't have any 8s, I lean towards increasing the quantity of 7s as it's more informed by my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 7 7s and the total digits remaining being 24, it seems unlikely that there are 7 or more 7s. My hand contains no 7s, which further decreases the likelihood. Considering the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and we are already at a high bid, challenging seems like the most reasonable action. The previous bids and challenges have not provided enough information to safely assume the existence of 7 or more 7s, making a challenge a strategic move to potentially eliminate Player 1.

Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 3 4s, and considering my hand contains two 3s but only one 4, I must decide whether to increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand has a limited number of 4s and no 5s or higher, bidding a higher quantity of 4s or any higher digit seems risky. However, I notice that the total number of digits remaining is 16, and with each player having 8 digits, the maximum any single digit can appear is 16 times across both players. Given this, bidding a higher quantity of a lower digit might be safer. Since I have two 3s and the bid is currently on 4s, I could try to increase the digit, but given my hand's composition, it seems more prudent to challenge the bid of 3 4s, as it's possible that the total count of 4s might not meet this quantity, especially considering the distribution of digits in my own hand and the fact that we are near the end of the game with limited information about the opponent's hand.
