Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 0, making the current bid of 1 0s definitely true, so challenging would lose. I have two 2s in my hand. Bidding 2 2s is safe since the total count of 2s across all players must be at least 2 (my two), making this bid truthful and harder to challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge Player 1's bid of '2 2s'. Looking at my hand (04318425), I have one 2 in my hand. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For Player 1's bid to be false, there would need to be fewer than 2 twos among all players. Given that I already have one 2, this means there would need to be zero 2s among the other 5 players' 40 digits, which is highly unlikely. Therefore, challenging would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I could bid '3 2s' (increasing quantity) or '2 3s' (same quantity, higher digit). Since I have one 3 in my hand, bidding '2 3s' seems reasonable and safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand (54218693). With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. Player 2's bid of '2 3s' is quite conservative. Given I can see one 3, it's very likely there are more 3s among the other 40 digits I can't see. I'll make a slightly higher bid of '2 4s' since I have one 4 in my hand, and it's a safe increase that maintains similar probability while moving to a higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s made by Player 3. I have the digits 7, 9, 6, 3, 8, 5, 2, and 8 in my hand. I see that there are 2 4s already bid and my hand does not contain any 4s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains two 8s, I can bid on 8s. Bidding 2 8s seems reasonable as it's higher in digit value than 4s and I have two 8s to back up the possibility of this being a valid bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. My hand is 77681714, which contains one 8. So, out of my 8 digits, 1 is an 8. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 8, it's plausible that there are at least 2 8s in total among all players. However, bidding more than 2 8s might be challenging without more information. I can bid 2 9s, which is a higher bid than 2 8s by increasing the digit. This seems like a reasonable next step.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (04318425), I have one 2. The current bid by Player 1 is '3 2s', meaning they believe there are at least 3 twos among all players. Since I have 1 two, and there are 6 players with 8 digits each (48 total digits), it's quite reasonable that there are at least 2 more twos among the other 5 players. The bidding has been conservative so far, with players mostly increasing the digit rather than the quantity. I could bid '3 3s' since I have one 3 in my hand, or I could increase the quantity to '4 2s', but that's riskier since I only know about my one 2. I could also bid '3 4s' since I have one 4 in my hand. I think '3 4s' is a safe bid that advances the game without taking too much risk.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand (54218693). The current bid is '3 4s', which means Player 2 thinks there are at least three 4s total among all 48 digits. Given that I've seen one 4 and there are 5 other players who could have 4s, this seems like a reasonable bid. I could increase to '3 5s' since I have a 5 in my hand, making a slightly higher but still safe bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 3. I have the digits 7, 9, 6, 3, 8, 5, 2, and 8 in my hand, which means I have one 5. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 5, increasing the quantity to 4 or more 5s is unlikely. Therefore, bidding a higher digit seems reasonable. I will bid 1 6s, as 6 is a higher digit than 5 and I have one 6 in my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits: 7, 9, 6, 3, 8, 5, 2, 8. I see that I have one 5 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my goal is to make a higher bid and I have multiple 8s which are higher than 5, I can bid on 8s. With two 8s in my hand, bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None' as it's the start of the round. I have 8 digits in my hand: 77681714, which contains two 7s and one 1 and one 8. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the likelihood of digits appearing across all players. Since there are 5 active players with 8 digits each, the total count is 40 digits. A conservative initial bid is appropriate. I will bid on a digit that is relatively common or one that I have in my hand. I have two 7s, so bidding on 7s seems reasonable. A bid of 5 7s is a good starting point as it reflects a moderate count considering the distribution and my own hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. With 40 total digits remaining, the average count for any digit is 4. I have one 7 in my hand, which would mean the remaining 32 digits (other players' hands) would need to contain four more 7s to meet the bid. Given the average of 3.2 7s in the remaining digits, this seems unlikely. Challenging the bid carries a higher probability of success.

Given that there are 32 total digits remaining across all players, a reasonable starting bid could be related to the digits I see in my hand or a relatively safe guess.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 5's bid of 7 7s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (04318425), I have zero 7s. Player 5 has now bid on 7s twice in a row, first claiming 5 7s (which was challenged and proven correct), and now claiming 7 7s. This suggests Player 5 likely has multiple 7s in their hand. However, for there to be 7 total 7s, the other two players (3 and 4) would need to have 7 7s between them, which seems possible but not guaranteed. Since I have no 7s, and Player 5 has shown confidence in 7s, I'll make a higher bid rather than challenge. I'll bid 8 0s since I have two 0s in my hand, which gives me some confidence in this digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (54218693), I have zero 0s. Player 2's bid of 8 0s means there need to be 8 zeros across all 32 remaining digits. Since I have none, and it's relatively early in the bidding, this seems like a risky bid. Even if the other three players each had 2-3 zeros, it would be hard to reach 8 total. Given the previous bidding patterns and my complete lack of zeros, this bid seems unlikely to be true.

Player 3 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and have a good view of my hand: 54218693. Since I have one 5, bidding a conservative quantity of 2 5s is a reasonable opening move. This leaves room for escalation while being likely true given there are 24 total digits across all players. Starting with a mid-range digit like 5 gives flexibility for future bidding in either direction.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand (54218693). With 3 players and 24 total digits, the claim of '3 7s' is possible but seems high given I only see one. Player 5 has shown aggressive bidding behavior in previous rounds with 7s specifically (bidding 5 7s and 7 7s earlier). Given this pattern and that I only see one 7, there's a good chance they're bluffing. A challenge here is safer than raising to 4 of any digit.

Given that there are 16 digits in total and I have two 7s, a reasonable starting bid could be around the count of my most frequent digit or a digit I have. I have two 7s, so bidding on 7s seems reasonable. A bid of 3 7s or 4 7s might be too high given I only have two 7s, but it's a good starting point to gauge the other player's hand.
