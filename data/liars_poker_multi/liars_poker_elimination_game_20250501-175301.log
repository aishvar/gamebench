Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of the game. Looking at my hand (05194319), I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 9, and two 1s. Since I have two 1s, that's my most frequent digit. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. If the distribution were perfectly even, each digit (0-9) would appear about 4.8 times. I'll start with a conservative bid of 5 1s, which is slightly above the expected average but reasonable given I already have two 1s in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. Player 0 bid 5 1s. It is likely that there are at least 5 1s in total, but I cannot be certain. However, I have two 3s in my hand, and no other players have bid on 3s yet. I can reasonably bid 4 3s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s and one 9 in my hand. Player 0 bid 5 1s. Since I have a 9, I can bid 3 9s, which is a higher bid than 5 1s because the digit is higher. This seems like a reasonable and strategic move.

Player 2 Reasoning: As the starting player, I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 5s and two 8s. Bidding '3 5s' is a reasonable starting point since I already have two, and it's likely there's at least one more 5 among the other players' 32 digits. This bid balances quantity and digit value while being defensible if challenged.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand (digits: 73828485), which supports the bid of 3 5s made by Player 2. The current bid is 3 5s, so to make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. The next higher digit after 5 is 6, and bidding 3 6s is valid and reasonable based on my hand. I don't have any 6s, but the bid is not too high to be challenged immediately.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s follows the required bid hierarchy (same quantity, higher digit than 6) and is guaranteed to be truthful since my hand alone contains exactly three 7s. This forces opponents to either raise further or challenge a bid that is already met by my hand alone.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains an 8, and the current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid since the digit (8) is higher than 7, maintaining the same quantity. This leverages my own digits while following the bidding rules.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. My hand is 05194319, which contains no 8s. The current bid is '3 8s' made by Player 5. With 5 active players and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits in play. For the bid of '3 8s' to be valid, at least 3 of the 40 digits need to be 8s. Since I have no 8s in my hand, all 3 would need to come from the other 4 players' hands (32 digits total). This is certainly possible. I could bid '3 9s' (I have one 9 in my hand) or increase the quantity to '4' of a lower digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, which gives me some confidence. I'll bid '4 1s' as I know I have 2 of them already, so I only need 2 more among the other 32 digits, which seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. My hand contains two 5s, and the expected number of 1s across 40 digits is 4 (10% chance per digit). Bidding 4 5s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, leveraging my two 5s and the likelihood that other players hold additional 5s. Challenging 4 1s risks elimination if the actual count is exactly 4, which is statistically plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s, which means at least four 5s exist among all players. I have two 5s in my hand (digits: 7 3 8 2 8 4 8 5), so the bid is plausible but not guaranteed. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 with any digit is a big jump, so I prefer to keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit to 6. This is a safe increment and keeps the bid reasonable based on my hand and the previous bids.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand, making 4 7s a credible bid. Bidding 4 7s follows the required hierarchy (same quantity, higher digit) compared to the current bid of 4 6s. This leverages my strong personal holding while advancing the bidding logically.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 7 and one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid since it maintains the same quantity (4) but increases the digit (8 > 7). This leverages my possession of an 8 while adhering to the rules.

Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (05194319), I have zero 8s. The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 5. With 5 active players each having 8 digits, there are 40 total digits in play. For the bid of 4 8s to be valid, the other 4 players would need to have at least 4 8s among them. Since I don't have any 8s, all 4 would need to come from the other players. While this is possible, I can make a higher bid. I have two 1s in my hand, and I previously bid 4 1s, so I know there are at least 2 1s. I could bid 4 9s (same quantity, higher digit) or 5 0s/5 1s (higher quantity). Since I have one 9 and one 0 in my hand, bidding 5 1s seems safest as I already know about 2 of them from my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. Bidding 5 5s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity. Since I have two 5s, and there are four other players, it's plausible there are at least five 5s total. This is a valid higher bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have two 5s in my hand (digits: 73828485), which supports the plausibility of 5 total 5s among all players. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Increasing the digit from 5 to 6 while keeping the quantity at 5 is a valid move. I have one 6 in my hand, which gives some confidence. Bidding 5 6s is a reasonable step up and not overly risky.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand, making a bid of 5 7s plausible since only two more 7s are needed across the remaining 32 digits. This bid is strictly higher than the current 5 6s (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages my strong holding in 7s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. With 40 total digits remaining, the expected number of 7s is 4 (40 * 1/10). Bidding 5 7s is slightly above average, making it a potential bluff. My hand contains one 7, but others may not have enough to reach 5. Challenging this bid is reasonable as it could expose a lie.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand, making it a strong candidate for a bid. Starting with 4 7s leverages my own digits while considering there are 32 total digits across 4 players. This bid builds on prior rounds where 7s were actively bid, suggesting they are a contested digit.

Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. In my hand of 8 digits, I have zero 7s. The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 4. With 4 players remaining and 8 digits each (32 total digits), and knowing I have no 7s, the other 3 players would need to have at least 4 7s among them. That's certainly possible, with each player having on average 1.33 sevens. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, one 0, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 9, and one 1 again. I could bid 4 8s, which is higher than 4 7s, or I could bid 5 7s, increasing the quantity. Since I have one 9 in my hand, bidding 4 9s might be safer. Given that I have no 7s and the bid is already at 4 7s, I'll go with 4 8s as a reasonable next bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which is exactly met if the other three players have two 8s total. Challenging risks elimination if the bid is valid. Bidding 5 8s increases the quantity, requiring three more 8s in the remaining 24 digits. While uncertain, this is plausible given the number of players. Bidding 5 8s maintains pressure without immediate risk.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have three 8s in my hand (positions 2, 5, and 7). Since the total digits are 32, having at least 5 eights is plausible but somewhat high. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 5 and increase the digit. The next valid bids after 5 8s are 5 9s or 6 0s. I have no 9s or 0s in my hand, but bidding 5 9s is the minimal increase and still reasonable. Bidding 6 0s is a jump in quantity and less likely given my hand. Therefore, I will bid 5 9s to keep the pressure while not risking a challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand. With 32 total digits remaining across 4 players, the expected count for any specific digit (like 9s) is around 3.2. Bidding 5 9s requires at least 5 9s in total, which seems statistically unlikely given my hand and average distribution. Challenging this bid is a calculated risk based on the low probability of meeting or exceeding the bid quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 4 sevens among all players. In my hand (05194319), I have 1 seven. For there to be at least 4 sevens total, Players 2 and 4 would need to have at least 3 more sevens between them. With 16 unknown digits between the other two players, this is certainly possible. Looking at previous rounds, Player 4 seems to favor bidding on 7s, which might indicate they have several 7s in their hand. I could bid higher, either by increasing the quantity to 5 or keeping the quantity at 4 but increasing the digit to 8 or 9. Since I have one 9 in my hand, bidding 4 9s would be a safer option than increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 5 0s, 5 1s, or 5 3s since I have multiple of those digits in my hand. I'll go with 4 9s as it's the minimal valid increase from the current bid.
