Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid of the round, I can bid anything as long as it's a valid bid. I have one 8, one 5, two 0s, one 1, one 3, and one 2 in my hand. Bidding 1 8s is a safe starting bid, as I know there's at least one 8 in play. It's a low quantity but a higher digit than 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I hold one 9 and no 8s. The current bid is only 1 8s, which I can minimally top with 1 9s. Since I have a 9, this bid is safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 1 9s, which is very low. Since I have one 9, it's likely there are at least one or two more 9s among the other players. Bidding 2 9s is a safe increase that maintains the digit but increases the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable increase, as it increases the quantity and decreases the digit slightly, which is a safer play given my hand and the bidding history.

Player 3 bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:4 - claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. With 6 active players and 8 digits each (48 total), the bid of 3 8s is quite reasonable. Since I have one 8, and there are 5 other players who could easily have two more 8s between them, I should make a higher bid. Given my hand also has a 9, I can confidently bid '3 9s', which is higher than '3 8s' while staying conservative.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 4 0s is a safe increase, as it is the lowest digit and increases the quantity.

Player 5 bids: 4 0s

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:2 - google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 5 0s would be a reasonable bluff, as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 1, 5 or 8. However, given the previous bids focusing on 8s and 9s, and the fact that 4 0s is already a relatively low bid, increasing the quantity of 0s seems like the safest option. It's less likely someone has a large number of 0s, and I have some to contribute to the count. Bidding on 8s or 9s feels riskier given the previous bids and my limited count of those digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s by Player 0. I have no zeros but I hold two 7s. With 48 total cards we expect about 4.8 sevens overall, so needing just three more among the 40 unknown cards is quite plausible (P≈78%). Bidding 5 7s is a valid increase (same quantity, higher digit) and supported by my hand.

Player 1 bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:3 - deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 5 7s, which means there would need to be at least four more 7s among the other five players (total of 40 digits). Given that the previous bids have been relatively low and the digit 7 hasn't been bid on until now, it's unlikely there are five 7s in total. Challenging seems like the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. With 40 digits in play there are on average about 4 sevens total, and the probability of at least 4 sevens is high (~84%). Opening with 4 sevens is a safe and strong bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. This makes a total of at least 4 7s unlikely. I should challenge the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With 32 total digits, the expected count for any digit is about 3.2, and there’s over a 90% chance at least one more 6 appears among the other 24 unseen digits. Opening with 3 sixes is a reasonable, safe bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand of 46749814. With 32 total digits and 4 players, the bid of 3 6s seems reasonable. Given my previous successful bids involving 7s and my hand containing one 7, I can safely bid 3 7s, which is higher than 3 6s while staying conservative.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. I could bid 3 8s, but that's only a marginal increase. I could also bid 4 of any digit. I will bid 4 0s, as 0 has not been bid in a while, and I have one in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 5 0s is a logical next step, increasing the quantity. While it's a risk, it's a reasonable bid given my hand and the current game state. I believe this is a better option than challenging, as 4 0s is not an incredibly high bid and could be accurate.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 0s in my hand, so all 5 zeros must be among the other 24 cards. With expectation of 2.4 zeros in 24 cards, the probability of seeing 5 or more is under 10%, making this bid extremely unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With 16 unknown digits among the other two players, there’s about an 82% chance of at least one more 6, making a bid of 3 6s a reasonable and strong opening.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand of 46749814, I have zero 6s. The current bid is 3 6s, meaning Player 1 claims there are at least 3 sixes among all 24 digits (8 digits per player × 3 players). Given that I have no 6s, this means Player 1 and Player 5 would need to have at least 3 sixes between them. While this is possible, Player 1's previous bidding patterns and wins suggest they're a confident player. I could bid higher, but with no 6s in my hand, I'd be taking a significant risk. Since I have direct evidence contradicting the current bid (0 sixes in my hand), challenging seems safer than making a higher bid based on uncertain information.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 1 9s is guaranteed correct since total nines ≥1. Opponent cannot bid a higher digit at quantity 1, so they must challenge and will lose.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding 2 0s seems like a reasonable move, as it's only slightly above the current bid and I have a 0 in my hand to support it. Challenging could be risky if Player 1 also has a 9.
