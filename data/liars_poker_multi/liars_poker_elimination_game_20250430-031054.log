Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 2s and one 8 in my hand. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each, the total number of digits is 48. Starting with a bid of 3 2s is reasonable because I already have three 2s in my hand, making it likely that there are at least three 2s across all players.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 3, one 5, two 6s, one 8, and two 0s in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s. I need to bid higher.  Based on my hand, I have two 6s and two 0s. Bidding 4 0s or 4 6s are both valid options. Bidding 4 0s is a higher quantity than the current bid of 3 2s and a higher digit than the 2s. Bidding 4 6s is also a higher quantity and a higher digit. Bidding 4 0s seems slightly safer as 0s are generally more common, but 4 6s is also a reasonable bid given I have two.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. I can bid 5 0s, increasing the quantity. This is a safe bid as I know at least two 0s exist, and it's not an unreasonable increase given the total number of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. There are 48 total digits (6 players * 8 digits). The expected average count for any digit is 4.8. A bid of 5 is slightly above average, but plausible. I have zero 0s in my hand (37793132). This means the other 5 players (40 digits) need to have at least five 0s. While possible, especially since Player 1 bid 4 0s and Player 2 raised to 5 0s, challenging feels risky this early. I should consider making a higher bid based on my hand. My hand contains three 3s. Bidding 5 3s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). With my three 3s, only two more 3s are needed among the remaining 40 digits across the other 5 players. The expected number of 3s among those 40 digits is 4. Needing only 2 makes this a statistically safe and strong bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have two 3s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of this bid. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Increasing the digit to 4s with the same quantity of 5 is a valid move. Since I don't have any 4s in my hand, bidding 5 4s is slightly riskier but still plausible given the total number of digits. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 6 with digit 0s or 1s, but that seems more aggressive. Given the current bid and my hand, bidding 5 4s is a reasonable and safe next bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. My hand is 06764111, which contains three 1s, two 6s, one 0, one 4, and one 7. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4.8. To make a valid higher bid, I can increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Based on my hand, I have a strong count of 1s (three). Bidding 6 1s requires a total of six 1s. Since I have three, I need three more 1s from the other 40 digits held by 5 players. The average number of 1s among the other players would be 40/10 = 4. Needing only 3 more is below average expectation, making 6 1s a plausible and well-supported bid based on my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s, and I have only one 1 in my hand (from my hand 82822678). With 5 other players, it's possible that there are enough 1s to meet the bid, but it's risky to challenge. I have three 2s in my hand, so I can bid 6 2s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 09056863. I have two 0s, two 6s, one 9, one 5, one 8, and one 3. The current bid is 6 2s. I have zero 2s in my hand. A bid of 6 2s implies there are at least 6 2s among the 48 total digits. With 6 players and 8 digits each, the average count for any digit is 4.8 (48/10). A bid of 6 is slightly above average. Given I have no 2s, and the bid is already 6, challenging seems risky as someone else could have several 2s. I need to bid higher. I have two 0s and two 6s. Bidding 7 0s or 7 6s are both valid higher bids. Bidding 7 0s seems slightly safer as 0s have already been bid on (4 0s and 5 0s earlier), potentially indicating others have some. Bidding 7 6s is also an option based on my hand. Given the current bid is 6 2s, bidding 7 of any digit is a reasonable step up. I will bid 7 0s based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 0s. With 48 total digits, the expected average count for any digit is 4.8. My hand (37793132) contains zero 0s. This means for the bid of 8 0s to be true, the remaining 40 digits held by the other 5 players must contain at least eight 0s. This requires an average of 1.6 zeros per remaining player, which is significantly above the expected average. While Players 1 and 2 have previously bid 0s, reaching a quantity of 8 seems statistically unlikely, especially since I hold none. Therefore, challenging the bid is the most logical action.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. There are 5 players remaining, each with 8 digits, totaling 40 digits. The expected count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. The current bid is exactly the expected value. My hand is 06764111, containing one 0, three 1s, one 4, two 6s, and one 7. Challenging 4 0s is risky, as the expected count is 4.2 (1 from my hand + 3.2 from others), meaning the actual count is likely to be 4 or more. I should bid higher. My strongest digit is 1 (three of them). Bidding 4 1s is safe (need one more 1 from 32 digits, expected 3.2). Bidding 5 1s is also very safe (need two more 1s from 32 digits, expected 3.2) and increases the quantity, putting more pressure on opponents. Given the safety and the strategic advantage of increasing the quantity, bidding 5 1s is a strong move.

The next valid bid must be higher than 5 1s, so either 6 0s or 6 1s or higher. Since 0s have been bid multiple times and I have one 0, bidding 6 0s is plausible.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 09056863, which contains two 0s. The current bid is 6 0s. With only 3 players and 24 total digits, a bid of 6 0s is quite high, implying Player 4 believes there are at least four 0s in the other two hands combined (or a very strong hand of 0s themselves). Given my two 0s, it's possible, but the probability of 6 total 0s is getting low. However, challenging 6 0s with my hand is risky. I can make a higher bid. Bidding 6 1s is a valid higher bid, but I have no 1s. Bidding 7 0s is also a valid higher bid, but I only have two 0s, making 7 0s seem very unlikely. Bidding 6 3s is a valid higher bid, and I have one 3. Bidding 6 5s is a valid higher bid, and I have one 5. Bidding 6 6s is a valid higher bid, and I have two 6s. Bidding 6 8s is a valid higher bid, and I have one 8. Bidding 6 9s is a valid higher bid, and I have one 9. Bidding 7 of any digit is also an option. Bidding 6 6s is the most supported bid I can make at the same quantity, using my two 6s. Increasing the quantity to 7 feels too risky given the current bid and remaining digits. Bidding 6 6s is a safer increment.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 2s. I need to bid higher than this. The next higher bid could be 7 3s or 8 0s or higher. In my hand, I have one '2' and no '3's. The digit '2' is at 7 currently, so bidding 7 3s is a small increment but I have no '3's to support it. Alternatively, bidding 8 0s is a bigger jump but I have two '0's in my hand, which supports a higher quantity bid on '0's. Given there are 24 digits total, and the previous bids indicate some confidence in zeros, bidding 8 0s is reasonable and a valid increase over 7 2s. I will bid 8 0s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. Since there are only 16 total digits, it is plausible that there are at least three 6s. I could bid higher, but I don't have any information to suggest a specific digit is more or less likely. Therefore, I will bid slightly higher to continue the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one 7. The current bid is 4 7s. With only 16 total digits, a bid of 4 7s means the other player would need to have at least three 7s. While possible, it feels slightly high given the total number of digits. I could bid higher, but my hand doesn't strongly support a higher bid on any digit. Challenging seems like a reasonable play here, as the probability of there being four or more 7s across 16 digits (with me having one) is not overwhelmingly high.
