Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a low bid. I have one 0 in my hand, so bidding 1 0s seems like a safe opening move.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have four 8s and two 0s in my hand, totaling six 8s and two 0s. The current bid is 1 0s, which is very low. Bidding 2 0s is safe, but I can also consider increasing the digit to 8 for a higher bid with the same quantity, which aligns better with my hand. Since I have four 8s, bidding 2 8s seems reasonable and a strategic move to challenge the previous bid without overcommitting. Alternatively, I could bid 2 0s, but increasing the digit to 8 makes the bid more significant and less predictable. Given my hand strength, I will bid 2 8s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 7 and one 1 in my hand, but no 8s. The bid is low, so increasing the quantity to 3 or increasing the digit to a higher number with the same quantity is possible. The next higher bid after 2 8s can be 2 9s or 3 0s. Since 2 9s is a small increment and more plausible, I will bid 2 9s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have four 9s in my hand (99790359). The current bid is 2 9s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. On average, there should be around 4-5 of each digit (48 / 10 = 4.8). Having four 9s myself makes it highly likely that the total number of 9s is at least 4. Bidding 4 9s is a safe and reasonable increase from the current bid of 2 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand. To top the current bid of 4 9s, I must raise the quantity to at least 5. If I bid 5 1s, I already supply three of them, so only two more 1s are needed among the remaining 40 hidden digits. Assuming a roughly uniform distribution, the chance of there being at least two additional 1s is very high (about 91%). This makes 5 1s a strong, defensible bid while still applying pressure to the next players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. My hand is 65373395. I have zero 1s. The expected number of any digit across the 48 total digits is 4.8. A bid of 5 1s is slightly above average, but plausible. Challenging seems risky as 5 is close to the expected value, even though I have none. I need to make a higher bid. A higher bid could be 6 1s or 5 2s or higher. I have three 3s in my hand. This strongly supports a bid involving 3s. Bidding 5 3s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Since I hold three 3s, only two more 3s are needed among the remaining 40 digits held by other players. This is statistically likely (expected number of 3s among the other 40 digits is 4). Therefore, bidding 5 3s is a safe and well-supported move.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. Bidding 6 3s is a safe increase. Alternatively, I could bid 6 of any other digit, but I'll stick with 3s since I have one.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. Considering my hand (00484880), I have two 8s and two 4s, but no 3s. The total number of 3s in all hands is unlikely to reach 6, especially given the distribution and my own hand. Challenging now could be advantageous since the bid seems overly optimistic. Bidding higher on 3s would be risky given my hand, so a challenge is the best move to potentially eliminate an opponent if the count is less than 6.

Player 1 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet in this round, I can start by making a conservative bid based on my hand. I have four 8s (positions 2,3,6,7), so I know there are at least four 8s among all players if I include my hand. To be safe, I will bid 4 8s, which is a reasonable opening bid considering my hand and the total of 40 digits. This sets a baseline for the next player to challenge or raise.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I must bid higher either by increasing the quantity or the digit. I have one '7' in my hand and no '8's. Since 4 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit), and I have a '7', bidding 4 9s is plausible. Increasing the quantity to 5 seems risky given the current bid and my hand. Therefore, I will bid 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have four 9s in my hand (99790359). The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 2. Since I have exactly the number of 9s bid, and there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total digits), it's possible there are more 9s among the other players. However, bidding higher on 9s is risky as I already hold a significant portion. Bidding a higher digit with the same quantity (4 0s) is an option, but I only have one 0. A safer bet is to increase the quantity slightly based on my strong hand of 9s, assuming at least one other player has a 9. Bidding 5 9s is a reasonable increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have no 9s, so I can’t confidently challenge the bid of 5 9s—Player 2 and Player 3 have both been pushing 9s, suggesting they may hold several of them. Instead, I’ll raise the bid using a digit I’m strong in: I have three 1s. If I bid 6 1s, the table only needs three more 1s among the 32 unknown digits, which is statistically likely (over 60% chance under a uniform distribution). This is a safer path than challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. There are 5 players, so 40 total digits. The expected number of any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. My hand (65373395) contains zero 1s. For the bid of 6 1s to be correct, there must be at least 6 1s among the other 4 players (32 digits). The expected number of 1s in those 32 digits is 3.2. A bid of 6 is significantly higher than the expected value, especially since I contribute none. While I have three 3s and could bid 6 3s (which is plausible as I need 3 more from 32 digits), challenging the 6 1s bid seems statistically safer and offers a chance to eliminate Player 4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I hold three 1s (about one-third of the four I plan to claim). With 32 digits in play, the average count for any digit is a little over 3, so needing just one more 1 among the other 24 hidden digits is very likely (>90%). Opening with 4 1s is a safe, credible bid that forces later players to raise either the quantity or the digit while keeping my elimination risk low if someone were to challenge immediately.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s, and I have the digits 0, 0, 4, 8, 4, 8, 8, 0. Counting the 1s in my hand, I have zero 1s. Given that the bid is 4 1s, and I know I can't meet this bid based on my hand, challenging is the safest option. The total remaining digits are 32, so the actual count of 1s is at most 8, making the bid unlikely to be true. Challenging now could force the opponent to reveal the count and potentially eliminate them if they are bluffing.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have two 1s in my hand (digits: 1,7,1,2,7,1,5,7). Since there are 24 digits total, and I hold two 1s, it is reasonable to believe that there are at least 4 1s in total. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. I will increase the quantity to 5 and keep the digit at 1s, as bidding 5 1s is a valid higher bid and plausible given my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have four 9s in my hand. The current bid is 5 1s. With 24 total digits, a bid of 5 1s is plausible, but not guaranteed. Given my strong hand in 9s (4 of them), bidding 6 9s seems like a strong and safe play, significantly increasing the bid based on my own digits.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my eight digits. The current bid claims there are at least six 9s among the 24 total digits, meaning 25% of all digits would have to be 9s. The expected number of 9s is only about 2–3, so reaching six is highly improbable. Any legal overbid would require stating at least seven of some digit, which is even riskier than calling this unlikely bid. Therefore, challenging is the best move.

By bidding 3 1s, the claim is automatically true thanks to my own digits, so I cannot lose if Player 2 decides to challenge. Because most 8-digit hands contain 0 or 1 ones, the bid will look doubtful to them and is likely to be challenged, giving me a strong chance to win immediately. If they choose to raise instead, I’ll still be in a good position to respond.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have three 1s in my hand (digits at positions 2, 4, and 8: 1, 1, 1). Since there are only 16 digits total and I hold three 1s, it is reasonable to increase the bid. The next valid higher bid after 3 1s can be 3 2s or 4 0s, but I do not have any 2s and only one 7, so bidding 3 2s might be risky. Bidding 4 1s would be a higher quantity but I already bid 5 1s in a previous round, and the current bid is 3 1s, so bidding 4 1s is a safe increase. I will bid 4 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I can see 3 ones in my own hand (62584111). For Player 2’s bid of 4 1s to be valid, they must have at least one 1 in their eight unknown digits. With a random distribution each digit appears with probability 0.1, so the chance of Player 2 having no 1s at all is (0.9)^8 ≈ 43 %. That gives me about a 43 % chance of winning if I challenge right now. Any legal raise I could make is statistically worse: the most plausible raise would be 5 1s, but that would require Player 2 to have at least two 1s, which happens only about 19 % of the time, and they would almost certainly challenge such a bid. Other possible raises (e.g., 4 2s or 5 of any other digit) have still lower success probabilities. Therefore, challenging offers the highest likelihood of eliminating Player 2 compared with any available bid.
