Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I can make an initial bid. I have three 2s in my hand. Bidding 3 2s seems like a reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8. Bidding 4 2s is a reasonable increase based on the average and my hand. Although I only have one 2, it's early in the game, and increasing the quantity by one is a standard move. Alternatively, I could bid a lower quantity but a higher digit, but increasing the quantity is often preferred early on.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. I can increase the digit and the quantity with '5 8s'. The current bid is 4 2s, and I have seen no reason to doubt the current bid. I should make a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. My hand is 71057334, which contains one 8. So, I have some information that supports the existence of 8s, but I need to consider the total count. With 48 total digits and one 8 in my hand, the bid of 5 8s seems plausible because it's less than 10% of the total digits. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 6 would be a reasonable next step if I believe in the presence of 8s. However, I can also consider bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have information about my own hand, I'll analyze it: my digits are 7, 1, 0, 5, 7, 3, 3, 4. There are no 8s or 9s. Bidding 5 9s is not reasonable because I know there's at least one player who doesn't have a 9. Bidding 6 8s is a safer choice as it slightly increases the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The statistical average number of 8s across all players' hands is 4.8. With two 8s in my hand, the remaining players would statistically hold only 2.8 8s combined. This makes the bid of 6 8s highly unlikely. Given the mathematical improbability, challenging the bid is the optimal strategy.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None' as it's the start of the round and I am Player 3, who starts the bidding. I have the hand 71057334, which contains two 8s and one 3, among other digits. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and the total number of digits. Since there are 40 digits in total and I have 8 of them, I can make an educated guess. Bidding 7 3s seems reasonable as it is a relatively conservative bid considering the total count of digits and my hand has one 3.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 7 3s, which means there would need to be at least 6 more 3s among the other 4 players (32 digits). Given that the previous round had a high count of 8s, it's unlikely that 3s are this prevalent. Challenging seems like the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The previous round showed that 8s are a common digit, with a bid of 6 8s being valid (actual count was 8). Starting with a bid of 3 8s is conservative but reasonable given the history and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. I could bid 4 of any digit, or 3 of a digit higher than 8 (9). I have one 9, so bidding 3 9s is a valid and safe option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand. With 4 players and 32 total digits, the average count of any digit is 3.2. A bid of 3 9s is plausible, especially since Player 0 made it. However, I have three 4s in my hand. Bidding 4 4s is a safe and higher bid based on my strong hand in 4s and the general distribution of digits.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 4s. I know that there are at least 3 8s and 3 9s already bid, which means that there are at least 6 8s in play. Bidding 5 8s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand and the bids made by other players.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 5 8s, which means there would need to be at least three more 8s among the other three players' hands (total of 24 digits). Given that 8s are relatively rare and the previous round showed only 5 8s in total, bidding higher seems risky. I should challenge the current bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. There are 24 digits remaining across 3 players. Player 2 previously bid 5 8s, which was challenged and won with a count of 6. Bidding 6 8s seems reasonable, as it's likely there are at least 6 8s remaining, and it increases both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I have one 6 and one 2 in my hand. I don't have any 8s. Since there are only 24 total digits, and the previous player bid 6 8s, it is plausible, but on the higher end. I will bid slightly higher to put pressure on the next player. I will bid 7 9s, since I have one 9 in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand. With only 24 total digits, a bid of 7 9s seems quite high, implying a high concentration of 9s across the other two players. Based on the probability and my lack of 9s, challenging seems like the most advantageous move.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s and one 4 in my hand. Player 1 bid 3 4s. Since there are 16 digits remaining, it's possible that there are at least 3 4s, but I can confidently bid 4 8s, increasing both the quantity and the digit based on the digits in my hand. I could also challenge, but with 16 digits remaining, it's plausible that there are 3 4s, so bidding seems like a safer move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. With 16 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 1.6 (16 / 10).  A bid of 4 8s is already higher than what is statistically likely to be in my hand and Player 2's hand combined (1 + 1.6 = 2.6).  However, Player 2 just made this bid, suggesting they might have multiple 8s.  Challenging 4 8s is risky if Player 2 has 3 or more 8s.  Looking at my hand, I have two 4s. My previous bid was 3 4s, which was raised by Player 2.  Bidding 5 4s is a valid higher bid and is plausible given I have two 4s, requiring Player 2 to have at least three 4s.  This seems safer than challenging or bidding a higher quantity of 8s.

Player 2 Reasoning: Player 1 bid 5 4s. I have two 9s in my hand. Since I know Player 1 has at least 1 4 (otherwise, they wouldn't have bid 5 4s), there are likely 5 or more 4s in play. Bidding 6 4s is a reasonable move, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same. This bid is higher than the current bid of 5 4s.
