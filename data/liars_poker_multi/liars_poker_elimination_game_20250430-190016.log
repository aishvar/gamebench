Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 77126823, I notice I have two 7s and other digits. Given that there are 48 total digits and 6 players, it's reasonable to assume that at least one digit could appear more than once across all hands. Starting with a lower quantity and a digit I have in my hand seems like a safe approach. I will bid on the digit 7, as I have two of them, hoping that across all players, there might be at least three 7s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have no 7s in my hand (96506883), but statistically, 3 7s is plausible given 48 total digits. Bidding 3 8s is logical since I hold two 8s, making it likely to meet or exceed this bid. This bid is strictly higher than 3 7s (same quantity, higher digit).

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 11517895. I have one 8. The current bid is 3 8s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected number of 8s is around 4.8 (48 / 10). A bid of 3 8s is plausible. I can make a higher bid. I have two 1s, two 5s, one 7, one 8, and one 9. Bidding 4 1s, 4 5s, or 4 7s seems reasonable based on my hand and the general distribution. Bidding 4 1s is a good option as it's a higher quantity and a lower digit than the current bid, and I have two 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I hold two 8s in my hand and need only two more among the 40 unseen cards to make four 8s, which is highly probable given the expected distribution. Bidding 4 8s is a minimal strict increase over 4 1s that leverages my strong holding and carries relatively low risk.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 59292058, which contains two 9s. The current bid is 4 9s by Player 4. Since there are 48 total digits across 6 players, it's possible that there are at least two more 9s in other players' hands, making the bid of 4 9s plausible. However, I can make a higher bid to continue the game. I will bid 5 0s, as it increases the quantity and switches to a new digit, which might be safer given I have one 0 in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 5 0s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Looking at my hand, 77126823, I have multiple occurrences of the digit 7 and other digits. However, since the goal is to bid higher than 5 0s, I should consider either increasing the quantity or bidding on a higher digit. Since I have two 7s in my hand and considering the distribution of digits might not be even, bidding on a higher quantity of a digit I have or a higher digit seems reasonable. Given that 7 is a relatively high digit and I have two of them, but the current bid is on 0s which is the lowest digit, I should aim to increase the quantity or digit significantly to ensure my bid is credible and has a chance of winning. Bidding 6 0s would be a safe increase in quantity, but considering my hand and the potential distribution, I might take a risk and bid on a digit I have, aiming for a balance between credibility and strategic advantage.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. With 48 total digits and my hand containing no 1s, the expected total number of 1s across all hands is approximately 4.8 (based on uniform probability). Since Player 0's bid of 6 1s exceeds this expectation and I have no 1s to contribute, it is statistically unlikely that the total reaches 6. Challenging this bid carries a favorable risk-reward balance.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With 40 total digits across 5 players, the average count per digit is 4. Bidding 3 8s is conservative since I already hold two, making it likely at least one more exists among remaining digits. Starting with a credible bid avoids early elimination and pressures opponents.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. With 5 players and 40 digits total, the expected number of any digit is around 4. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable increase based on my hand and the number of players.

Player 3 Reasoning: I hold two 8s, so Player 2’s bid of 4 8s is quite plausible (needs only two more 8s among 32 unknown cards). Challenging has only ~15% chance to succeed. The smallest valid raise is to 4 9s. I have one 9, so this bid requires three 9s among 32 unknowns (~63% chance), making it the most conservative valid move.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 59292058, which contains two 0s. The current bid is 5 0s by Player 4. With 40 total digits across 5 players, an average of 4 zeros per player would be needed to reach 20 zeros, but bids are often optimistic. Since I have 2 zeros, it’s plausible that the total could be 5 or more if at least 3 other zeros are distributed among the other players. However, bidding higher, such as 5 1s or 6 0s, feels safer than challenging. I’ll bid 5 1s to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, as I have no 1s in my hand, but it’s a conservative increase to test the waters.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid of 5 1s requires at least five 1s across all 40 digits. With my hand containing zero 1s and the statistical average being four 1s in total (40 digits), the bid exceeds this expectation. Since Player 5's bid is likely a bluff and the probability of meeting or exceeding five 1s is low, challenging is the optimal move.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, making it plausible that there are at least 3 8s total across all players.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains one 8. The current bid is 3 8s. With 4 players and 32 total digits, the expected number of 8s is around 3.2 (32 / 10). Player 1's bid of 3 8s is reasonable. My hand has one 8, which supports this. I can bid higher. I have two 1s and two 5s. Bidding 4 1s or 4 5s are possibilities. Bidding 4 8s is also an option as I have one 8 and the expected count is close to 3. I will bid 4 8s as it's a direct increase on the previous bid and I have an 8 in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, which already accounts for a significant portion of the current bid of 3 8s. Since Player 3 initiated the bid, they likely hold at least one 8, making the total count potentially 3 or more. Challenging would risk elimination if the bid holds. Bidding 4 8s leverages my existing 8s and pressures other players to respond, as it requires a total of four 8s across all hands (two in mine and at least two in others). This bid is strategically aggressive while staying within plausible limits given the remaining digits.

Player 1's bid of 4 8s is higher than the expected value and I only have one 8. While it's possible the other players have a lot of 8s, challenging seems like a reasonable risk given the current bid and my hand.
