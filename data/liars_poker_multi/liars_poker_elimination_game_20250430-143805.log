Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and must make the first bid as the current bid is 'None'. My hand is 10365931, which includes two 1s and two 3s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. The expected average for any digit is 4.8 (48/10). Holding two 1s suggests that a bid involving 1s is plausible. Bidding '3 1s' is a reasonable starting point; it's slightly higher than my own count but well within the statistical expectation for the total number of 1s across all hands.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. Bidding 3 2s is a valid higher bid than the current 3 1s (same quantity, higher digit). Since I have two of this digit, it's reasonable to assume the third may be present in other players' hands.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s. Bidding 4 5s increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a valid and strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 5s by Player 2, I must decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. With my hand being 14989835, I have no 5s, which doesn't directly influence my decision on the current bid but indicates I shouldn't bid on 5s. Since the total number of digits is 48 and there are 6 players, each having 8 digits, the maximum number of any single digit across all players is 48. Considering the bidding history, the bids have been relatively conservative. The current bid of 4 5s seems plausible but not extremely high, given that we're still early in the game and digits are plentiful. However, without having any 5s in my hand, I lack direct insight into the likelihood of this bid being true. Given that I need to make a strictly higher bid, I could consider increasing the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains two 8s and one 9, bidding on these higher digits could be strategic, especially considering the game's early stage and the potential for these digits to appear less frequently than lower digits like 1 or 2. A bid of 4 8s would be a reasonable increase, leveraging the information from my hand while also considering the potential distribution of digits among other players.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, which supports the current bid of 4 8s to some extent. However, with 48 total digits across 6 players, a bid of 4 8s is plausible but not overly high. I need to make a higher bid than 4 8s. I can either increase the quantity to 5 or more of any digit, or keep the quantity at 4 and bid a higher digit like 9. Since I have no 9s in my hand, bidding on 9s might be riskier. I also have two 7s, which is decent support for a bid on 7s, but I must bid higher than 4 8s, so Iâ€™ll go for 5 7s to increase the quantity. This seems like a reasonable escalation, balancing risk and plausibility.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 5 and increase the digit. Since 7 is already a high digit, increasing the digit to 8 with the same quantity of 5 is a reasonable next step. I have one 8 in my hand, which supports this bid. Bidding 5 8s is a valid and plausible move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. The expected number of any digit across 48 total digits is 4.8. So, 5 is only slightly above average and not an outrageous bid, making a challenge risky at this stage. Player 3 previously bid 4 8s, and Player 5 raised to 5 8s, suggesting some belief in 8s or strategic pushing. I have zero 8s in my hand (10365931), which slightly lowers the probability for me, but doesn't make 5 impossible among the other 40 digits. Instead of challenging, I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 1s and two 3s. Bidding 6 1s is a valid next step (higher quantity than 5). Having two 1s provides support for this bid, as 6 is reasonably close to the expected count (4.8) plus my own contribution.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have no 1s in my hand, and with 40 remaining digits across 5 other players, the expected number of 1s is around 4 (assuming uniform distribution). The probability of the actual count being >=6 is low (~15%), making this bid statistically unlikely. Challenging is justified as the risk of elimination is outweighed by the high probability of the bid being false.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 6s. Since I have three 5s, I'm confident that there are at least four 5s in total. Bidding 4 5s is a valid higher bid because it has the same quantity but a lower digit than the current bid. Additionally, the previous round shows that high bids on the digit '1' were challenged and lost, suggesting that players might not have many 1s. This makes a bid on 5s more likely to succeed.

Given that there are 40 digits remaining and 5 players, it's reasonable to assume there could be at least 4 of a higher digit than 6. However, bidding 4 7s might be risky if others have many 7s. Challenging seems too risky because it's plausible that 4 6s exist among 5 players' hands. Bidding 5 5s is a safer increase, leveraging my hand and the likelihood of others having 5s.

Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 5 5s and considering my hand 14989835, I notice I have no 5s but I do have multiple occurrences of the digit 9 and 8. Since the bid needs to be strictly higher, I could either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Given that I have two 9s and a total of 40 digits remaining, bidding on 9s seems promising. However, the quantity of 5s bid by Player 2 is already high considering the total number of digits. Since I have two 9s, which is a significant portion of what could potentially be in other players' hands, I will choose to bid on 9s, increasing the digit from 5 to 9 and keeping the quantity the same as the current bid or slightly higher if feasible. Considering the risk of challenging without having a clear advantage and the potential for other players to have 5s, making a bid on a higher digit seems like a safer strategy at this point.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 88377576, which contains no 9s. The current bid is 5 9s by Player 3. With 40 total digits across 5 players, it's possible but not highly likely that there are 5 or more 9s in play, as that would mean the other 4 players have at least 5 9s combined in their 32 digits. Given the bidding history, Player 3 might be bluffing to push the bid higher. However, since I have no 9s, I can't confidently bid higher on 9s. I could bid 6 0s or switch to another digit, but I have a strong hand with two 8s and two 7s. Bidding 6 7s feels safer based on my own hand contributing two 7s, and it's a reasonable increase. Iâ€™ll avoid challenging for now since 5 9s is still within the realm of possibility.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand (03366252), meaning all 7s must be in the remaining 32 digits across 4 players. The average count per digit is 4 (40 total digits / 10 digits), and achieving 7 7s would require significantly above-average distribution.

Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 6s and my hand containing two 6s (14989835), I have a moderate amount of information to make a decision. The total number of digits remaining is 32, and with 4 players, each having 8 digits, the distribution of digits is crucial. Since I have two 6s, it's possible that other players also have a significant number of 6s, considering the bids made so far in the game. However, bidding higher than 5 6s, such as 6 6s, seems like a reasonable move because it increases the quantity, which is a straightforward way to make a higher bid. This move is based on the assumption that with my two 6s, and given that 6s have been a focus of bidding, there might be enough 6s among all players to make this bid plausible or to make challenging less appealing to others.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s made by Player 3. In my hand, I have two 6s, which contributes to the total count. With 4 active players and 32 total digits, the average number of 6s per player would be around 3.2 if distributed evenly, but it's unlikely to be exact. Given that I have 2, it's possible the total could be 6 or more, but I need to bid higher. I can either increase the quantity to 7 6s or switch to a higher digit. Looking at my hand, I have three 7s, which is a strong count for me. Bidding 6 7s keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, which is a valid higher bid. I think this is safer than pushing the quantity to 7 for 6s, as I have more confidence in 7s based on my hand. I'll bid 6 7s.
