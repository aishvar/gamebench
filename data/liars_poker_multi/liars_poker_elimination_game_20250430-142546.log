Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', which means I can make any initial bid. I should look for a digit in my hand that could be a good starting point. My hand is 25090730, so I have two 0s. Since there are 6 players and each has 8 digits, there are 48 digits in total. Starting with a low quantity and a digit I have seems reasonable. I will bid '2 0s' as my starting bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 2 0s. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable move as it increases both the quantity and the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (41256689), I have one 5 in it. Player 1 has bid 3 5s, meaning they believe there are at least 3 fives among all players. Since I have one 5, this means there need to be at least 2 more 5s among the other 5 players, which is quite reasonable. I could challenge, but the bid is still low and reasonable. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding on 6s would be strategic. I could bid either '3 6s' (same quantity but higher digit) or '4 5s' (higher quantity). Since I have two 6s already, bidding '3 6s' seems safer as I only need one more 6 among the other players, which is quite likely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand and expect on average about 4 more among the other 40 unknown digits, for around 5 total 6s. Claiming 4 6s is a conservative raise over 3 6s and is unlikely to be challenged.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, and the expected total number of 6s across all players is 4.8, making the current bid of 4 6s likely valid. Challenging would be risky. Instead, bidding 4 7s (same quantity, higher digit) is strategic, as my hand includes one 7 and the expected total for 7s is also around 4.8, keeping the bid reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have two 7s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. Since the highest digit is 9, bidding 4 8s is a reasonable next step, indicating confidence in the number of 8s across all hands. I have one 8 in my hand, which adds support to this bid.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 5. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. I have two 0s, but bidding 5 0s seems unlikely to be the best strategy given the current bids. However, I can see that bidding a higher digit with the same quantity or increasing the quantity could be viable. Since my hand contains a 9, which is higher than 8, and I have one 9, I can consider bidding 4 9s as it is a higher digit. Alternatively, I could try to challenge if I think 4 8s is unlikely. Given my hand (25090730), I have 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9. No 8s in my hand, which makes 4 8s seem unlikely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current round has just started with 5 active players. I have 8 secret digits: 2, 5, 0, 9, 0, 7, 3, 0. I see that my hand contains three 0s. Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. Given that I have three 0s and there are 40 total digits, bidding 4 0s seems reasonable as it accounts for the possibility of other players having at least one 0.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '4 0s'. I have two 5s in my hand. Given the bidding history and the digits remaining, I believe that there are likely 6 or more 1s among all players. Bidding '5 1s' increases both the quantity and the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (41256689), I have one 1 in it. Player 1 has bid 5 1s total across all players. With 5 players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits in play. For there to be 5 1s, that means 4 more 1s need to be in other players' hands. This is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's a risky move since the bid is quite reasonable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 6s. I'll bid 5 6s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value, which is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s by Player 2. I only have one 6, so there must be 4 more among the other 32 cards (Binomial(32,0.1)), which has only about a 48% chance—challenging is slightly favorable but risky. Instead I can raise to 5 9s: I hold three 9s already, so only two more are needed among the other 32 cards. P(Y≥2)≈0.91, making this a very safe raise and puts pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have no 9s in my hand, and with 32 digits across the other four players, the expected number of 9s is around 3.2. A bid of 5 9s is above this expectation and seems risky. Since Player 3's bid could be a bluff, challenging is a calculated risk based on statistical likelihood.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. With 32 total digits, the expected number of 9s is about 3.2; I only need one more among the other 24 hidden digits, which is highly likely (~92%). Starting with 4 9s is a safe, plausible opening bid using my strongest digit.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits: 2, 5, 0, 9, 0, 7, 3, 0. I can see that I have two 0s and one 9. Given that there are 32 total digits remaining and 4 active players, each player has 8 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. Since my goal is to either make a valid higher bid or challenge the last bid, I should consider the likelihood of the current bid being true. With only 32 digits in total and 4 players, the current bid of 4 9s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Given there are 32 total digits remaining, it's reasonable to assume there could be 5 0s. However, bidding higher on 0s is risky. I have two 5s in my hand, and previous bids suggest that higher digits are being played. Bidding 6 5s seems like a safe and strategic move, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of '6 5s'. In my hand, I have only one 5 (in 41256689). For the bid of '6 5s' to be valid, there would need to be at least 5 more 5s among the other three players' hands. Each player has 8 digits, so the other players have 24 digits total. It's possible but somewhat unlikely that 5 of those 24 digits (about 21%) would be 5s. Looking at my own hand distribution, I have two 6s, which suggests I could make a bid of '6 6s' - keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit. This is a reasonable bid given I already contribute 2 of the 6s needed. The alternative is to challenge, but with 24 unknown digits among other players, there's a significant risk that 5 more 5s exist. I'll make the safer play and bid higher.

Player 3 Reasoning: I only have one 6 in my hand, so there must be at least five 6s among the other 24 unknown digits to make the bid of 6 6s true. The probability of that is under 10%, making the bid very unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand, which guarantees at least three 9s in total. If anyone challenges my bid, they will lose for sure. This forces the next bidder to raise the quantity to four of some digit, giving me the advantage to challenge an unlikely four-of-a-kind later.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 3. I have the digits 2, 5, 0, 9, 0, 7, 3, 0 in my hand, which means I have 3 zeros and 1 nine. Given that there are only 24 digits in total and 3 players left, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. The current bid of 3 9s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. Since I have 1 nine and 3 zeros, bidding 4 0s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Given that there are 24 digits remaining, it's plausible that there are at least 4 0s among the three players. However, bidding 5 0s seems risky as I only have one 0. Challenging the bid of 4 0s is also risky, as it's likely that there are at least 4 0s among the three players. Bidding 4 1s is a safe option, as I have one 1 in my hand and it's reasonable to assume there are at least three other 1s among the remaining players.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. The current bid is 4 1s, but bidding 4 9s is valid (same quantity, higher digit) and requires only one additional 9 among the 16 unknown digits. The probability of at least one 9 in 16 unknown is about 81.5%, making this a strong bid that will likely hold if challenged and forces the next player to raise the quantity.

Given that there are only 24 digits in total and 3 players, I should assess the likelihood of there being at least 4 9s. Since I only have 1 nine and there are 2 other players, it's possible but seems unlikely that they have 3 nines in total. However, my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge. I can see that bidding higher than 4 9s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 5 0s seems reasonable as I have 3 zeros.
