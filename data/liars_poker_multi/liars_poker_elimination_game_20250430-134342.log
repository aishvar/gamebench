Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first bid of the round. I have one 3, one 4, two 7s, one 6, one 8, and one 9 in my hand. Bidding 1 9s is a reasonable starting bid, as I have a 9 and it's a relatively high digit. It's not overly aggressive.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, which already confirms the current bid of '1 9s' is valid. Since I know there are at least two 9s total, I can safely bid '2 9s'. This is a conservative increase that builds on my certain knowledge, while leaving room for future strategic moves.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8. The bid of 2 9s is relatively low, and it's plausible that there are at least two 9s among the 6 players. I have one 9, so at least one other player would need to have a 9. Given my hand and the low bid, challenging is risky. I can make a slightly higher bid based on the digits I have in my hand. I have two 8s, two 7s, and one 9. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as it's a higher quantity than the current bid and I hold two 8s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. The bid is not very high, and I can safely increase the bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I do not have any 9s, but I can bid 3 9s, which is a valid higher bid with the same quantity but higher digit. This puts pressure on the next player while staying reasonable based on my hand and the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 55435015, which contains no 9s. The current bid is 3 9s by Player 3. With 48 total digits across 6 players, it's possible that there are at least 3 9s in play, especially since I have none, meaning they could be concentrated in other hands. Bidding higher is safer than challenging at this low quantity. I have three 5s in my hand, so bidding 4 5s feels reasonable as I contribute significantly to that count. However, since 5 is lower than 9, I must increase the quantity to make a valid higher bid. Therefore, I will bid 4 0s to increase the digit while keeping the quantity slightly higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s, which is quite high but still possible given 48 total digits. Looking at my hand, I have one 0, so I cannot realistically support a bid higher than 4 0s. Challenging the bid is risky because the total number of 0s across all players could be at least 4, especially considering other players' bids with high counts of 9s and 8s. Since the bid is already quite high and my hand only has one 0, raising the bid further is unlikely. Therefore, challenging seems the best move to test the validity of the bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet in this round and I am starting the bidding, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand is 55435015, which includes three 5s. Bidding 3 5s is a safe starting point as I already contribute three to the total count, and with 40 total digits across 5 players, it's plausible that there could be at least three 5s. This bid also leaves room for others to raise the quantity or digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Player 4 bid 3 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. Given the previous round where a bid of 4 0s was successful, and we are now at 40 total digits, a bid of 3 5s seems plausible. However, I don't want to increase the quantity significantly without more information. I can bid 3 6s, which is the same quantity but a higher digit. This is a reasonable increase without being overly aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (80896933). The current bid of '3 6s' seems reasonable given there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total digits). Since I have one 6, there only need to be two more 6s among the other 32 digits held by other players to make this bid valid. Given the moderate bid level and my hand knowledge, I'll make a slightly higher bid. Moving to '4 6s' would be too aggressive since I only have one, so I'll keep the quantity at 3 but increase the digit to 8s, which I have two of in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains two 8s. The current bid is 3 8s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected number of any digit is around 4 (40 / 10). A bid of 3 8s is plausible, especially since I have two of them. Bidding 4 8s seems like a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity based on my hand strength in 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand, which gives some support but not strong evidence for a higher quantity of 8s. The next valid bids must be either quantity 5 of any digit or 4 of a digit higher than 8. Considering the rarity of 8s and the total digits 40, bidding 5 0s (the lowest digit) might be plausible since 0s are common. I have one 0 in my hand, which supports this bid. Bidding 5 0s increases quantity and is a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:5 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 55435015, which contains two 5s, one 0, and no 8s. The current bid is 5 0s by Player 3. I only have one 0 in my hand, which means I need at least 4 more 0s among the other 32 digits to make this bid valid. Given that there are 40 total digits across 5 players, the average number of any digit should be around 4. However, the bidding history shows aggressive bids on other digits like 8s and 9s, which might indicate fewer 0s are present. Bidding higher, such as 6 0s or switching to another digit like 5s (where I have two), feels risky as it pushes the quantity even higher into unlikely territory. Since 5 0s is already at the edge of plausibility with my single 0, I believe challenging is the better option rather than escalating the bid further.

Player 4 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid in this round, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 55435015, which contains three 5s, making it my strongest digit. Bidding on 5s seems reasonable to start with a conservative bid. I will bid 3 5s, as it matches the count in my hand and is a safe opening bid with 32 total digits in play across 4 players. This leaves room for others to bid higher while not overextending early in the round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Player 4 bid 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Bidding 4 5s would be a reasonable increase in quantity, but it's risky. Bidding 3 6s would be a valid increase in digit. I have one 6, so it's plausible. However, given the history of challenges, and the relatively low total digit count (32), a high bid might be challenged. Increasing the digit seems safer than increasing the quantity significantly. I will bid 4 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 80896933, I have zero 5s. The current bid is 4 5s, meaning there need to be at least 4 fives among all 32 digits. While possible, this seems unlikely given: 1) I have none, 2) Previous rounds showed relatively low quantities were challenged, 3) No player has shown strong confidence in 5s in their earlier bids. With 4 players having 8 digits each, even if other players have some 5s, reaching 4 total seems improbable.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the expected count of any digit is around 2.4 (24/10).  A bid of 1 9s is very conservative and likely true.  Bidding 2 9s is a reasonable increase based on my hand and the probability. Bidding on a different digit with a quantity of 2 or more is also an option, but 2 9s is the most direct increase based on the current bid and my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 55435015, which contains no 9s. The current bid is 2 9s by Player 2. With a total of 24 digits across three players, it's possible that there are at least 2 9s in the combined hands, as I have none, leaving 16 digits unknown to me. Challenging now feels risky since the bid is relatively low and plausible. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. I have three 5s in my hand, so bidding 3 5s feels safe and is a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit is not applicable since 9 is higher than 5, but I can increase quantity). I’ll bid 3 9s to keep the digit high and test the waters, as it’s a minimal increase and still plausible.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the average count for any digit is 2.4. A bid of 4 9s seems plausible, but not certain. Given the bidding history, Player 0 might be pushing the 9s. I have two 7s and two 8s in my hand, which could support a higher bid on those digits. Bidding 5 of any digit is a significant jump from 4. Bidding 4 of a higher digit like 0 seems unlikely given the current bid is 4 9s. Bidding 5 0s or 5 1s is a possibility, but I have no 0s or 1s. Bidding 5 7s or 5 8s based on my hand seems too risky without more information. Challenging 4 9s is an option, but it's close to the expected range. I have one 9, and the other two players would need three more 9s combined. This is possible. Given the options, bidding 5 0s is the lowest possible higher bid by quantity, but I have no 0s. Bidding 5 1s is also possible but I have no 1s. Bidding 5 of a digit I have seems too aggressive. Challenging is a reasonable play here as 4 9s is pushing the odds slightly beyond 50% with 3 players and 24 digits.

Player 2 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round with 16 total digits between two players. My hand is 81778295. I have two 7s, two 8s, one 1, one 2, one 5, and one 9. A safe starting bid is usually based on the most frequent digit in your hand, or a slightly higher bid on a less frequent digit if you want to test the other player. I have two 7s and two 8s. Bidding 3 of either digit seems reasonable as a starting point, representing slightly more than my hand contains, which is a common strategy to gauge the opponent. Bidding 3 7s is a good starting point.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 55435015, which contains no 7s. The current bid by Player 2 is 3 7s, meaning there should be at least 3 sevens across the total 16 digits. Since I have 0 sevens, all 3 would need to be in Player 2's hand of 8 digits, which is possible but not highly likely (about a 37.5% chance if digits are random). However, I also have a strong hand with multiple 5s (three 5s). Bidding higher, such as 4 5s, leverages my own hand strength and is a safer move than challenging a bid that could plausibly be true. I’ll bid 4 5s to increase the quantity and shift to a digit I’m confident in.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5, two 7s, and two 8s in my hand. With only 16 total digits, a bid of 4 5s means Player 4 is claiming there are at least three 5s in their hand, which is plausible. I have two 7s and two 8s, which are strong digits for me. Bidding 4 7s is a higher bid than 4 5s and is supported by my hand. Bidding 4 8s is also an option, but 4 7s is a slightly safer increment.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 55435015, which contains two 5s, one 0, one 1, one 3, and three 4s. The current bid by Player 2 is 4 7s. I have no 7s in my hand, so I must assess the likelihood of there being at least 4 7s across the 16 total digits. With only 2 players left, and knowing my 8 digits, there are 8 unknown digits in Player 2's hand. The probability of Player 2 having at least 4 7s in their 8 digits seems low, as it would require half of their hand to be 7s. However, challenging is risky if they do have a strong hand of 7s. Alternatively, I can make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 4 7s, I can bid 4 8s or higher, or increase the quantity to 5 or more of any digit. My strongest digit is 4 with three in my hand, so bidding 5 4s might be plausible, assuming Player 2 has at least two 4s. But I already bid 4 5s earlier, and now moving to 5 4s might signal weakness. Given the risk, I think challenging the 4 7s bid is the better move, as it seems unlikely based on probability with only 8 unknown digits.
