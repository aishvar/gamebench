Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 81627998, which has two 9s and two 8s, giving me some strength in higher digits. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an initial bid should be conservative to avoid an early challenge. I will bid 3 8s, as I have two 8s myself, and it's plausible that at least one more 8 exists among the other 40 digits. This bid is also strategic as it sets a moderate baseline for others to build on.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 1, 5, 7, 0, 8, 1, 4, 9. Counting the 8s, I see only one 8. The current bid is 3 8s, which is already quite high. Given the total of 48 digits, it's unlikely that the total number of 8s across all players is 3 or more, especially since only one of my digits is an 8. Challenging now would be a reasonable move to test the bid's validity, as the likelihood of there being at least 3 eights among all players is very low.

Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 81627998, which contains three 9s and two 8s. Bidding on a digit I have a decent count of is a safe strategy to start. I’ll bid 4 9s, as I have three myself, and with 40 total digits across 5 players, it’s plausible that at least one more 9 exists among the other players’ hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 0's bid of 4 9s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (12248014), I don't have any 9s. This means all 4 claimed 9s would need to be in the other players' hands. With 4 other players having 8 digits each (32 total digits not in my hand), it's certainly possible there are 4 or more 9s. The probability isn't low enough to warrant a challenge. For my bid, I could bid 5 0s (I have one 0), 5 1s (I have one 1), 5 2s (I have two 2s), 5 4s (I have one 4), or 5 8s (I have one 8). Since I have two 2s, bidding on 2s gives me the best odds. I'll bid 5 2s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. Player 0 bid 4 9s before Player 2 bid 5 2s. Bidding higher than 5 2s is necessary. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 6 2s would be a reasonable bluff, but it's risky given I have no 2s. Bidding 5 3s is a valid higher bid. I have no 3s, so it's also a bluff, but slightly less risky than 6 2s as 3 is higher than 2. I will bid 5 3s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have one '3' in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since 5 is the quantity, the next possible bids could be 5 4s or higher quantity with any digit. I have one '6' and one '5' as well, so bidding 5 4s or 5 5s is reasonable. Bidding 5 4s is the smallest valid increment and safer. Therefore, I will bid 5 4s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. To make the current bid of 5 4s true would require 4 more 4s among the 32 unseen cards (only ~40% chance). Instead, bidding 5 5s needs just 3 more 5s among those 32 cards, which has about a 63% chance of being true, making it a safer raise than challenging.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 81627998, which contains two 8s and two 9s, but no 5s. The current bid is 5 5s by Player 5. Since there are 40 total digits across 5 players, a bid of 5 5s means that on average, each player would need to have 1 five in their hand. This seems plausible, but I have zero 5s, which slightly lowers the likelihood. However, challenging carries a high risk as it's not extremely unlikely. I will make a higher bid instead. I can bid 5 6s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have one 6 in my hand, so it's a reasonable bid to make without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (12248014), I have zero 6s. The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 0. There are 5 active players with 8 digits each, so 40 total digits. For there to be at least 5 6s, the other 4 players would need to have at least 5 6s among them, which is certainly possible. However, I notice the bidding pattern: everyone has been raising the digit (from 9s to 2s to 3s to 4s to 5s to 6s) while keeping the quantity at either 4 or 5. This suggests players might be bidding strategically rather than based on their actual hands. Since I have zero 6s and would need to either increase to 6 6s or switch to a higher digit, I'll bid 5 7s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. While I could challenge, the previous rounds show players are willing to bid aggressively even with unlikely scenarios. Bidding 6 7s would be a reasonable increase, and I have no information to suggest 5 7s is impossible. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have, like 2 9s, but that doesn't leverage the existing bid. I'll stick with increasing the quantity of the current digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Since the total digits are 40, having at least six 7s is plausible but somewhat high. To continue, I need to bid higher than 6 7s. The next valid bids could be 6 8s or 7 0s (since digit 7 is maxed out at quantity 6). I have one 6 in my hand but that does not help for 8s or 0s. Bidding 6 8s is a small increment and reasonable considering the previous bids. Therefore, I will bid 6 8s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand, so all 6 must be among the other 32 cards. The expected number of 8s there is only about 3.2 and the probability of 6 or more is very low. This bid is unlikely to be true, so I should challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three zeros in my hand. With 32 total digits and an expected 3.2 zeros from the other players, the total zeros should average about 6.2. Bidding 5 zeros is a strong yet conservative opening that leverages my holding while leaving room to adjust.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 81627998, and I have no 0s. The current bid is 5 0s by Player 5. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 5 0s means that on average, each player would need about 1.25 0s in their hand. Since I have zero 0s, the other three players would need to have all 5 among them, which is possible but not highly likely given the random distribution of digits. However, challenging carries a risk of elimination if I'm wrong. Looking at the bidding history, Player 5 has been conservative in previous bids, and with only 32 digits total, 5 0s is plausible. I’ll play it safe and make a higher bid instead. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 5 9s feels reasonable as it increases the digit while maintaining the quantity, and it aligns with my strong holding in 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '5 9s'. Looking at my hand (12248014), I don't have any 9s. With 32 total digits in play and 4 active players (including me), there are 24 digits in other players' hands. For the bid of '5 9s' to be valid, at least 5 of those 24 digits would need to be 9s. This is possible but not certain. The probability is roughly 5/24 ≈ 21% per digit, making 5+ nines somewhat unlikely but not impossible. Since I'm not extremely confident in challenging, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 2s in my hand, which gives me some confidence in bidding on 2s. I'll bid '6 2s', which is higher than '5 9s' because of the increased quantity.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. I have no 2s in my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s by Player 5. In my hand of 81627998, I have no 0s. With only 24 total digits across three players, a bid of 3 0s means that the other two players would need to have at least 3 0s combined. Given that 0s might not be evenly distributed, this bid seems plausible but not overly high. I’ll make a higher bid instead of challenging. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 3 9s feels safe as it’s a higher digit with the same quantity. This keeps the pressure on the other players while staying within a reasonable range based on my own hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 81627998, which contains three 9s. The current bid by Player 3 is 5 9s, meaning they are claiming there are at least five 9s across both our hands (16 total digits). Since I have three 9s, Player 3 must have at least two 9s for the bid to hold. With only 8 digits in their hand, it's possible but not guaranteed. However, given the bidding history where Player 3 has been aggressive with bids on 9s (previously bidding 4 9s and winning), it's likely they have a strong count of 9s. Challenging now carries a high risk of losing since the total could easily be 5 or more. Instead, I can make a higher bid. I'll bid 6 9s, as it's a plausible increase and keeps the pressure on Player 3 to either challenge or bid higher. This also leverages my strong count of 9s.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 81627998, which contains three 9s. The current bid by Player 3 is 7 9s, and with only 16 total digits in play across both hands, this bid seems quite high. Since I have three 9s, Player 3 would need to have at least four 9s in their hand of eight digits for the bid to hold true, which is possible but not highly likely (probability of 4 or more 9s in their hand is relatively low given random distribution). However, challenging carries a risk—if they do have four or more 9s, I lose. On the other hand, bidding higher, such as 8 9s, would be even riskier as it’s closer to the maximum possible count. Given the history of Player 3’s aggressive bidding (e.g., previous successful bid of 4 9s when there were more players), I suspect they might be bluffing now with fewer digits in play. I’ll take the risk and challenge.
