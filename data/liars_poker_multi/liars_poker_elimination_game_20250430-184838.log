Player 0 Reasoning: As the starting player, there is no existing bid to challenge. The optimal opening bid is typically a quantity of 1 for the highest digit I hold in greatest abundance, to minimize risk and maximize flexibility. My hand contains two 7s, one 9, one 8, one 1, one 7, one 0, and one 6. Since I have two 7s, starting with '2 7s' is reasonable and slightly aggressive, leveraging my hand's strength.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have the hand 74731360, which contains two 7s. This means there are at least 2 7s in my hand, supporting the current bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I have a 7, I can reasonably assume there might be more 7s or higher digits across all hands. Bidding 3 7s increases the quantity and seems like a reasonable next step.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, so to make a bid of 3 8s I only need one more among the other 40 digits, which is very likely given an expected 4 8s. Bidding 3 8s is strictly higher than 3 7s by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, minimizing risk.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. My hand is 78282894, which contains three 8s. Since I alone meet the quantity of the current bid, challenging is not an option as the bid is guaranteed to be true. I must make a higher bid. Options include bidding 3 9s or increasing the quantity, such as 4 0s, 4 1s, etc. Given that I hold three 8s, bidding 4 8s is a very safe and strong move. There are 40 unknown digits among the other 5 players, and statistically, we'd expect about four more 8s (40/10). Needing only one more 8 from the remaining 40 digits makes 4 8s highly probable.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. Based on the current bid 4 8s from Player 3, I should challenge the bid because it seems unlikely that there are at least 4 8s in total.

Player 3 Reasoning: As the first bidder this round, I need to establish an opening bid. My hand is 78282894, containing three 8s, which is my strongest digit. With 40 total digits across 5 players, the expected average count for any digit is 4. Given I hold three 8s myself, bidding 4 8s is statistically very likely to be true, as it only requires one additional 8 among the other 32 digits held by the remaining players. This bid leverages my hand's strength and sets a reasonable starting point for the bidding.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 8s in my hand (18042821). With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.  A bid of 4 8s is exactly the average. Given that the previous round showed a high count of 8s (9), it's plausible that there are still a significant number of 8s among the remaining players. Bidding 5 8s is a slight increase but still within the realm of possibility, especially considering my hand.  Challenging 4 8s seems risky given the recent history and my own hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand (71981706), I have two 8s. With 5 players and 40 digits total, the current bid is 5 8s. I estimate that if I have 2 of the 8s, the remaining 32 digits are distributed among the other 4 players. Statistically, each digit should appear about 4 times (32/8 = 4), so it's plausible that there are at least 3 more 8s among the remaining players. Since 5 8s is not an unreasonable bid, I will not challenge. I will make a higher bid by increasing the quantity to 6 8s, since I have a relatively strong hand in 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I have the hand 74731360, which contains one 8. Given that there are 40 total digits and I have one 8, it's possible that the count of 8s is around 6 or slightly higher, but not extremely likely to be much higher. However, challenging seems risky without a strong basis to believe it's a lie. I can bid higher than 6 8s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since my hand doesn't have many high digits, increasing the quantity to 7 8s seems more reasonable than switching to a higher digit. Thus, bidding 7 8s is a safer choice.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I need to make the first bid. My hand is 74731360, which contains three 7s and one 3. A reasonable starting bid could be based on my hand. Since I have three 7s, bidding '3 7s' seems like a good starting point as it reflects the information I have.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. There are 32 total digits. The expected average count for any digit is 3.2, making 3 7s a plausible bid. I have one 7 in my hand (78282894), meaning there need to be at least two more 7s among the other 24 digits for the bid to be true. This is statistically quite possible, so challenging seems risky. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 3 8s, 3 9s, or 4 of any digit. I have three 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s is extremely safe but doesn't advance the bidding much. Bidding 4 8s requires only one more 8 among the remaining 24 digits held by the other three players. Given that I hold three 8s already, and the previous rounds showed high counts of 8s (9 and then 8), it's highly probable that there is at least one more 8 among the other players. Bidding 4 8s is a strong, likely true bid based on my hand and game history.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 18042821. I have two 8s. The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 3. With 32 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 3.2 (32 / 10).  The previous round saw a bid of 7 8s win, and the actual count was 8. While 4 8s is slightly above the average, the history suggests 8s are prevalent. Given I have two 8s, and the previous round's high count of 8s, bidding 5 8s seems like a reasonable and safe increase.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 5 8s, which is not unreasonable given 32 digits in play. In the previous round, there were 8 actual 8s with 40 digits, so a similar or slightly lower count is likely now. Challenging at 5 8s is risky since it's quite plausible. To stay in the game, I will make a minimal higher bid by increasing the digit to 9, resulting in a bid of 5 9s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have the hand 74731360, which contains no 9s. Given that there are 32 total digits and my hand has none of the digit 9, it's possible that the other players have a significant number of 9s, but it's still a relatively high bid. I need to either make a higher bid or challenge. Since my hand has a total of 3 sevens, and I previously bid 3 7s, I can consider bidding higher. Bidding 5 0s or higher quantity with a lower digit or the same quantity with a higher digit (which is not possible since 9 is the highest digit) could be an option. I will bid 6 8s as it is a higher quantity than 5 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s by Player 1. I hold three 8s in my hand (78282894). There are 32 total digits among 4 players. For the bid to be true, there need to be at least 3 more 8s among the other 24 digits held by Player 0, Player 1, and Player 5. Given the bidding history (Player 5 bid 5 8s, Player 1 bid 6 8s, and I previously bid 4 8s) and the revealed counts in previous rounds (9 8s in 48 digits, 8 8s in 40 digits), it seems plausible that there are at least six 8s in total. Challenging seems risky. My best option is to make a higher bid. I have three 8s, which is a strong holding for the current digit being bid. Bidding 7 8s requires four more 8s among the other 24 digits. Considering Player 5 bid 5 8s and Player 1 bid 6 8s, it's likely they hold several 8s between them. Bidding 7 8s leverages my hand and the established bidding pattern for 8s. An alternative like 6 9s is possible (based on Player 0's 5 9s bid and my one 9), but relies more heavily on Player 0's hand, whereas 7 8s is supported by multiple players' bids and my own strong holding.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 18042821. I have two 8s. The current bid is 7 8s. With 4 players and 32 total digits, the average count for any digit is 3.2.  A bid of 7 8s is significantly higher than average and implies a high concentration of 8s among the other players.  While it's possible, the probability of at least 7 8s existing out of 32 total digits, given I have two, seems low enough to warrant a challenge, especially considering the previous challenge on 7 8s resulted in an actual count of 8. However, the actual count was 8 last time, meaning 7 8s is plausible.  Looking at the bids, Player 0 bid 5 9s, which is a higher value than 7 8s. I have no 9s. Bidding higher on 8s would require a quantity of at least 8, which is risky. Bidding on another digit, like a 1 or 2 (of which I have two each), would require a significantly higher quantity to beat 7 8s.  Given the history and my hand, challenging seems the most strategic move as 7 8s is a high bid relative to the total digits.

With only 24 digits in play and my holding two 8s, it's very likely that at least three 8s exist among all hands, so challenging is unwise. To make a higher bid, I could either increase the digit to 9 (since I have two 9s), bidding 3 9s, or increase the quantity to 4 8s. Since I have two 9s, bidding 3 9s is relatively safe, and it doesn't escalate the quantity yet, which is advantageous early in the round.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand is 74731360, which contains no 9s. Given that there are 24 digits in total among the three players and my hand has 8 digits with no 9s, the other two players have 16 digits. It's possible they have at least three 9s. I need to bid higher than 3 9s. The next possible bid could be 4 0s or 3 Xs where X > 9, but since X cannot be greater than 9, I'll consider increasing the quantity or bidding on a lower digit if I think it's more plausible. I see that I have multiple 7s and 3s, which might be relatively common. However, bidding on a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit is required. I can bid 4 0s as it's a higher quantity. I have one 0, so it's plausible others might have some as well.

The expected count per digit among 24 digits is about 2.4, so 4 1s is plausible but not certain. Since I have two 1s, it's risky to challenge now. I'll make a safe, strictly higher bid by increasing the digit to 2 (with the same quantity), as I have two 0s in my hand, making a bid of 4 2s reasonable.

However, the current bid of 4 2s is relatively conservative given the total number of digits is 24. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have no 2s in my hand, I should be cautious. Bidding 4 3s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Since there are 16 digits in total and I hold two of the 8s, there only needs to be one 8 in Player 5's hand for the bid to be valid. This is plausible, so challenging now is risky. The next valid bid would be 3 9s. I have two 9s in my hand, making this a safe and reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s by Player 0. My hand is 18042821. I have two 8s, two 1s, two 2s, one 0, and one 4. I have zero 9s. Since there are only 16 total digits, a bid of 3 9s means Player 0 is claiming they have at least three 9s or is bluffing. Given my hand has no 9s, and Player 0 has 8 digits, it's possible they have three 9s. However, statistically, 3 out of 8 digits being 9s is not overwhelmingly likely. A bid of 3 9s is a reasonable bid to make if you have one or two 9s and want to push the opponent. Since I have no 9s, I cannot confidently bid a higher quantity of 9s or a higher digit at the same quantity. Challenging 3 9s is a calculated risk. If Player 0 has 3 or more 9s, I lose. If they have 0, 1, or 2 9s, I win. Given the limited number of digits left and my lack of 9s, challenging seems like the best option to win this round.
