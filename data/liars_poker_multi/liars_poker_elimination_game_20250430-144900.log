Player 0 Reasoning: There are 48 digits remaining across 6 players. With no bids yet, I can start with a conservative but strategic bid. I have one 6 in my hand, so bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as a starting point, aiming to stay below the midpoint of possible total digits (24).

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 0. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 6, increasing the quantity to 4 or more might be risky without knowing others' hands. However, I can safely increase the digit. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit and I have a 7 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. The bid is quite low relative to the total digits (48) and the digit 7 is not rare. I can raise the bid by increasing the digit at the same quantity level. Bidding 3 8s is a valid and reasonable next bid, increasing the digit from 7 to 8 while keeping the quantity at 3.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I hold three 9s in my hand, which is a strong indication that there are at least three 9s in total. Since bidding 3 9s would be a valid higher bid than 3 8s, I should increase the digit to 9 while keeping the quantity at 3. This makes my bid plausible given my hand and is a logical next move to challenge the current bid without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand, so it's possible there are at least three 9s among all 48 digits, but I don't have enough information to challenge. I also have three 6s in my hand, which makes it likely there are at least four 6s in total. Bidding 4 6s is a safe way to increase the bid while leveraging my strong hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains two 8s. The current bid is 4 6s. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid since it maintains the same quantity (4) but uses a higher digit (8 > 6). This leverages my existing 8s and challenges the current bid without overcommitting.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 5. I have 8 secret digits: 7, 2, 3, 1, 3, 7, 9, 5. I see that I have two 7s and two 3s, but no 8s. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 8s, I will bid on a digit that I have. I have two 7s, so bidding 2 7s is not higher than 3 8s. However, I can bid on a higher digit than 8, which is 9. I have one 9, so I can bid 1 9s, but that's not higher than 3 8s. I will bid 4 3s because I have two 3s and it's a higher quantity than 3 8s is not guaranteed to be higher in terms of digit value but 4 is higher than 3.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 is a big jump without strong evidence. Increasing the digit to 4 while keeping the quantity at 4 is a safer increment. I have one 4 in my hand, so bidding 4 4s is reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s by Player 2. My hand contains 3, 4, 4, 3, 6, 9, 9, 9, giving me a total of 2 fours. Since the bid of 4 4s claims there are at least four fours in all hands, and I only have 2 fours, it's highly unlikely the total is 4 or more. Challenging now would be strategic, as the count of fours in my hand is low, and the previous bid is already quite high. Given the low count of fours in my hand and the current bid, I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 4s and two 5s in my hand, which suggests a decent presence of these digits. Since there are no bids yet this round, I want to start with a moderate bid that is believable and sets a baseline. Bidding 3 4s leverages the digits I have and is a reasonable starting point considering the total digits and players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s, meaning at least three 4s among all 32 digits. With only one 4 myself, and based on probability, it's very likely that at least two more 4s exist among the remaining 24 digits (3 other hands). Therefore, challenging is risky. Instead, I can make a safe higher bid based on my strong hand in 6s (three 6s) or 9s (two 9s). Bidding 3 6s increases the digit and matches my hand strength, but to be strictly higher, I must bid 3 5s or 4 4s. 3 5s is not attractive, and 4 4s is a repeat of a previously challenged bid. Alternatively, I can bid 3 5s, which is the next valid bid. However, with three 6s, bidding 3 6s is safer and strictly higher than 3 4s. Therefore, I will bid 3 6s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid since the digit is higher while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 5. I have 8s in my hand (one 8). Given that there are 3 other active players and each has 8 digits, the maximum possible 8s is 12 (3 players * 4 remaining 8s not counting mine). However, increasing the quantity seems risky without more information. I can increase the digit to make a higher bid. For example, bidding 3 9s would be higher because the digit is higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity to 4 with any digit or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit to 0 (since digits wrap from 9 back to 0 is not allowed, digit must be higher than 9, which is not possible). Therefore, I must increase the quantity to 4. I have two 5s and one 4 in my hand, so bidding 4 4s is plausible. Given the previous bids and my hand, bidding 4 4s is a reasonable and valid next bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. In my hand (76594466), I have two 4s. With 32 digits in play and only needing to bid higher than 4 4s, I can safely increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have three 6s in my hand, so bidding 4 6s is reasonable and keeps me in a strong position.

Given that there are 3 other active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total number of digits is 32. The bid of 4 8s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. I can see that bidding higher than 4 8s requires either a higher quantity or a higher digit. Since my hand contains a 9, which is a higher digit, I can bid 4 9s, increasing the digit while maintaining the quantity.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I must bid higher, either by increasing the quantity or the digit. I have one 9 in my hand, but the bid of 4 9s is already quite high given there are only 32 digits total. Increasing the quantity to 5 is a big jump and risky. Bidding 4 0s is valid and safer, as 0 is the lowest digit and the quantity remains the same. I have one 4 and one 8, but no 0s, so I rely on probability. Bidding 4 0s is a reasonable move to keep the game going without risking a challenge now.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, which makes the bid plausible but not certain. To raise the bid, I must increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. I have two 5s and two 4s, but those digits are lower than 9. The next valid bid after 4 9s would be 5 0s. Since I have no 0s, bidding 5 0s is risky but still possible given the total of 32 digits. Challenging 4 9s is risky because 4 9s is not an excessively high bid. Therefore, I will bid 5 0s to increase the quantity and keep the pressure on others.

On average, each digit appears about 3.2 times in the 32 digits, so a bid of 5 0s is above expectation. Given the statistical unlikelihood and my complete lack of 0s, I should challenge.

Given that there are 24 total digits and 3 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. The current bid of 3 8s seems plausible but not extremely high. I have one 8 in my hand, and if the other players have a reasonable distribution, 3 8s could be achievable. However, I can try to make a higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains two 7s and three 6s. The current bid is 4 7s. With only 2 of the 7s in my hand, there would need to be at least 2 more among the 16 digits held by the other two players. Statistically, that's plausible but not certain. However, since I have three 6s, and the previous round showed that higher quantities for common digits can hold up, I can safely make a higher bid by increasing the quantity and reverting to a digit I have in abundance. Therefore, I will bid 5 6s.

Since the maximum possible for any digit is 16, and the next legal bid is either 3 7s or 2 8s/9s, I'll check my hand for higher digits. I have two 6s, two 4s, one 5, one 7, one 9, and one 6. I have two 6s and two 4s, but only one 9 and no 8s. Bidding 3 7s is safe since I already have two and only need to hope Player 1 has one more. This is a reasonable, safe incremental bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s made by Player 4. I previously bid 2 7s. Given that there are 16 total digits and only 2 players left, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. Since I have two 7s in my hand and there are only 2 players, it's possible that Player 4 also has some 7s. However, bidding 4 7s would be a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity. But first, I should assess if challenging is more beneficial. Given that I do not have information about Player 4's hand and I have 2 7s, challenging seems risky. I will increase the bid to 4 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. In my hand (76594466), I have two 7s. For Player 1's bid to be valid, there must be at least two more 7s in their hand, which is possible but not guaranteed. Statistically, with 16 total digits and two already in my hand, the expected number of 7s in Player 1's hand is about 1.6. Bidding higher is risky since I have only two 7s, but challenging is also risky as 4 is plausible. However, given the even distribution and the fact that I hold two 7s, the likelihood that Player 1 has two or more 7s is low, so challenging is the best play.
