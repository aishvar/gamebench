Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. With 48 total digits, the expected count for any digit is about 4.8. Bidding 4 9s leverages my strong holding while remaining below the statistical average, making it a solid opening bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. I can bid 5 0s, which is a valid higher bid. Bidding 5 9s is also valid. I will bid 5 0s to be safe and increase the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (49488632), I don't have any 0s. Player 1 has bid 5 0s, which means they believe there are at least 5 zeros among all players. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. The average frequency of each digit would be 4.8, so 5 zeros is slightly above average but certainly possible. Even without any zeros in my hand, the other 5 players could easily have 5 or more zeros between them. I should make a higher bid. I have one 9, one 4, two 8s, one 6, one 3, and one 2 in my hand. I could bid 5 1s (same quantity, higher digit) or 6 0s (higher quantity). Since I don't have any 1s in my hand, I'll go with 5 1s as it's a safer bid that doesn't increase the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 01908217. I have two 0s, two 1s, one 2, one 7, one 8, and one 9. The current bid is 5 1s. I have two 1s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average number of any digit is 4.8. A bid of 5 1s is slightly above average. Given I have two 1s, it's plausible there are at least three more among the other 5 players. However, I also have two 0s. Bidding 6 0s is a stronger bid than 5 1s and is based on my hand strength in 0s. Bidding 6 1s is also an option but is riskier as I only have two 1s. Bidding 6 0s seems like a reasonable increase based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. I have no 0s in my hand, which makes me suspect that 7 0s is a risky bid. Statistically, with 48 digits and 10 possible digits, the expected number of 0s is about 4.8. Since I have 0, and assuming the distribution is roughly even, it's unlikely there are 7 or more 0s among the other 5 players (40 digits). The probability is low enough that challenging is the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round, I need to make an opening bid. My hand is 55529143, which contains three 5s, one 2, one 9, one 1, one 4, and one 3. With 5 players and 40 total digits, a conservative opening bid is ideal, typically a quantity of 4 or 5 of a digit I have multiples of. Since I hold three 5s, bidding 4 5s is a safe and credible start that puts pressure on others while being supported by my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, giving a strong base. With 32 unknown digits and an expected 3.2 more 9s, thereâ€™s over an 80% chance of at least two more, making 4 9s very likely. This strictly raises the digit while keeping quantity low.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the bid of 5 1s. In my hand, I have one 1 (in 49488632). With 5 players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits in play. Player 1 is claiming there are at least 5 ones among all players. I have 1, so there would need to be at least 4 more among the other 4 players. This is possible but not guaranteed. Given that Player 5 bid 4 5s and Player 0 bid 4 9s, they might have some of those digits in their hands. Since I need to make a higher bid, I could bid 5 2s or higher, or increase the quantity to 6 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, which gives me confidence to bid on 8s. I'll bid 5 8s, which is higher than 5 1s and I already know I have 2 of them.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:3 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains one 8. The current bid is 5 8s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. A bid of 5 8s is slightly above average, but not unreasonable, especially considering the previous bids in this round have escalated. Given my hand has one 8, I don't feel confident enough to challenge, as it's plausible others have 8s. I need to make a higher bid. I have two 0s, one 1, one 2, one 7, one 8, and two 9s. Bidding on 0s or 9s seems like a good option based on my hand. Bidding 6 0s is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have no 0s in my hand, so the probability of there being 6 or more 0s among the remaining 32 digits (held by 4 other players) is low, but not impossible. Statistically, each digit appears about 3-4 times per player, but zeros are less common in some decks. Since I have no 0s, and 6 is a relatively high bid, there is a good chance Player 3 is bluffing or overestimating. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first to bid this round, so I should open with a strong but reasonable bid based on my hand. My hand contains three 5s, which is the most frequent digit I have. Since there are 32 digits in play, starting with a bid of 3 5s is justifiable and not too aggressive, making it a safe opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, so only one more 9 is needed among the other 24 unknown digits to meet a bid of 3 9s. The probability of at least one 9 among 24 random digits is about 92%, making this a safe raise. It is a valid raise over 3 5s because the quantity is the same but digit 9 > 5.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. I could bid 4 0s, but I think it is more likely that there are at least four 9s in total, given that Player 0 just bid 3 9s. I will bid 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 1's bid of 4 9s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (49488632), I have one 9. Since there are 4 active players with 8 digits each (32 total digits), and Player 1 is claiming there are at least 4 nines total, this means there should be at least 3 more nines among the other three players. This is certainly possible, but not guaranteed. However, since I already have one 9, I'm less inclined to challenge. For my bid, I need to go higher than 4 9s. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, which gives me some confidence in bidding on 8s. I could bid 5 0s, 5 1s, etc., but I'll bid 5 8s since I have evidence for it in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. In my hand, I have no 8s (digits: 5,5,5,2,9,1,4,3). With four players and 32 digits in play, the expected average per digit is about 3.2. For there to be 5 or more 8s, the other three players would need to collectively hold at least 5 8s, which is above average and unlikely. Given that I have zero 8s and the bid is already above expectation, I believe this bid is unlikely to be valid and should be challenged.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am Player 5, starting the round with 8 digits: 55529143. I have three 5s and one 9, which are my strongest digits. Since it's the first bid of the round, I want to make a safe but credible bid based on my hand. Bidding 3 5s is strong because I hold three 5s myself, making it unlikely my opponent will challenge immediately. This also follows my previous successful strategy.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 55529143, which contains no 6s. The current bid is 4 6s, meaning there must be at least four 6s among the 16 total digits (my 8 and Player 1's 8). Since I have zero 6s, all four would have to be in Player 1's hand. The probability of Player 1 having exactly four or more 6s in a random hand of 8 digits is quite low.
