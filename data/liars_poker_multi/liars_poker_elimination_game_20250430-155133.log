Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand and with 48 digits total we expect about 4.8 of any face. Bidding 4 9s uses my strong holding while staying safely below the average, making it a solid opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have many high digits, I should consider bidding on a digit that is more likely to have a higher count. I have two 8s and two 7s, and bidding on 8s seems reasonable. Increasing the quantity to 5 or more 9s might be risky without knowing others' hands, but bidding 5 8s seems like a safer bet as it increases both quantity and digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains two 5s. The current bid is 5 8s. Bidding 6 5s increases the quantity while targeting a digit I hold, making it a plausible and defensible move. Since I have two 5s and there are 40 other digits, it's reasonable to assume at least four more 5s exist, totaling six. This bid is higher in quantity than the current bid and leverages my hand's composition.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I have zero 5s in my hand. Bidding higher than 6 5s is risky as it requires a significant number of 5s across other players' hands. Given the history of bids (4 9s, 5 8s, 6 5s), the bids are increasing, but 6 5s already seems relatively high. I will challenge, hoping Player 2 is bluffing. There are 48 total digits, and 6 5s represents a significant proportion.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: As the starting player, I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 5s. Bidding 3 5s is reasonable because I have two, and with four other players, it's likely there's at least one more 5 in their hands. This bid is conservative and sets a baseline for others to build upon or challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 25412846, which contains one 5. The current bid is 3 5s by Player 2, and with 5 active players, there are 40 total digits. Given that I only have one 5, and considering the previous round where the count of 5s was 7 with 6 players, it seems plausible that there could still be at least 3 5s across all hands now with 5 players. I think it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I’ll bid 4 6s since I have one 6 in my hand, increasing both the quantity and the digit to stay competitive.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 4. I have two 6s in my hand (63858111), so I know there are at least 2 6s. With 5 active players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in total. The bid of 4 6s is plausible, but I need to consider if it's likely or not. Since I have two 6s, there are 38 other digits. It's possible that there are at least 2 more 6s among the other players' hands, making the total count of 6s at least 4. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. I will increase the digit to 7s, as it's a relatively conservative move, and there's a chance others might have 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 7s in my hand. With 40 total digits and none in mine, the expected sevens among the other 32 digits is about 3.2, and the chance of seeing at least four is under 50%, so 4 7s is unlikely. I will challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold three 9s in my hand. With 24 unknown cards, the expected number of additional 9s is about 2.4, giving me over 90% confidence there are at least four 9s in total. Opening with 4 9s is a strong bid that also forces the next player to raise the quantity.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 0. I have 8 secret digits: 80682072. I see that I have one 9 in my hand. Considering the total digits remaining is 32 and there are 4 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. Given that I have one 9 and there are 3 other players, bidding 5 9s seems reasonable as it accounts for my 9 and potentially 4 more 9s among the other players.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:2 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains no 9s. The current bid of 5 9s requires at least five 9s across all hands. With 32 total digits and my hand having none, the remaining 24 digits must account for all 5. Given the low probability of 5 nines existing (especially with no 9s in my hand), challenging is a calculated risk. The expected number of 9s in 24 random digits is ~2.4, making 5 highly unlikely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: As the starting bidder, I need to make a reasonable bid based on my hand. My hand contains two 5s, and with 24 total digits, bidding 4 5s is plausible. This allows for two additional 5s in the other players' hands, which is likely given the total digits available. Starting with a moderate bid ensures I don't overcommit while leveraging my own digits.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:4 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 25412846, which contains one 5. The current bid by Player 2 is 4 5s out of a total of 24 digits across three players. Since I only have one 5, the other two players must collectively have at least 3 more 5s for the bid to be true. Given that each player has 8 digits, it's plausible that there are a few more 5s in the other hands, as 5s are not particularly rare. Bidding higher seems safer than challenging at this stage. I can bid 4 6s, as I have two 6s in my hand, which gives me some confidence in the digit, even though it's a slight increase in risk. This bid increases the digit while maintaining the quantity, adhering to the rules of a higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:0 - o4-mini-2025-04-16) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold three 9s in my hand, so to bid 4 9s I only need one more 9 among the 16 unknown cards. The probability of at least one 9 in 16 cards is about 1–0.9^16 ≈ 81.5%, which is higher than the ~78.8% chance of the current bid of 4 6s being false. Bidding 4 9s is strictly higher than 4 6s (same quantity, higher digit) and puts pressure on the next player to bid 5 of something unlikely or challenge me. This maximizes my chance of winning the round.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:2 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s by Player 0. My hand contains no 9s, and with only 24 total digits remaining (16 in opponents' hands), achieving 4 9s requires at least 4 of the 16 digits to be 9s. While possible, this feels unlikely given my hand and the game history of successful challenges on similar bids. Challenging forces verification and risks elimination only if the bid is valid, which I doubt.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains two 5s. With 16 total digits remaining and two players, bidding 3 5s is a reasonable starting point. I have two 5s, so even if the opponent has one, the total would be three, making the bid likely true. This is a conservative bid that balances my known digits with the need to initiate the round.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:4 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 25412846, which contains one 5. The current bid by Player 2 is 3 5s across the total 16 digits in play. Since I only have one 5, the other 2 must be in Player 2's hand for the bid to be true. Given that there are 8 digits in their hand, it's possible but not highly likely they have exactly two 5s. However, since the bid is relatively low compared to the total digits, I think it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 4 6s feels reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit, and I can support part of the count myself.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand contains one 6, so Player 4 would need at least three 6s in their hand for the bid to be true. Given the low probability of Player 4 having three 6s in their 8-digit hand (estimated ~3.3% chance), challenging is highly favorable. The bid is likely false, making a challenge the optimal move.
