Player 0 Reasoning: There are 48 digits remaining and 6 players in the game. The current bid is 'None', so I need to make a valid higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable as a starting point, as it's likely there are at least three 7s among all players' hands.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding 4 7s is a valid option, but it's risky as I only know of one 7 in my hand. Bidding a different digit seems safer. I have two 2s, one 5, one 6, one 9 and two 0s. Bidding 4 0s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have two 0s. Bidding 3 9s is also possible. Since 0 is a more common number, 4 0s seems like a better choice than 3 9s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand (the last digit). With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. Player 1 claims there are at least 4 zeros. Given I only see one 0 in my hand, and zeros are generally less common than other digits, this seems like a reasonable bid but not worth challenging yet. I can make a safe bid of 4 1s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) based on the probabilities.

Player 3 Reasoning: I hold two 8s in my hand. Since the current bid of 4 1s can be beaten by either increasing the quantity or bidding the same quantity with a higher digit, 4 8s is a logical bid. The total number of 8s across all hands could reasonably reach 4 given their higher frequency in my hand and the statistical distribution of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 26760040, which contains no 8s. The current bid is 4 8s by Player 3. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits, a bid of 4 8s is plausible as it represents less than 10% of the total digits. I don't have any 8s myself, which slightly lowers the likelihood from my perspective, but it's still within a reasonable range. Challenging now might be risky as the bid isn't excessively high. Instead, I can make a higher bid. I have two 0s in my hand, so bidding on 0s could be a safe move. Since the current bid is 4 8s, I can bid 5 0s to increase the quantity. This bid leverages my own hand strength and pushes the total slightly higher, which might pressure others to challenge or bid higher.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. In my hand, I have one 0. With 48 digits in play, the expected number of any digit is around 4.8. The bid of 5 0s is slightly above expectation, but not unreasonable, especially this early. Since I have only one 0, I am not comfortable challenging yet. Instead, I will make a higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, choosing 5 1s, as I have one 1 in my hand and it pushes the action forward.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have two 9s in my hand, which is a high digit. Bidding 6 9s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit. Additionally, I have seen multiple high bids, suggesting that players might have high digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Given the previous bids and the number of players, 6 9s seems plausible, but not overwhelmingly so. I could bid higher, but I don't have many strong digits. I have two 6s, two 2s, one 7, one 5 and one 0. Bidding 7 0s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have one 0. Bidding 6 6s is also possible, but less of an increase. I'll opt for the 7 0s bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (48398520), I have one 0. The current bid of '7 0s' means Player 1 thinks there are at least 7 zeros total among all 48 digits. Given that I only see one 0 in my hand, and players have been making relatively conservative bids, 7 zeros seems quite high. While it's theoretically possible (as there could be 6 more zeros among the other 40 digits), the escalating bid pattern and my hand knowledge suggests this might be a bluff. The previous bid of '6 9s' was already aggressive, and '7 0s' pushes it further. I think challenging is safer than making a higher bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 0, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 8, and two 9s in my hand. Since I'm starting the round and have two 9s, I can be confident about bidding those. Given 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total), and knowing I have two 9s, starting with a conservative bid of 3 9s seems reasonable. This leaves room for escalation while being fairly safe based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The expected count for any digit across 40 digits is 4, making 4 8s a statistically reasonable bid. Since the current bid (3 9s) is likely valid (average 9s expected is ~4), challenging risks elimination. Bidding 4 8s leverages my hand's 8s and aligns with probabilistic expectations.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s by Player 3. In my hand, I have no 8s, which means I contribute nothing to this count. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, an average of 4 of each digit is expected across all hands. A bid of 4 8s is exactly at this average, but since I have zero 8s, it slightly increases the likelihood that the total count might be lower than bid. However, it's still plausible that other players have enough 8s to meet or exceed this bid. Bidding higher, such as 5 0s, seems reasonable since I have two 0s in my hand, contributing to the count, and it increases the quantity. This bid feels safer than challenging a bid that is statistically possible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. In my hand (64761289), I have zero 0s, which makes it less likely that there are 5 or more 0s among the 32 other digits. However, since there are 5 players and 40 digits, and 0s are generally rare, the bid is plausible but not strongly supported by my hand. Challenging is risky but reasonable given I have no 0s. However, it is relatively early in the round and a safe higher bid is possible. I have two 6s and two 8s. I will bid 5 6s, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit, supported by my own hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 5 6s. Given that there are 40 digits remaining and 5 players, it's plausible that there could be 5 6s. However, bidding higher on 6s is risky. I could bid 6 7s, as I have one 7 in my hand, but this is also risky. Challenging the current bid of 5 6s seems like the best option, as it's likely that the actual count is less than 5.

Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand, I have zero 9s. The current bid of '1 9s' is very low considering we're at 32 total digits. Given my hand has an 8, I can confidently bid '1 8s' which maintains the same quantity but uses a different digit that I know exists.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 26760040, which contains two 0s, one 2, one 4, one 6, and two 7s. The current bid is 2 9s made by Player 3. I have no 9s in my hand, so I must estimate the likelihood of there being at least two 9s across all 32 digits. Given that there are 4 players with 8 digits each, it's plausible that there are at least two 9s in play, as each player could have some. Looking at the bidding history, Player 0 bid 1 9s, and Player 3 raised it to 2 9s, which suggests they might have at least one 9. Since the bid is low (only 2), challenging seems risky as it's likely to be met. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. I have two 0s, so bidding 3 0s feels safe and increases both the quantity and the digit from 2 9s. This bid leverages my hand strength and keeps the game moving.

Bidding 4 0s seems reasonable as I already have three 0s, and it's likely that at least one more 0 exists among the other 16 digits held by Player 2 and Player 3.

Given that Player 4 made this bid and likely has at least one 0, and there's still Player 3 who might have some, this seems plausible. Looking at bid history, Player 4 has been relatively honest (won a challenge with 5 0s earlier). I should make a higher bid. Since I have two 8s in my hand, bidding 4 8s is a reasonable move as it keeps the same quantity but uses a higher digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 26760040, which contains three 0s. The current bid is 4 9s by Player 3. I have no 9s in my hand, so I must assess the likelihood of there being at least four 9s across all 24 digits. With three players and 8 digits each, it's possible but not highly likely, as it would require at least four 9s in the remaining 16 digits from the other two players. However, since I have a strong count of 0s, I can safely bid higher by increasing the quantity to 5 0s, leveraging my own hand strength. This avoids the risk of challenging a potentially valid bid and keeps me in the game with a reasonable bid.

Additionally, Player 4's previous bid pattern (starting with 4 0s then raising to 5 0s) could indicate uncertainty. Given that I can see only 1 zero and would need 4 more among just 16 remaining unknown digits, I should challenge.
