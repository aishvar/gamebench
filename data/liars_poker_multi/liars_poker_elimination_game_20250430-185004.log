Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in the round. My hand is 27049626, which contains two 2s and two 6s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, bidding 3 of a digit I have two of is a reasonable and conservative starting bid, reflecting my hand strength while being plausible for the total count.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. To meet a bid of 3 3s I need only one more among the other 40 cards. With an expected ~2.8 threes in the unknown cards, this is very likely. It's a minimal valid raise over 3 2s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have three 0s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of this bid. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or the digit. Raising the digit while keeping the quantity at 4 is a valid move. Since 0 is the lowest digit, bidding 4 2s is a reasonable next step, as it increases the digit and maintains a believable quantity given my hand and the total digits.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits: 64338137. I can see that I have two 3s, one 6, one 4, one 8, and three 1s and 7s are not present but 2 is not present in my hand. Given that there are 40 total digits and 5 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Since my hand contains no 2s, I must assess the likelihood of there being at least 4 2s in total. Given that each player has 8 digits, there could be a maximum of 5 * 8 = 40 digits. If 2s are distributed evenly or sparsely, 4 2s seem plausible but not certain. However, I do not have enough information to accurately gauge the number of 2s. I should make a bid that is higher than 4 2s. I can bid 4 3s because I have two 3s and it's a higher digit than 2.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. There are 5 players and 40 total digits, so the expected average quantity for any digit is 4. The bid of 4 3s is exactly the average, making a challenge risky. I have one '3' in my hand (72803749). To make a higher bid, I should consider my strongest digits. I have two '7's. Bidding 4 7s would be a safe next step (requiring only 2 more 7s from the other 32 digits). However, bidding 5 7s leverages my strong hand in 7s and increases the pressure. It requires 3 more 7s from the other 32 digits, which is plausible (slightly above the expected 3.2). This seems like a strong bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s, made by Player 5. There are 5 active players with a total of 40 digits. My hand contains one 7. For the bid of 5 7s to be true, the other 4 players must collectively hold at least 4 additional 7s among their 32 digits. The expected number of 7s in 32 random digits is 3.2 (32 * 0.1). The probability of having 4 or more 7s in 32 digits is approximately 38.3%. This means there is a roughly 61.7% chance that the other players have less than 4 7s, making the total count of 7s less than 5. Challenging the bid offers a higher probability of winning (approx. 61.7%) compared to the bid being true (approx. 38.3%) or making a higher bid that is likely to be challenged.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round with 4 active players and 32 total digits. The expected average count for any digit is 3.2 (32/10). My hand is 72803749, containing two 7s. This is above the average representation for a single hand. Given my two 7s, bidding slightly above the expected average seems reasonable and leverages my hand's strength. A bid of '4 7s' requires only two more 7s among the other 24 digits held by the remaining 3 players, which is statistically plausible (expected 2.4 7s in those 24 digits). This is a solid opening bid based on my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 7s in my hand. With 32 total digits the expected number of 7s is about 3.2 and requiring at least 4 is unlikely (≈22% chance). Given this low probability and Player 5’s aggressive history, it’s optimal to challenge now.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round with 3 players and 24 total digits. My hand is 72803749. The expected number of any digit is 24/10 = 2.4. I have two 7s, which is my strongest digit. However, I won the last two rounds bidding relatively high on 7s (5 7s with 40 digits, 4 7s with 32 digits), and both bids were challenged. Bidding on 7s again might attract immediate suspicion or seem predictable. A safer strategy is to open with a bid based on another digit. I have one 9. The expected total number of 9s is 2.4. Bidding '2 9s' is statistically reasonable (1 in my hand + 1.6 expected in the other 16 digits = 2.6 > 2). This is a safe opening bid, uses a high digit which forces the next bid to be at least '3 0s', and avoids focusing on my 7s immediately.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have three 9s in my hand (positions 4, 6, and 7). Given there are 24 digits total among all players, having at least 3 nines is quite plausible. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the quantity is low, I will increase the quantity to 3 but keep the digit at 0, which is the lowest digit and thus a valid higher bid after 2 9s. This is a safe and reasonable bid based on my hand.

Given that there are 24 total digits remaining and 3 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. The current bid of 3 0s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. Since I only have one 0, I will not bid on 0. I will look for another digit to bid on. I have two 3s, and there are 24 digits in total, so bidding on 3 seems reasonable. I will bid 2 3s as a starting point, considering I have two 3s and it's a low bid to test the waters.

However, I can try to make a bid. I notice Player 3's bid is 3 0s, so I need a higher quantity or a higher digit. Since my hand contains two 6s, bidding on 6 seems reasonable.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 4. My hand is 72803749, which contains zero 6s. This means for the bid to be true, the other two players (Player 3 and Player 4) must hold at least three 6s between their 16 digits. While this is slightly above the expected average (2.4 total, 1.6 in the remaining 16 digits), a bid of 3 is relatively low and could plausibly be true, making a challenge risky. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires only one additional 7 among the other 16 digits held by Player 3 and Player 4, which is highly probable. Therefore, bidding 3 7s is a safe and strong move based on my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand.

Increasing the digit to 8 while keeping the quantity at 3 is a cautious move that maintains pressure on the next player.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 3. I have the hand 64338137, which contains two 3s, one 6, one 8, and other digits. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I first assess the likelihood of the current bid. With 24 total digits remaining across 3 players, and given that each player has 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 24. The bid of 3 8s seems plausible but not extremely high. I have one 8 in my hand, and it's possible that the other players have enough 8s to make this bid true. However, I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity or the digit. I will bid 4 6s because I have one 6 in my hand, and it's a reasonable increase in quantity while choosing a digit that could potentially add up across players' hands.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 4. I have zero 6s in my hand (72803749). For the bid to be true, the other two players (Player 3 and Player 4) must have at least four 6s combined in their 16 digits. Player 4 previously bid 3 6s and then escalated to 4 6s, suggesting they might hold some 6s, making a challenge somewhat risky. I need to make a higher bid: either quantity 5+ or quantity 4 with a digit higher than 6 (7, 8, or 9). My hand contains two 7s, one 8, and one 9. Bidding 4 7s is a natural next step, as I previously bid 3 7s in this round and have two 7s in my hand. This requires only two more 7s among the other 16 digits, which is plausible (expected number is 1.6). Bidding 4 8s (requires 3 more) or 4 9s (requires 3 more) is riskier based on my hand. Bidding 5 of anything is a significant jump. Therefore, bidding 4 7s is the most strategically sound move, leveraging my hand's strength and putting pressure on the next player.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand contains two 7s, which supports the plausibility of the bid but does not guarantee it. To make a valid higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. The next higher digit after 7 is 8, so bidding 4 8s is a valid move. Since 4 7s is not an extremely high bid given the total digits (24), and I have some 7s myself, challenging now is risky. Therefore, I will bid 4 8s to keep the game going with a reasonable increase.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s by Player 4. I have zero 6s in my hand (72803749). This means the other 16 digits held by Player 3 and Player 4 must contain at least five 6s. Player 4 has consistently increased their bid on 6s this round (3 6s -> 4 6s -> 5 6s), suggesting they likely hold multiple 6s (perhaps 2 or 3). While 5 is a significant number out of 24 total digits, Player 4's bidding makes a challenge risky. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 5 7s, 5 8s, 5 9s, or increasing the quantity to 6. I have two 7s, one 8, and one 9. Bidding 5 7s requires three more 7s from the other 16 digits. Bidding 5 8s requires four more 8s. Player 3 previously bid 4 8s, strongly suggesting they hold multiple 8s (likely 2 or 3). If Player 3 holds three 8s and I hold one, that totals four 8s. We would only need one more 8 from Player 4's hand. This makes 5 8s a plausible bid that leverages Player 3's likely hand and puts the pressure back on them. It's a safer and more strategically sound bid than challenging or bidding on my own 7s again.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s made by Player 4. There are 24 total digits among the 3 active players. I have zero 6s in my hand (72803749). This means the remaining 16 digits held by Player 3 and Player 4 must contain at least six 6s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 6s in those 16 digits is 16 * 0.1 = 1.6. Requiring 6 or more is statistically unlikely (significantly above the expected value). Player 4 has escalated bids on 6s (3 6s, 4 6s, 5 6s, 6 6s), which could indicate a strong hand or a bluff. However, given my lack of 6s, the probability strongly suggests the actual count is less than 6. Making a higher bid (e.g., 6 7s based on my two 7s) is possible but still requires 4 sevens from the other 16 digits, which is also unlikely. Challenging the 6 6s bid appears to be the most statistically sound move.

A bid of '3 7s' requires Player 3 to have at least one 7 among their 8 digits. The probability of Player 3 having at least one 7 is approximately 1 - (0.9)^8 ≈ 57%. This makes '3 7s' a reasonably safe but more aggressive opening bid than '2 7s'. Starting with '3 7s' leverages my hand's strength and puts moderate pressure on Player 3.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s by Player 5. Since I have two 7s, it is plausible that there are at least 3 7s in total, but raising the bid to 4 7s might be risky without more evidence. However, I can increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same to 3 8s, which is a valid higher bid and potentially safer, as 8s might be less frequent. I do not have any 8s in my hand, but increasing the digit is the minimal raise and keeps the pressure on Player 5.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I am Player 5, and my hand is 72803749. There are 2 players (Player 3 and myself), each with 8 digits, for a total of 16 digits. The current bid is 3 8s, made by Player 3. I have one 8 in my hand. For Player 3's bid to be true, there must be at least three 8s in total, meaning Player 3 must have at least two 8s in their 8-digit hand. The statistical probability of a single player having two or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively low (approximately 19%). Given these odds, it is more likely that Player 3 does not have the required two 8s. Bidding higher would require me to bid 3 9s (I have one 9, requiring Player 3 to have two 9s) or 4 0s (I have one 0, requiring Player 3 to have three 0s), both of which seem riskier than challenging the current bid. Therefore, challenging the bid of 3 8s is the most statistically sound move.
