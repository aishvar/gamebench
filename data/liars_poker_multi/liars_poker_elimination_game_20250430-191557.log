Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make a valid initial bid. My hand contains two 3s and two 5s. Bidding 3 3s is a reasonable starting point, as it accounts for my two 3s plus a plausible estimate of one additional 3 from other players. This bid is conservative yet allows for escalation in subsequent turns.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None'. I have three 4s in my hand. Since I have a reasonable count of 4s, I can start with a bid of 5 4s, which is a modest increase in quantity from my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 4s and my hand containing 89008967, I notice I have no 4s but do have repeated digits. Considering the total digits remaining is 40 and there are 5 players, each with 8 digits, the bid of 5 4s seems plausible but not extremely high. Since I need to make a strictly higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit seems more feasible as I don't have enough information to safely increase the quantity beyond what might be reasonably expected. Given my hand and the need to make a higher bid, bidding on a higher digit that I have in my hand could be strategic. However, without specific knowledge of other players' hands, any bid involves risk. Since my hand contains two 8s and an 9, and considering the current bid is on 4s, I could consider bidding on a higher digit that I have, such as the 8s or 9s, but I must also consider the likelihood of these digits appearing in other players' hands. Given that I have two 8s and the current bid is 5 4s, bidding on 6s might not be the best strategy since I don't have any 6s, and bidding on 8s or 9s directly might be too risky without knowing more about the other players' hands. Therefore, considering a balance between risk and potential gain, and acknowledging that I must make a higher bid, I will choose to bid on a digit that is higher than 4 and for which I have some basis in my hand, but also considering the total number of digits and the potential distribution among players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I hold zero 8s. For the bid to be true, there must be at least 5 8s among the other 4 players (32 digits). The expected number of 8s in those 32 digits is 3.2 (32 * 0.1). While 5 is higher than the expectation, challenging isn't guaranteed. My hand contains three 2s. Bidding 6 2s requires 3 more 2s from the remaining 32 digits. The expected number of 2s in those digits is also 3.2. This makes 6 2s a statistically plausible bid strongly supported by my hand. It's a safer option than challenging and leverages my hand's strength.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand, so the bid of 6 2s requires at least four more 2s among the 32 unknown digits. The expected number of 2s there is about 3.2, and the probability of seeing four or more is only around 40%, making the current bid unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I am Player 4 and I start the bidding in this round with 4 active players and 32 total digits. My hand is 42407322, which contains three 2s, two 4s, one 0, one 3, and one 7. The highest frequency digit in my hand is 2 (three times). The expected number of any digit across all 32 digits is 3.2 (32/10). Since I hold three 2s, which is close to the average, it's statistically likely there are more 2s among the other 24 digits held by the other 3 players. Bidding 4 2s would be very safe (requiring only one more 2). Bidding 5 2s requires two more 2s from the remaining 24 digits, which is reasonably probable (estimated >70% chance). Given I start the bidding, 5 2s is a solid opening bid based on my strongest digit, setting a moderate challenge for the next player.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. My hand contains no 2s, and with 24 remaining digits across three opponents, the expected number of 2s is ~2.4. A total of 5 2s is statistically unlikely. Challenging forces verification, and if the bid is incorrect, Player 4 is eliminated.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I am Player 4 and I need to make the opening bid for this round with 3 players and 24 total digits. My hand is 42407322. I have three 2s, two 4s, one 0, one 3, and one 7. The expected average count for any digit is 2.4 (24 digits / 10 possibilities). My strongest digit is 2, with three in my hand, which is above the average. As the starting bidder, I should make a bid based on my strongest holding. Bidding '3 2s' is very safe but doesn't apply much pressure. Bidding '4 2s' requires only one more 2 among the 16 digits held by the other two players. Statistically, this is quite likely (estimated >80% probability). Bidding '5 2s' would require two more 2s and becomes significantly riskier. Therefore, bidding '4 2s' is a good opening move, leveraging my strong hand in 2s while having a high probability of being true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have two 2s in my hand. With 24 digits remaining, it's reasonable to assume there are at least 3 2s out there. However, I should be cautious about overbidding. I also have three 4s, which is a strong position. Bidding 5 2s is a safe and strategic move, increasing the quantity while playing it safe with a digit I know is present. Challenging seems risky given the current bid is relatively low and could be true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 2s by Player 1 and considering my hand contains no 2s but has a couple of high digits, I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Since my hand doesn't offer a straightforward path to increase the quantity of a specific digit significantly without risking a challenge, I must assess the likelihood of the current bid being true. With 24 digits remaining and 3 players, including myself, having 8 digits each, the distribution of digits is crucial. The bid of 5 2s seems plausible but not extremely high given the total number of digits. However, considering the history and the fact that challenges have led to eliminations, making a strategic decision is key. Given that I have two 8s and a 9, which are high digits, and considering the game's progression, I should aim to increase the bid in a way that utilizes my hand's strength without overestimating the presence of high digits across all players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s made by Player 3. I have zero 8s in my hand (42407322). This means the other two players (Player 1 and Player 3) need to have at least five 8s combined across their 16 digits for the bid to be true. While possible, this is statistically less likely than the expected average of 2.4 eights across all 24 digits. However, I have a strong hand for 2s (three 2s). Player 1 previously bid 5 2s in this round, indicating they likely hold at least two 2s. My three 2s plus Player 1's likely two or more 2s makes a total of at least five 2s highly probable. Bidding 6 2s is a statistically sound move based on my hand and the previous bidding history for 2s. It's a safer option than challenging 5 8s (which could be true) or bluffing with a higher digit I don't possess.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 2s, two 4s, and one 5 in my hand. Player 4 previously bid 6 2s. Since I have two 2s, I know there are at least 8 2s in play (since I have two and Player 4 has at least 6). I can bid 7 2s, which is a reasonable increase in quantity. I could also challenge but it is possible that Player 4 has 6 2s. I should bid instead.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 7 2s and the fact that I have one 2 in my hand (89008967), I must assess the likelihood of there being at least 7 twos among all active players. Since each player has 8 digits and there are 3 active players, the total number of digits is 24. My hand contains one 2, so I need at least 6 more 2s from the other two players to meet the current bid. Considering the bidding history, players have been relatively aggressive with their bids, and challenges have been made when bids seemed unlikely. However, without knowing the exact distribution of digits in other players' hands, it's challenging to determine the validity of the current bid with certainty. Given that I don't have enough information to confidently challenge or make a significantly higher bid, and considering the rules that require a bid to be strictly higher than the current one, I must decide based on the probability and the information I have. Since making a higher bid (either in quantity or digit) seems risky without more insight into other players' hands, and challenging could be risky if the bid turns out to be true, I need to weigh these risks. Given the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24, and we are already at a high quantity for the digit 2, increasing the quantity further might be risky. However, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same or slightly increasing it could be a viable strategy if I had a stronger hand in a different digit. Since my hand does not strongly support a higher bid in another digit that would be significantly convincing, and the current bid of 7 2s is already quite high, challenging seems like a reasonable option, especially considering the potential for the bid to be overstated given the total number of digits available.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 89008967, I have two 8s and two 9s, but also two 0s and other digits. Since the goal is to make a bid that is reasonable and has a good chance of being correct, I should consider the digits I have in abundance. However, with only 16 total digits remaining and my hand being half of that, I must be strategic. Bidding on a digit I have in my hand could be a good strategy, but I also need to consider what my opponent might have. Given that I have two 8s and they are high-value digits, bidding on 8s could be a good starting point. Considering the distribution of digits and the fact that I have a significant portion of the total digits, bidding 2 8s seems like a conservative yet plausible starting bid, especially since I have two 8s in my hand and there are only 16 digits in total.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s made by Player 3. I have zero 8s in my hand (42407322). For the bid to be true, Player 3 must have at least two 8s in their 8-digit hand. This is plausible, but challenging carries risk. I have three 2s in my hand. Bidding 3 2s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity). Since I hold three 2s, this bid is guaranteed to be true regardless of Player 3's hand. This is a safe bid that puts the pressure back on Player 3.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 3 2s and I have no 2s in my hand, but I do have digits that could potentially be bid upon, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least 3 twos. Since I don't have any twos, I'm relying on the possibility that Player 4 might have them. However, considering the game history and the fact that we're down to the last two players with only 16 digits remaining, making a significantly higher bid might not be feasible without more information. Given my hand 89008967, I notice I have multiple 8s and 9s, but bidding on those directly might not be the best strategy without knowing more about Player 4's hand. Challenging the bid seems like a viable option, especially since the bid of 3 2s is relatively low and I have no 2s to contribute to this count. If I challenge and win, I eliminate Player 4 and win the game. If I lose, I'm out. Given the potential reward and the fact that I have no 2s, challenging seems like the most strategic move, especially in a late game scenario where risk can be beneficial.
