Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7, one 9, one 3, one 2, one 0, and three 6s in my hand, with 3 sixes being the most frequent digit I hold. Since there is no current bid, I want to start with a reasonable bid that reflects my hand and is not too aggressive. Bidding 3 6s is a good starting point since I hold three 6s, making it plausible that there are at least three 6s among all players.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which is very likely given expected counts. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and guaranteed since I hold all three 7s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 2. I have 8 digits in my hand: 0, 6, 4, 2, 8, 6, 0, 8. I see that I have three 8s and two 6s. Given that the bid is 3 8s, I can see that it's possible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more beneficial. Since my hand contains three 8s, the total count of 8s could be higher than 3, but I don't have enough information about others' hands. However, I can make a bid that is higher. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it's higher in quantity than the current bid and I have two 6s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 92651309, which contains one 6. The current bid is 4 6s by Player 3. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an average of about 4.8 of each digit is expected across all hands. Since I only have one 6, it’s possible but not highly likely that there are at least 3 more 6s among the other 40 digits. However, bidding higher is safer than challenging at this low quantity. I’ll bid 4 7s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, as I have no 7s in my hand, but it’s a reasonable escalation.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid because it maintains the same quantity (4) but increases the digit (7 to 9), leveraging my existing 9s and challenging the current bid's digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. To make a valid higher bid, I must bid either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. My hand contains one 9, which slightly supports the plausibility of this bid. Since the current bid is already at quantity 4, I can increase the digit to 0 with the same quantity, which is the lowest digit higher than 9 in the next quantity. Therefore, bidding 5 0s is the next valid and reasonable step.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. To meet a bid of 5 7s I need just two more sevens among the 40 unseen cards, which is very likely (~92%). Since 5 7s is a valid raise over 5 0s, I will bid 5 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s made by Player 2. I have 8s in my hand (two 8s). Given that there are 6 players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 48 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. The bid of 5 8s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. I have two 8s and two 6s. The previous bid was 5 8s, so I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 6 or more 8s seems risky without knowing others' hands. However, I can increase the digit and quantity moderately.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s by Player 3. In my hand, I have two 9s, which contributes to the total count. With 48 total digits across all players, it's possible that there are at least 3 more 9s among the other 40 digits, as each player has 8 digits. However, the probability of exactly 5 or more 9s seems low given that 9s are just one of ten possible digits. On average, I would expect about 4.8 digits of any number across all players (48/10), so 5 is slightly above average. Since I have 2, it makes it a bit more plausible, but I still lean towards it being unlikely. I could bid higher, such as 6 0s or 6 9s, but I think challenging might be the better strategic move here to test the bid's validity, as I suspect it might be a bluff.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current round has just started with 5 active players. I, Player 3, am starting the bidding. I have the hand 06428608. I see that I have 2 sixes, which could be a good starting point. Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I notice that my hand contains 2 sixes. Considering there are 5 players and each has 8 digits, I can make an educated guess. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as a starting point.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s, which means at least four zeros exist among all players. I have one zero in my hand. Given the total of 40 digits, 4 zeros is a reasonable bid but I can increase the bid. I have two 6s and one 7, so bidding 4 6s is a valid higher bid and plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 1. I have the hand 06428608, which contains one 7 and other digits. Given that there are 4 active players and each has 8 digits, there are 32 digits in total. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. I should consider if bidding higher is reasonable or if challenging is more strategic. Since I have one 7, and assuming others might have a few as well, bidding 5 7s seems possible but risky without knowing others' hands. However, bidding 4 8s seems reasonable as it requires a higher digit than 7, and I have an 8 in my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. With 32 total digits remaining, the expected number of 8s is 3.2 (32 * 1/10), which is below the bid. My hand has no 8s, and others may not have enough either. Challenging is reasonable given the statistical improbability of 4 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Given there are 24 digits total among 3 players, having at least 2 nines is plausible. I can raise the bid by increasing the quantity or digit. Since 3 0s is the next higher bid after 2 9s, and I have two 6s in my hand, bidding 3 0s is reasonable as it increases the quantity and the digit is the lowest possible, making it a safe and valid bid.

Starting with 3 6s is reasonable because I have two 6s, and expecting at least one more 6 from the opponent is plausible given the total of 16 digits. This is a conservative but solid opening bid.
