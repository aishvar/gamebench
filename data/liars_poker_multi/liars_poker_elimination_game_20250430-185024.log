Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand and there is no current bid yet. A conservative opening bid of 2 6s leverages my hand while staying safe against an early challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s made by Player 0. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my goal is to make a strictly higher bid, I can either bid a higher quantity with 6s or switch to a higher digit. Bidding 3 6s would be a straightforward increase in quantity, but I should also consider if bidding a higher digit with the same or higher quantity makes sense. Given that I have an 8 and a 9 in my hand, bidding 2 8s or 2 9s could also be a strategy. However, increasing the quantity seems more conservative and likely given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which means there would need to be at least two more 6s among the other five players (total of 40 digits). Given that the probability of having two more 6s in 40 digits is moderate, I can either bid higher or challenge. Since the current bid is not extremely high, I'll make a conservative higher bid of 3 7s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 7. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total), Player 2's bid of 3 7s seems reasonable. Given my single 7, it's likely other players have the remaining two 7s. I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. Looking at my hand (12051765), I also have a 5, so bidding 3 8s would be a safe increase, moving to a higher digit while keeping the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 29810557, which contains one 8. The current bid is 3 8s by Player 3. With 48 total digits across 6 players, it's possible that there are at least 3 eights in play, especially since I have one myself. I don't think challenging is wise as the bid seems plausible. Instead, I will make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 3 8s, I can either increase the quantity to 4 or keep the quantity at 3 and bid a higher digit. Bidding 3 9s is a safer incremental increase, as it only requires raising the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have one 9 in my hand, which gives me some confidence in this bid, though I recognize it's still a risk given I only know my own digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand is 21690886, which contains two 6s and two 8s. To make a valid bid, I must bid strictly higher than 3 9s, which means increasing the quantity to at least 4 or keeping the quantity at 3 and increasing the digit (impossible as 9 is the highest). Bidding 4 of a digit I hold multiple of (like 6 or 8) is a reasonable strategy as it grounds the bid in my hand and requires fewer of that digit from the other players. Bidding 4 6s is a valid and plausible next bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 6s. The current bid is 4 sixes. To outbid this I can raise the quantity to 5 sixes, leveraging my pair. The probability of at least three more 6s among the other 40 cards is roughly 78%, making 5 sixes a plausible increase. Bidding a higher digit like 4 sevens is riskier since I hold no 7s.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 0. I have 2 sixes in my hand (19408169). To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s, bidding a higher quantity seems risky without knowing others' hands. However, I can see that bidding 5 7s would be a higher bid because it increases the digit. Given that there are 48 total digits and 6 players with 8 digits each, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. A bid of 5 7s seems plausible and higher than the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 5 7s, which seems high given that there are 6 players with 8 digits each (48 total digits). The probability of there being at least 5 7s across all hands is relatively low, especially since the bidding has escalated quickly from 4 6s to 5 7s. Challenging seems like the best move to eliminate Player 1 if the count is indeed less than 5.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The last round saw aggressive bidding on higher digits, but with Player 1 eliminated, the total digits are now 40. Starting with a conservative bid based on my hand seems prudent. Bidding 2 9s is a safe initial move, as it's higher than the previous starting bid of 2 6s and aligns with my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (12051765), I have zero 9s. The current bid of '2 9s' is relatively low considering there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total digits). Even though I don't have any 9s, it's quite possible that 2 or more 9s exist among the other 32 digits I can't see. I should make a conservative higher bid. Since I have one 0, bidding '3 0s' is reasonable - it increases the quantity while switching to a lower digit, which is a valid move. This gives others room to bid while not being too risky.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:3 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 29810557, which contains one 0. The current bid is 3 0s by Player 3, meaning they are claiming there are at least three 0s across all 40 digits. Since I have one 0, it's possible that the other players collectively have at least two more 0s, making the bid plausible. However, I need to make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity to 4 or more of a digit, or keep the quantity at 3 and bid a higher digit than 0, which would be 1 or above. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s and two 7s, which are my strongest digits. Bidding 4 5s seems reasonable as I contribute two 5s myself, and it's possible the other players have at least two more 5s among their 32 digits. This bid increases the quantity from 3 to 4, satisfying the 'higher bid' rule. I don't think challenging is wise here since 3 0s is not an outrageous bid with 40 total digits in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s, which is the average expected count for a digit among 40 total digits. While I have zero 5s in my hand, making a challenge a possibility, bidding is generally safer early in the round, especially when the bid is near the average. My hand contains two 8s. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is well-supported by my hand, as needing two more 8s from the remaining 32 digits (where the average is 3.2) is a reasonable expectation. This bid allows the game to continue.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, so the bid of 4 8s relies entirely on the other 32 cards. With an expected 3.2 8s among them, the chance of seeing at least 4 is only about 40%, making the bid unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. With 32 total digits and four players, I expect about 3.2 zeros overall; given my two zeros and 24 unknown digits, the expected additional zeros are ~2.4, for a total of ~4.4. A bid of 4 0s thus has over a 60% chance of being correct, making it a strong, safe opening.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand (94136721). The current bid is 4 0s, which means there would need to be at least three more 0s among the other three players' hands (24 digits total). Given that 0s are less common and the previous bids have been aggressive, challenging seems reasonable as it's unlikely there are three more 0s.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s gives about an 80% chance of being correct (I need just one more among the other 16 cards) and is a strong opener that pressures opponents to raise quantity or digit significantly.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand (12051765), I have only one 6. The current bid claims there are at least 3 sixes among all players. With 24 total digits and 3 players, each having 8 digits, and seeing only one 6 in my hand, it's possible but somewhat unlikely that there are two more 6s between the other two players. Player 0 has shown aggressive bidding behavior in previous rounds. Given this, and that I only see one 6, challenging seems like the better option than raising to 4 6s or changing the digit.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 3 6s requires only one more from my opponent. The expected total number of 6s across both hands is about 2.8, making a bid of 3 sixes plausible (roughly a 57% chance of being correct). This is a strong yet reasonable opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 29810557, which contains no 6s. The current bid by Player 0 is 3 6s, meaning there should be at least three 6s across the total 16 digits between us. Since I have none, all three 6s would need to be in Player 0's hand of 8 digits for the bid to be valid. This is possible but not highly likely (only about a 12.5% chance if digits are random). However, given that we're down to two players and I need to bid higher, I’ll take a conservative approach and bid 4 0s, as I have one 0 in my hand, increasing the quantity and changing the digit to a higher one. This seems safer than challenging a bid that could plausibly be true.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, so Player 4 would need at least two more 0s among their 8 cards to make four total. The chance of that is quite low (under 20%), so the bid of 4 0s is unlikely. I should challenge.
