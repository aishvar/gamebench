Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '1' in my hand. The current bid is 2 1s, which means there needs to be at least one more '1' among the other five players' hands (40 digits). This is plausible, so I will make a higher bid. I have two '2s' in my hand, so bidding 3 2s increases both the quantity and the digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 2s' and my hand '87475279', I notice I have one '2' and no other information about the other players' hands. To make a valid higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I only have one '2', bidding higher on '2s' is not feasible based on my hand alone. However, I can consider bidding on a higher digit. My hand contains '7s', '8s', '9s', which are higher than '2'. Considering the total number of digits is 48 and we are early in the game, bidding on one of these higher digits could be strategic. Given I have two '7s', this seems like a reasonable starting point for a higher bid, as it increases both the digit value from '2' to '7' and maintains a relatively low quantity that might be achievable given the total number of digits in play.

Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 2s' and my hand of 87475279, I notice I have one 2 and one 7. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I could increase the quantity or the digit. Considering the total digits remaining and the fact that I have a 7, which is higher than 2, I can make a reasonable bid by keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains two 7s, and the current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 4 7s increases the quantity while maintaining the digit. With 40 remaining digits across other players, it is plausible there are at least two more 7s to meet the new bid. Challenging carries risk since the bid is likely valid (expected ~4 sevens total). A cautious escalation in quantity is safer than challenging or bidding higher digits with limited evidence.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 8 and one 6 in my hand.  A bid of 4 7s is plausible with 6 players and 48 digits, but it's on the higher side. My hand doesn't strongly support bidding on 7s or anything significantly higher in quantity. Bidding 4 8s is a slight increase and I have an 8, making it a reasonable next bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (03168619). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since there are 48 total digits and 6 players, the maximum number of any digit is 48. The current bid of 4 8s is relatively conservative. I can increase the quantity to 5 8s or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Given that I have one 8, it's plausible that there are at least 4 8s in total. Bidding 5 8s seems reasonable as it slightly increases the quantity.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have a 9 in my hand, so bidding 5 9s is a valid higher bid. This increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is allowed. It leverages my hand's 9 without risking a challenge if the actual count of 8s is uncertain.

Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 2 2s and I have the hand 87475279, I notice I don't have any 2s. However, I do have multiple occurrences of other digits. Considering the total digits remaining is 40 and there are 5 players, each with 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 40. Since the current bid is low, increasing the quantity or the digit seems reasonable. I will consider bidding on a digit I have, aiming for a higher quantity or a higher digit than 2s. Given my hand, a reasonable increase would be to bid on a digit I possess, like 7, which appears twice in my hand. Thus, bidding 2 7s seems like a cautious yet strategic move, as it increases the digit from 2 to 7 without overly increasing the quantity, which might be perceived as too risky given the information available.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s. Bidding 2 8s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Since I possess one 8, it's reasonable to assume another player has at least one 8, making the total count of 8s likely to meet or exceed the bid. Challenging the current bid would be risky, as my two 7s ensure the 2 7s bid is valid.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand has one 8. The current bid is 2 8s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 4 (40 / 10). Since the bid is only 2 8s and I have one, it's quite plausible that there are at least two 8s among the 5 players. I can comfortably bid higher. I have two 2s and two 4s. Bidding 3 2s or 3 4s are valid options, increasing the quantity. Bidding 3 2s seems slightly safer given the previous bids in this round.

To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll make a conservative bid by increasing the digit. Bidding 3 3s is a valid higher bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s. With 5 players and 40 digits total, it's possible there are 3 or more 3s across all hands. However, the bid is already at the lower end of plausibility. I can either bid higher or challenge. Since I have a 4 in my hand, I can bid 3 4s, which is a higher digit than 3s and maintains the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 3 4s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Looking at my hand, 87475279, I notice I have one 7 and no 4s or higher digits that could directly influence a bid. However, since the game is about the total count across all players, I must consider the likelihood of other players having certain digits. The previous bids indicate a spread across different digits, but no one has bid on the quantity of 5 or more for any digit yet. Considering the total digits remaining (40) and the fact that each player has 8 digits, it's plausible that some digits could appear more frequently than others. Given my hand doesn't give me a clear advantage for bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity (since I'd need to bid at least 3 5s to increase the digit, which I'm not confident in), I should look at increasing the quantity. However, given the total number of digits and the distribution so far, bidding too high might not be wise without more information. Since I don't have enough information to confidently bid higher and considering the risk of challenging, I should think about the safest move that could potentially put pressure on other players or force a reveal. Given these considerations and the fact that I don't have a strong basis for a higher bid, challenging the current bid might be a viable option, especially if I think the actual count of 4s could be lower than 3, given the random distribution of digits. But, since challenging directly depends on the likelihood of the bid being incorrect and I don't have enough information to assess this accurately, I should focus on making a reasonable bid based on the information I have. The safest increase would be to bid on a digit that I have some knowledge of or can reasonably assume might exist in sufficient quantities across all players' hands. Since I have a 7 and there was a previous bid of 2 7s, it might indicate some presence of 7s, but bidding 3 7s would not be an increase from the current bid of 3 4s in terms of digit value. Thus, I need to think about either increasing the quantity for a digit I think might be common or challenging if I believe the current bid overestimates the actual count. Given the constraints and aiming for a cautious approach that doesn't overextend, I should consider the potential distribution and my limited knowledge. A reasonable approach might be to slightly increase the quantity for a digit that has been bid on before or seems plausible, but given the current bid of 3 4s and my lack of 4s or higher digits, I must weigh the risk of overbidding against the potential gain of challenging. Without clear evidence or a strong hunch that the current bid is incorrect, and considering the need to make a strictly higher bid, I should look for a balance that doesn't put me at undue risk. Considering all previous bids and the fact that no one has challenged the last few bids, it seems players are cautious, possibly indicating they believe their bids are reasonable or they're waiting for more information. Given this context, making a bid that is cautiously higher seems prudent, but I must ensure it's not so high as to be unbelievable. Since I don't have enough 4s or higher to confidently bid on those, and given the distribution of bids so far, I should think about what could realistically be the next step without overstepping. The key is finding a balance between bidding high enough to be taken seriously and not so high as to be challenged. Given these considerations, I decide to focus on a digit that could plausibly meet the higher quantity, considering the total number of digits and the bids made so far.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s and no other repeated digits. Since the game has just started with 4 players and 32 total digits, it's reasonable to start with a moderate bid. Considering my hand and the fact that I don't have any information about the other players' hands, bidding on a digit I have, like the 7, seems prudent. However, since I only have two 7s, bidding on a higher quantity of 7s might be risky without knowing the distribution in other players' hands. Instead, I could consider bidding on a digit that appears in my hand but also has a potential to appear in others, given the distribution of digits in a typical set of numbers. Since I have a 7 and a few other digits, and considering the need to start with a bid that is not too high but still engaging, I will choose a digit and quantity that seem reasonable given the total number of digits and the fact that we are starting fresh. Given that I have a 7 and considering the distribution, I might bid on a lower digit or the same digit but ensure the quantity is reasonable. However, since I need to make the first bid and it needs to be higher than 'None', I should consider what would be a safe yet engaging starting point. Given the total digits and aiming to start the bidding without risking too much, I will consider my hand's composition and the potential distribution across other players. Since my hand contains a 7 and other digits, and given that we are starting the round, a moderate approach would be to bid on a digit that has a good chance of appearing across all hands, considering the total count of digits is 32. Aiming for a balance, I notice I have two 7s, which could suggest that bidding on 7s could be a good start, but I must ensure the quantity is not too high given the uncertainty of other players' hands. Therefore, considering all these factors, my initial bid should reflect a balance between being competitive and being cautious, given the information available.

Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 4s and considering my hand has a 7 and other non-4 digits, I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Since my hand doesn't contain any 4s, and considering the distribution of digits, bidding higher on a digit I don't have might be risky. However, challenging without having a clear idea of the distribution of 4s among other players could also be risky. Given that we are in a late stage of the game with only 4 players left and 32 digits remaining, the likelihood of there being at least 3 4s is plausible but not guaranteed. My hand does contain digits that could potentially be bidding targets (like 7), but I don't have enough information to safely bid higher on those digits without risking a challenge. Considering the game history, players have been somewhat conservative with their bids, and the challenge to 5 9s earlier in the game showed that overbidding can be punished. Given these considerations, making a bid that is slightly higher but still reasonable seems like a safer strategy than challenging directly, especially since I don't have a strong basis to assume the current bid of 3 4s is definitely incorrect.

My hand contains 87475279, which has no 6s but does contain other digits. Since the current bid is 3 6s, to make a higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. However, with only 24 total digits remaining and considering the elimination process, bidding on a higher quantity of the same digit or a higher digit seems risky without more information. Since I don't have any 6s and considering the risk, challenging the current bid might be a safer option, but given that I have to make a strictly higher bid, I should look for a reasonable increase. Given that the highest digit I have in abundance is 7, and considering the need to increase the bid, I could consider bidding on a higher digit than 6, such as 7, with the same quantity, which would be a reasonable and strategic move.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains two 2s, two 4s, one 6, one 8, one 0, and one 3. The current bid is 3 7s. With 24 total digits, the expected count of any single digit is around 2.4 (24 / 10). Bidding 3 7s is slightly above average, but not unreasonable. I have no 7s. I have two 2s and two 4s. I can make a higher bid based on my hand. Bidding 4 2s or 4 4s would be a significant jump in quantity. Bidding 3 8s or 3 9s would be a smaller jump in digit. Given my two 2s and two 4s, bidding 4 2s or 4 4s seems like a strong move based on my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s made by Player 4. I have 8 digits: 03168619, which contains one '2'. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 24 digits in total and the current bid is 4 2s, it's plausible that there are at least 4 twos. I see that I have one '2', so the remaining players must have at least 3 more '2's. Bidding 4 3s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit. However, I should first consider if there's a more likely bid. I have two '6's, which is a relatively high count for a single digit in my hand. The previous bid was 3 7s, so bidding 4 6s or higher could be a good option. Let's analyze: Bidding 4 3s is a valid move as it increases the digit. I can see that I have one '3', so there are likely 3 or more '3's in total. Thus, bidding 4 3s is a reasonable and safe choice.

Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 3s and my hand containing 87475279, I notice I have one 7 and no 3s or higher digits that would directly influence the current bid. However, considering the bidding history and the fact that we are down to 24 total digits, making a significantly higher bid might be risky. Since the current bid is 4 3s, to make a higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Given that I have a 7 in my hand and there's been a previous bid of 3 7s by me, it seems plausible that there could be enough 7s to make a bid of 4 7s reasonable, especially since my bid would be increasing both in digit value from the current bid of 3s to 7s, and matching the quantity of 4.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have the hand 03168619, which contains one 2. With 24 total digits remaining and 2 players left who haven't revealed their hands, it's possible that the other players have more 2s. However, bidding 6 2s seems too aggressive. I can bid 5 3s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid. This is a reasonable move given my hand and the current state.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 3s by Player 5 and considering my hand 87475279, which contains one 3 and other digits, I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 5 threes among all players. With a total of 24 digits remaining and each player having 8 digits, the distribution of threes seems plausible but not excessively high. However, without exact knowledge of other players' hands, I must consider the strategic aspect. Since the bid is already at 5 for a digit, increasing the quantity further might be risky without strong evidence. Given my hand does not strongly support a higher bid for threes, and considering the risk of overbidding, I should look for an alternative. Bidding on a different digit that I have more information on or challenging the current bid are my options. Given that my hand has two 7s and a bid of 4 7s was previously made by me and not challenged, it suggests that bidding higher on 7s could be viable. However, the current bid is on 3s, and I must decide whether to challenge or find a higher bid. Since I don't have sufficient 3s to confidently raise the bid on 3s, and considering the total number of digits remaining, challenging seems like a less favorable option without strong evidence against the bid. Thus, I need to consider if there's a digit I can bid higher on. Given the constraints and aiming to make a strategic move, I can bid on a digit I have more of, but since the current bid is high and specific to 3s, I must carefully consider my next step. Bidding on 7s again seems like a potential strategy, but I must ensure it's higher than the current bid. The last bid on 7s from me was 4 7s, and to be strictly higher than 5 3s, I could consider bidding on 7s with a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. However, since I have two 7s and the game is nearing its end with only 24 digits remaining, the likelihood of there being many more 7s is low. Therefore, my best option, considering the need to be strictly higher than 5 3s and the composition of my hand, is to carefully evaluate the potential for other digits. Given these considerations and the fact that I need to make a move that is strictly higher, I must think about the digits I have and their potential distribution. Since challenging directly requires a belief that the current bid is unlikely, and without concrete evidence, this might not be the safest move. Instead, focusing on making a strategic bid that takes into account the information I have and the bids made so far is crucial.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s from Player 2. I have two 2s in my hand. With two other players, the expected number of 2s is around 24/10 = 2.4.  A bid of 6 2s is quite high, almost double the expected value. However, Player 2 might have several 2s. Looking at my hand, I have two 4s. Bidding 6 4s would be an increase in digit but not quantity, which is not a valid higher bid. I need to increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. A bid of 6 3s is not valid as 3 is lower than 2. A bid of 7 0s or higher quantity seems risky without more information or a stronger hand in a specific digit. Given the high bid on 2s and the fact that I have two 2s, challenging 6 2s seems like a reasonable move as it is significantly above the expected value.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s made by Player 4. I have the hand 03168619, which contains one '2' and no other '2's. So, the total count of '2's must be at least 1 (mine) + 1 (assumed minimum from Player 4's hand, as they bid 4 2s). The total count of '2's is likely to be around 2, given that both players have 8 digits. Bidding 4 3s is a valid higher bid because it increases the digit. However, I should consider challenging or making a slightly higher bid if I think the current bid is too high. Since I have one '2', it's plausible that the total count is at least 2. Given that there are 16 digits in total and Player 4 bid 4 2s, it's a bit aggressive but possible. I will make a higher bid by increasing the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s made by Player 4. I have the hand 03168619, which contains one '2' (at index 4) and no other '2's. So, I know I have exactly 1 '2'. The total count of '2's across both our hands must be at least 1 (mine) plus some number from Player 4's hand. If Player 4 has no '2's, the total count is 1. If Player 4 has all '2's (which is 8, since they have 8 digits), the total count is 9. Thus, the total count of '2's is between 1 and 9. The bid of 5 2s is within this possible range but is quite high given that it's above the average distribution. However, it's not impossible. I need to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since the maximum quantity is 16 and we have 16 digits in total, the quantity cannot exceed 8 '2's for it to be potentially valid (because we can't have more than 8 '2's in 16 digits if one player has 8 digits). A bid of 5 2s is already quite aggressive. I can bid 5 3s, which is a higher bid. My hand has two '3's, so it's plausible that the total count could be around or more than 5 '3's. Thus, bidding 5 3s seems like a reasonable action.

Since there are 16 digits in total and we have seen 2 fours so far (one in my hand and at least one in Player 4's hand as they bid on it), bidding 5 5s or 6 4s could be reasonable. However, increasing the digit to 5s seems more conservative and likely to be true given the distribution of digits. I will bid 5 5s.
