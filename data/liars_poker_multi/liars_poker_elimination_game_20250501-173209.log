Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first bidder and the current bid is 'None'. I need to make a starting bid. My hand contains two 7s, two 9s, one 1, one 6, and one 2. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8. A bid of 3 7s seems reasonable, as I have two 7s and it's below the average, making it likely that at least one other player has a 7.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 7, increasing the quantity is risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding a higher digit with a low quantity is an option. I have a 8 in my hand, so bidding 1 8s is not useful, but I can try to bid a higher digit with a reasonable quantity. Given that I have an 8 and a 9, and no information suggests there are many 8s or 9s, I could bid 3 8s to match the quantity and increase the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand of '18171034', I have zero 8s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. Player 1 claims there are at least 3 8s total. Since I don't have any 8s, and Player 1's bid is relatively conservative (only 3), it's quite possible other players have enough 8s to make this bid valid. I see I have three 1s in my hand, so I could safely bid '3 9s' to go higher, but that might be too aggressive. A safer play would be to bid '4 0s' since I have one 0 myself, making it more credible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (70552185), I have one 0 and one 7. The current bid is 4 0s. Since I only have one 0 in my hand, there would need to be at least 3 more 0s among the other 5 players' hands. That's certainly possible, as it would only require about 0.6 zeros per player on average. I could bid 5 0s, but that seems risky without more information. I could also switch to a different digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, which gives me more confidence. I can bid 4 5s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This seems like a safer play based on my knowledge of my own hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have two 5s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity above 4 or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. The next higher digit after 5 is 6, but I have no 6s. Increasing the quantity to 5 with a digit of 0 is a valid move and more aggressive. Since I have one 0 in my hand, bidding 5 0s is reasonable.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 6 0s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have some information to support that possibility. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have one 2, one 3, one 5, one 6 and one 8. Bidding 4 2s or 4 3s or 4 5s seems plausible, but 6 0s is the most conservative and likely to be successful given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 17796299. I have one 1, one 2, two 7s, two 9s, one 6, and zero 0s, 3s, 4s, 5s, or 8s. The current bid is 6 0s. Since I have no 0s, I need to consider the likelihood of other players having 6 or more 0s combined. With 5 other players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits among them. A bid of 6 0s is possible, but not extremely likely on average (average would be around 4-5 0s).  However, challenging a bid of 6 0s when I have zero 0s is risky, as I'd lose if there are indeed 6 or more 0s.  I need to make a higher bid. I have two 7s and two 9s. Bidding on 7s or 9s seems like a good strategy based on my hand. A bid of 7 7s is higher than 6 0s and is plausible given I have two 7s. A bid of 7 9s is also a valid option.  Given the previous bids have been increasing reasonably, bidding 7 7s is a safe and higher bid based on my hand strength in 7s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s made by Player 0. I have 8 digits in my hand: 4, 5, 8, 9, 3, 0, 8, 7. I see that I have two 7s and two 8s. Given that the bid is 7 7s, I need to make a higher bid. Since my hand contains two 8s, bidding on 8s seems reasonable. The current bid quantity is 7, so I need to bid at least 8 8s to have a higher quantity. However, I should also consider if there's a possibility that 7 7s could be true, given that I only have two 7s and there are 5 other players. Bidding 8 8s seems like a safe bet as it increases both quantity and digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (18171034), I have zero 8s. The current bid of 8 8s by Player 1 seems very high given that: 1) I have no 8s in my hand, 2) Players have been making relatively conservative bids until now, 3) For there to be 8 8s, other players would need to have a very high concentration of 8s, which is statistically unlikely. Even with 48 total digits remaining, having 8 8s when I see none in my hand is improbable. A challenge is the safest move.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 0, one 1, two 7s, and one 8 in my hand. Since I'm starting the round and know my own hand, making a conservative bid based on what I actually see is wise. With two 7s in my hand, bidding 3 7s is reasonable as it's likely there are at least one more 7 among the other 32 digits in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the likelihood of there being at least 3 7s among all players. Looking at my own hand (70552185), I have one 7. This means I need to assess if there are likely to be at least 2 more 7s among the other 4 players' 32 digits. With 10 possible digits (0-9), the expected distribution would be about 3.2 of each digit. Since I already have 1 seven, it's reasonable that there could be 2 or more among the other players. However, I can make a higher bid based on my hand. I have three 5s, which gives me confidence to bid on 5s. I could bid '4 5s' (higher quantity than current bid) or even '3 8s' (same quantity but higher digit) since I have one 8 in my hand. I'll go with '4 5s' since I have strong evidence for it in my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. My hand contains one 5. The previous bid was 3 7s, and the current bid increased quantity but changed digit to 5s. To bid higher, I must either increase the quantity or keep quantity 4 and increase digit above 5. I have one 7 in my hand, so bidding 4 7s is a reasonable next step, as it is a valid higher bid and aligns with my hand, making the bid plausible.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have zero 7s in my hand. Given the history of challenges and eliminations, and the relatively low total digit count (40), a bid of 4 7s seems plausible but risky. I could bid higher in quantity, but that increases the risk of being wrong. I could bid the same quantity with a higher digit, but I don't have a strong hand for any other digit. Since I have no 7s, and the previous player bid 4 7s, I'll challenge to try and eliminate Player 4.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have the digits 3, 3, 5, 0, 6, 4, 0, 9 in my hand. Notably, I have two 0s and one 5. Given the previous rounds' bids, bids around 4 to 8 of a digit were contested and challenged successfully or unsuccessfully. Starting the round, a conservative bid on a digit I hold twice, like 2 0s, would be too low and easily outbid. I will start with a bid that is reasonably challenging but plausible: 3 0s. This is higher than no bid and based on my hand, I can reasonably expect at least three 0s among all players' 32 digits.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 0s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s. While it's possible there are three 0s among the other three players, it's not a very high bid relative to the total digits (32). I have three 7s and three 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid and is supported by my hand. Bidding 3 9s is also valid. Bidding 4 of any digit is also valid. Given my hand, bidding 3 7s or 3 9s is a safe move. Bidding 3 7s is a lower digit than 3 9s, which might be slightly less aggressive. Bidding 3 7s seems like a reasonable next step.

Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand of 18171034, I have one 7. The current bid is 3 7s. Given the history, Player 0 has bid 7s multiple times, suggesting they might have multiple 7s. With 32 total digits and 4 players, 3 7s is quite plausible. I can see from my hand that there's at least one 7, and it's reasonable that two more exist among the other 24 digits. Rather than challenge, I should make a higher bid. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding 3 8s is a reasonable increase that doesn't overcommit.

Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze if I should bid higher or challenge the current bid of '3 8s'. Looking at my hand (70552185), I have one 8, which means there are at least that many in play. For there to be at least 3 8s total, the other three players would need to have at least 2 more 8s among them, which is quite reasonable with 24 other digits in play. Since I can see one 8 in my hand, the bid of '3 8s' seems plausible. I could bid '3 9s' (same quantity, higher digit) or increase the quantity to '4' with a lower digit. Since I have two 5s in my hand, bidding '4 5s' would be reasonable, but I've already made that bid earlier. I also have one 7, so I could bid '4 7s', but that was challenged before and shown to be exactly correct, making it risky. I'll bid '4 0s' since I have one 0 in my hand, and it's a safe increase in quantity while dropping to a lower digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have two 0s in my hand (positions 4 and 7). Since the bid is 4 0s, and I hold 2, it is plausible that there are at least 4 zeros in total among all players. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. Increasing the digit while keeping quantity at 4 means bidding 4 1s or higher digits. I have only one 1 (digit '1' is not in my hand), so bidding 4 1s would be risky. Instead, I can increase the quantity to 5 and bid 5 0s, which is a higher quantity and the same digit, and I hold two zeros myself, so it's a moderate risk. Given the previous bid is 4 0s, bidding 5 0s is a reasonable and valid higher bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have zero 0s in my hand. With 32 total digits, a bid of 5 0s represents a significant portion (roughly 1 in 6.4 digits). While not impossible, the probability of there being five or more 0s across the remaining hands seems low enough to warrant a challenge, especially since I have none to support the bid. The previous bids in this round have been relatively conservative, and jumping to 5 0s after 4 0s feels like a potential bluff.

Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (70552185), I have one 8. Player 2 has bid 3 8s, meaning they believe there are at least 3 8s total among all players. Since I have 1 eight, there would need to be at least 2 more 8s between Player 0 and Player 2 for this bid to be valid. This is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's risky. Alternatively, I could make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, which gives me confidence to bid on 5s. I could bid 3 9s (higher digit) or 4 0s (higher quantity). Since I have one 0 in my hand, bidding 4 0s seems reasonable - I'd need 3 more 0s between the other two players, which is possible. I'll go with 4 0s as my bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (18171034), I have zero 9s. The current bid claims there are 5 nines among 24 total digits. For this to be true, the other two players would need to have 5 nines between them (8 digits each). While possible, this seems unlikely given the high quantity. Additionally, players often bid high quantities of 9s as bluffs since it's harder to bid higher. Given I have zero 9s in my hand, and the relatively high bid of 5 out of 24 possible digits, challenging seems like the optimal move.

I could challenge, but it's a risky move this early. Alternatively, I can make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, so bidding on 5s would be supported by my own hand. I also have one 8, one 0, and one 1. I'll bid '3 5s' since I know I have two 5s myself, so Player 2 would only need to have one more 5 for this to be valid, which seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (18171034), I have zero 5s. Since there are only 16 total digits between both players, and Player 3 claims there are at least 3 5s total, this means they would need to have at least 3 5s in their hand. While possible, this seems unlikely. Given I have zero 5s and can verify this claim, challenging is the safer option rather than making a higher bid.
