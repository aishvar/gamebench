Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid. I have a strong hand with four 2s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, the average count for any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8. Bidding based on my strongest digit is a good strategy. I will bid 5 2s, which is slightly above the average and reflects my hand strength.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. I could bid higher, but it's early in the round and I don't have much information. I will bid slightly higher to gather more information. I'll bid 6 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. I have three 7s in my hand. With 5 other players holding 40 digits, the expected number of 7s among them is around 4. This brings the total expected count of 7s to approximately 7 (my 3 + others' 4). Bidding 7 7s is a plausible and strategic move, increasing the quantity from the previous bid of 6 3s and leveraging my strong hand. Challenging 6 3s is an option, but 6 3s is not an extremely high bid, and I prefer to use my strong hand to make a bid and stay in the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, so all 7s must be in the 40 unknown cards. The expected number of 7s in those is 4 with a standard deviation of about 1.9, making the chance of at least 7 only around 9%. Player 2â€™s bid of 7 7s is extremely unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand and there are 32 unknown digits remaining. The expected number of additional 6s is about 3.2, giving roughly an 84% chance of at least four 6s total. Opening with 4 6s is a safe, plausible bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 3. I have one 6 in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total number of digits is 40. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 6, bidding a higher quantity seems risky without knowing others' hands. However, I can try to bid a higher digit with a reasonable quantity. Bidding 4 7s seems like a good strategy as it increases the digit and I have a 7 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s, which seems plausible given that there are 40 total digits and 5 players. However, since I only have one 7, it's possible that the total count is close to the bid. To stay in the game, I'll make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 8, which is a safe move as I have one 8 in my hand.

  "reasoning": "My hand is 26503222, which contains three 2s, one 6, one 5, one 0, one 3, and zero 8s. The current bid is 4 8s. Since I have no 8s, I need to consider if it's likely that the other 4 players have at least four 8s among them (32 digits total). On average, we'd expect about 3.2 of any given digit (40 total digits / 10 digits = 4 per digit, but with 5 players and 8 digits each, it's 40 total digits, so 40/10 = 4 expected per digit, but

Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, the expected number of any digit is 5 * (8/10) = 4. While 4 8s is possible, given I have none, the probability of there being four 8s among the other four players is lower than if I had one or more. The previous bids in this round were 4 6s and 4 7s, suggesting players are bidding conservatively at the start of the round. Challenging at 4 8s seems reasonable given my hand and the current bid level.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is None, and I have two 9s in my hand. Starting with a conservative bid of 2 9s seems reasonable, as it's based on my own hand and leaves room for others to bid higher.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. I could bid 3 0s, which is the lowest possible bid that is higher. However, I have two 1s and four 4s. I will bid 3 1s. This is a safe bid and builds the count of 1s which I have in my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand and there are 24 unknown digits. The expected number of 6s among those is 24Ã—0.1=2.4, so the total is likely around 4.4, making at least 3 very probable. Bidding 3 6s over 3 1s is a valid raise (same quantity, higher digit) with high confidence.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 3. I have a 6 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 6, increasing the quantity to 4 or more would be risky without knowing the other players' hands. However, I can increase the digit. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and is a valid higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which seems plausible given that there are 32 digits in total and 4 players. However, I don't have strong evidence to challenge, and I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 3 9s is a reasonable next step.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. I could bid 4 of any digit, or 3 of a digit higher than 9, which is not possible. Therefore, I will bid 4 0s, as 0 is a valid digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, making â€˜5 6sâ€™ a plausible increase. The current bid of 4 0s is likely true (â‰ˆ71%), so challenging is risky. Instead, raising to 5 6s leverages my two 6s and an expected â‰ˆ2.4 unknown 6s (chance of at least three more â‰ˆ43%), making it a reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 3. I have a 6 in my hand, and I know there are 32 total digits remaining across all players. Given that there are 4 active players and each has 8 digits, I should assess the likelihood of there being 5 or more 6s. Since I only have one 6, and the maximum possible 6s from other players would be 3 (if they each had one), the total could be 4 at most from other players if I don't count my own. This makes 5 6s seem unlikely but not impossible. However, bidding 6 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. With three other players, it's possible that there are at least six 6s in total, but it's a risky bid. Given that the bid is already high and I don't have strong evidence to support a higher bid, challenging seems like the safer option.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (29449869). The current bid is 3 6s, which means there would need to be at least two more 6s among the other two players' hands (Player 1 and Player 3). Given that the previous bids have been aggressive and challenges have been successful, it's possible that the current bid is overestimating the actual count. I should challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. There are 16 total digits. I could bid 4 0s, but that might be too risky.
