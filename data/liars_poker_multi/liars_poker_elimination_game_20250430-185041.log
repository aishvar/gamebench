Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid. I have a strong hand with four 2s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, the average count for any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8. Bidding based on my strongest digit is a good strategy. I will bid 5 2s, which is slightly above the average and reflects my hand strength.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. I could bid higher, but it's early in the round and I don't have much information. I will bid slightly higher to gather more information. I'll bid 6 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. I have three 7s in my hand. With 5 other players holding 40 digits, the expected number of 7s among them is around 4. This brings the total expected count of 7s to approximately 7 (my 3 + others' 4). Bidding 7 7s is a plausible and strategic move, increasing the quantity from the previous bid of 6 3s and leveraging my strong hand. Challenging 6 3s is an option, but 6 3s is not an extremely high bid, and I prefer to use my strong hand to make a bid and stay in the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, so all 7s must be in the 40 unknown cards. The expected number of 7s in those is 4 with a standard deviation of about 1.9, making the chance of at least 7 only around 9%. Player 2’s bid of 7 7s is extremely unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand and there are 32 unknown digits remaining. The expected number of additional 6s is about 3.2, giving roughly an 84% chance of at least four 6s total. Opening with 4 6s is a safe, plausible bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 3. I have one 6 in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total number of digits is 40. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 6, bidding a higher quantity seems risky without knowing others' hands. However, I can try to bid a higher digit with a reasonable quantity. Bidding 4 7s seems like a good strategy as it increases the digit and I have a 7 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s, which seems plausible given that there are 40 total digits and 5 players. However, since I only have one 7, it's possible that the total count is close to the bid. To stay in the game, I'll make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 8, which is a safe move as I have one 8 in my hand.

  "reasoning": "My hand is 26503222, which contains three 2s, one 6, one 5, one 0, one 3, and zero 8s. The current bid is 4 8s. Since I have no 8s, I need to consider if it's likely that the other 4 players have at least four 8s among them (32 digits total). On average, we'd expect about 3.2 of any given digit (40 total digits / 10 digits = 4 per digit, but with 5 players and 8 digits each, it's 40 total digits, so 40/10 = 4 expected per digit, but

Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, the expected number of any digit is 5 * (8/10) = 4. While 4 8s is possible, given I have none, the probability of there being four 8s among the other four players is lower than if I had one or more. The previous bids in this round were 4 6s and 4 7s, suggesting players are bidding conservatively at the start of the round. Challenging at 4 8s seems reasonable given my hand and the current bid level.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is None, and I have two 9s in my hand. Starting with a conservative bid of 2 9s seems reasonable, as it's based on my own hand and leaves room for others to bid higher.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. I could bid 3 0s, which is the lowest possible bid that is higher. However, I have two 1s and four 4s. I will bid 3 1s. This is a safe bid and builds the count of 1s which I have in my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand and there are 24 unknown digits. The expected number of 6s among those is 24×0.1=2.4, so the total is likely around 4.4, making at least 3 very probable. Bidding 3 6s over 3 1s is a valid raise (same quantity, higher digit) with high confidence.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 3. I have a 6 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 6, increasing the quantity to 4 or more would be risky without knowing the other players' hands. However, I can increase the digit. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and is a valid higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which seems plausible given that there are 32 digits in total and 4 players. However, I don't have strong evidence to challenge, and I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 3 9s is a reasonable next step.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. I could bid 4 of any digit, or 3 of a digit higher than 9, which is not possible. Therefore, I will bid 4 0s, as 0 is a valid digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, making ‘5 6s’ a plausible increase. The current bid of 4 0s is likely true (≈71%), so challenging is risky. Instead, raising to 5 6s leverages my two 6s and an expected ≈2.4 unknown 6s (chance of at least three more ≈43%), making it a reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 3. I have a 6 in my hand, and I know there are 32 total digits remaining across all players. Given that there are 4 active players and each has 8 digits, I should assess the likelihood of there being 5 or more 6s. Since I only have one 6, and the maximum possible 6s from other players would be 3 (if they each had one), the total could be 4 at most from other players if I don't count my own. This makes 5 6s seem unlikely but not impossible. However, bidding 6 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. With three other players, it's possible that there are at least six 6s in total, but it's a risky bid. Given that the bid is already high and I don't have strong evidence to support a higher bid, challenging seems like the safer option.

Given that the previous bids have been aggressive and challenges have been successful, it's possible that the current bid is overestimating the actual count. I should challenge.
