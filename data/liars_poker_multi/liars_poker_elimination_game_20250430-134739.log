Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I can start with a cautious bid. My hand contains the digits 2, 5, 7, 8, 4, 6, 6, 4. Counting the total number of each digit in my hand: 2 (1), 4 (2), 5 (1), 6 (2), 7 (1), 8 (1). The highest count I have for any digit is 2 (for 4 and 6). To be safe and make a valid opening bid, I will bid 2 4s, as I know I have at least two 4s in my hand, and it's unlikely that the total count of 4s across all players is less than 2. This is a conservative opening bid, leaving room for others to increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. My hand has no 4s but includes a 5. Bidding 2 5s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Challenging the current bid would risk elimination if the actual count of 4s is ≥2, which is likely given the expected distribution of digits. Bidding 2 5s is a safer and valid move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand (15018497). With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. The current bid of '2 5s' is quite conservative, and given I already see one 5, it's very likely there is at least one more 5 among the other 40 digits I can't see. I can safely increase the bid while staying conservative. Since I have one 5, bidding '3 5s' would be risky, so I'll increase the digit instead to '2 6s', which I can do since I have one 6 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 4s and six other unique digits. Player 3 bid 2 7s. Since I have no 7s, I should increase the digit to a value I have, which is 4, but I should also increase the quantity to make a stronger bid. However, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48, and there are 6 players, each with 8 digits, so the maximum total digits is 48. Given that there are 3 bids already, the maximum possible quantity for this round is 48 - 3 * 2 = 42. Therefore, I should bid the maximum possible quantity and a digit I have, which is 4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 42 4s, which seems extremely high given that there are only 48 digits in total among all players. Since I have one 4 in my hand, I need to consider if this bid is plausible or if I should challenge it. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits total. If the bid of 42 4s is true, it would mean a large number of 4s. However, given that I only have one 4 and there are 5 other players, it seems unlikely that there are 42 4s in total. I should challenge this bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my turn as Player 5. I have 8 secret digits. I should make a conservative bid that is likely to be valid but not too high, given that we don't know the distribution of digits yet. I see I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 2 5s seems like a reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s, and I need to bid higher. Given my hand (2, 5, 7, 8, 4, 6, 6, 4), I have only one 5, so it's unlikely that there are more than 2 fives in total. Bidding 3 5s is risky, but I can consider bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity. Player 5 bid 2 5s, and I can challenge that bid if I believe it's unlikely, but my hand does contain a 5, so there's at least one. Bidding 2 6s would be higher than 2 5s, and I have two 6s, so I know there are at least two 6s in total, making that a safe bid. Alternatively, bidding 3 5s might be reckless given my hand. To maximize my chances, I'll bid 2 6s, which is a higher digit with the same quantity, or I can challenge if I think the previous bid is too high. Since I have two 6s, bidding 2 6s is valid and safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 2 6s. Bidding 2 7s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, following the pattern of previous bids (2 5s → 2 6s). Since I hold two 7s, even if other players have no 7s, the bid will be valid (total count = 2). Challenging the current 2 6s bid is risky, as the minimum plausible count is at least 2 (given 40 total digits).

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand (15018497). With 5 players having 8 digits each, the total count of 7s could reasonably be more than 2. Since I know of one 7 already, and there are 32 unknown digits among other players, it's safer to make a higher bid than to challenge. I'll bid 2 8s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit, which is a valid higher bid based on my hand containing an 8.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have a strong hand with one 8, one 5, one 4, one 1, one 0, one 9, one 7. Looking at the previous rounds, players have been starting conservatively with bids of 2. Since I'm starting this round and have one 4, bidding 2 4s is a safe opening move that leaves room for the bidding to progress while being likely true given my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s made by Player 2. I have 8 secret digits: 58447056. I can see that I have two 5s and one 4. Given that my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should consider the likelihood of higher bids. Since the current bid is 2 4s, I can increase either the quantity or the digit. I have two 5s, so bidding 3 5s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to 2 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have the digits 2, 5, 7, 8, 4, 6, 6, 4. Counting the 5s in my hand, I have only one 5. Given the total remaining digits are 32, and previous bids suggest that at least 3 5s exist, it's unlikely that the total count of 5s across all hands is 3 or more. Challenging now could be advantageous, as the actual count is probably less than 3, especially since I only have one 5 and others might not have many. Therefore, I will challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s by Player 5. Bidding 2 6s increases the digit value while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid and cautious move. Challenging the current bid would require believing there are fewer than 2 total 5s, which is unlikely given 3 players and my own 5. Bidding 2 6s leverages my known holdings while keeping pressure on opponents.

Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand (15018497), I have no 6s. With 3 players remaining and 8 digits each (24 total), Player 1 claims there are at least 2 sixes. Since I have none, this means Player 1 and Player 5 would need to have at least 2 sixes between them. While possible, I have seen aggressive play from Player 1 in previous rounds. Given I have zero 6s, I think there's a good chance Player 1 is bluffing and the total count of 6s is less than 2.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 1. I have two 6s in my hand. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, I should consider the possibility of challenging or making a higher bid. Since I have two 6s and the bid is 3 6s, it's possible that Player 1 has at least one 6. However, bidding higher requires a strategic approach. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 4 6s seems risky since there are only 16 digits in total and we have 8 digits each. A safer approach might be to challenge if I think 3 6s is unlikely, or bid on a different digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s by Player 5. I have two 7s in my hand (15396767), so the bid requires at least one 7 in Player 5's hand. The probability that Player 5 has zero 7s is ~43% (assuming random digits), making the bid likely false. Challenging offers a reasonable chance to win if the bid is incorrect, while bidding higher (e.g., 4 7s) would require Player 5 to have two 7s (~19% probability), which is less likely. A challenge is the optimal move.
