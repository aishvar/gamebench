Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since the current bid is 'None' and it's my turn to start bidding, I should make a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 2 6s seems like a safe starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '2 6s' by Player 0, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Looking at my hand, 50983149, I notice I have one 6. Since the bid must be higher, I could either increase the quantity or the digit. Considering the total number of digits is 48 and there are 6 players, it's plausible that there could be more 6s or even a significant number of higher digits. However, without more information about other players' hands, making a very high bid might be risky. A safe increase would be to bid on a higher digit with the same quantity or slightly increase the quantity for the same or a slightly higher digit. Given my hand doesn't offer a clear advantage in higher digits, and I only have one 6, bidding on a higher digit seems more prudent. Since my hand doesn't have any 7s, 8s, or 9s, and I don't want to bid too high without more confidence, I'll choose a digit that is higher than 6 but still reasonable given the distribution of digits in my hand and the potential distribution across all hands.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:1 - o3-2025-04-16) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I must raise either the quantity or, with the same quantity, the digit. I hold two 0s in my hand, so only one more 0 is needed among the 40 unknown digits to satisfy a bid of 3 0s. Given an expected average of about four of each digit in the unknown pool, the probability of at least one additional 0 is extremely high. Raising the quantity to 3 while choosing a digit I’m already strong in is both safe and incremental.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Given that there are 6 players and each has 8 digits, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. Bidding 3 1s is a reasonable next step, as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This bid is likely to be valid and puts pressure on the other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one '1' in my hand (digit '1') and the total remaining digits are 48. To beat the current bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one '1', I cannot raise the quantity to 4. The next higher digit after 1 is 2, but I have no '2's. Therefore, I cannot make a valid higher bid. Challenging the current bid seems logical, as the total number of '1's across all players is unlikely to be 3 or more, considering my hand and the previous bids.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is none. I can start with a bid based on the digits in my hand. I have one 9 in my hand. I can start with a bid of 2 9s, assuming others have at least one 9.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand and there are 32 unknown digits among the other players. The current bid of 2 9s is quite likely (expected ~3.2 nines), so challenging is risky. Bidding 3 3s is a minimal valid raise and strong since I hold three 3s and the expected total 3s is ~6.2, making 3 a safe bid.

Player 5 bids: 3 3s

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s made by Player 5. I have a hand of 69335868, which contains two 3s. Considering there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, the total number of digits is 40. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Given that I have two 3s and there are 4 other players, it's possible that the total count of 3s is at least 3. However, bidding 4 3s seems risky without more information. I can see that Player 3 previously bid 2 9s, which is lower than the current bid of 3 3s. I should bid higher than 3 3s. Since I have two 6s, bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it increases the digit value.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 3 6s and considering my hand 50983149, which does not contain any 6s, I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Since my hand doesn't support bidding on 6s and bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity or a higher quantity seems risky without more information, I should consider challenging the current bid. The total number of digits remaining is 40, and with 5 players, each having 8 digits, the distribution of digits is crucial. The bid of 3 6s might be reasonable but challenging it could provide insight into the game and potentially eliminate a player if the bid is unlikely. Given that I don't have enough information to make a confident higher bid and considering the potential risk and reward, challenging the bid seems like a strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my turn to start bidding. I have two 6s in my hand. Since there are no existing bids to compare with, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 2 6s seems reasonable as it's based on my actual hand.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:1 - o3-2025-04-16) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I already hold two 0s in my hand. With 24 unseen digits across the other three players, the chance that at least one more 0 exists is very high (over 90%). Challenging the current bid of 2 6s would be risky, since 2 of any digit in 32 total digits is quite probable and Player 0 likely has multiple 6s. Therefore, the safest and strongest play is to raise the quantity to 3 while choosing the digit I’m strongest in, namely 0.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. With 32 digits remaining across 4 players, it's plausible that there are at least 3 0s. However, bidding higher on 0s is risky. I have a 9 in my hand, and bidding 4 9s is a reasonable increase in both quantity and digit. This bid seems more likely to be true based on my hand and the remaining digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand. The bid of 4 9s requires at least four 9s among the other 24 unknown digits, which has under a 25% chance. The bid is unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand and with 16 unknown cards I expect at least one more 3 with probability over 80%. Opening with 4 3s is a strong, plausible bid.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s made by Player 5. I have 8 secret digits: 6, 9, 3, 5, 8, 6, 8, 6. I can see that I have two 6s and one 3. Given that there are only 24 digits in total and 3 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. The bid of 4 3s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. Since I have one 3 and two 6s, bidding 5 6s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit value compared to 4 3s.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:1 - o3-2025-04-16) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I see exactly one 6 in my hand. To satisfy the current bid of 5 6s, the 16 unknown digits held by Players 0 and 5 would have to contain at least four more 6s. With a random distribution the chance of that is roughly 7%. Even allowing for Player 0 possibly having an unusually 6-heavy hand, the probability the bid is true is still well under 30%. Any legal raise would require bidding 6 of some digit, which is riskier than calling. Challenging now offers the best chance of eliminating the bidder.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I begin the round and must make an opening bid. I hold exactly two 0s in my hand, which guarantees there are at least two 0s among the 16 total digits, regardless of what Player 5 has. By bidding "2 0s" the bid is certainly true for me, so I cannot lose if it is immediately challenged. At the same time, the quantity is low enough to leave plenty of space for future raises if needed.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand, so I'm guaranteed at least three 3s in total. Bidding 3 3s is a valid raise (quantity 3 > 2) and certain to be true, making any challenge by the opponent fail.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 3s in my hand, so the entire bid of 3 3s would have to come from Player 5’s eight digits. The chance that a random 8-digit hand contains three or more of the same specific digit is very small (around 4%). Even considering Player 5’s earlier willingness to bid 4 3s, it is still more likely than not that they hold fewer than three 3s now. Because I contribute none, the current bid is probably false, so challenging gives me the best chance to win this round.
