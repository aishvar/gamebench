Player 1 Reasoning: I have the following counts in my hand: 1 (0), 7 (1), 6 (2), 5 (3), 3 (4), 3 (5), 4 (6). Counting total 9s across all players is unlikely to reach 4, considering I have zero 9s and only one 6. The current bid is 3 9s, which I believe is quite high given the distribution. Challenging now seems prudent as the total number of 9s is unlikely to be 4 or more, especially with only 48 total digits and my hand having no 9s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s made by Player 0. I have 8 secret digits in my hand: 34035547. I see that I have one 0 in my hand. Considering there are 4 other active players and each has 8 digits, the total count of 0s could be higher. However, bidding immediately higher seems risky without more information. I will analyze my hand further and consider the total possible digits. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I need to calculate the feasibility of higher bids or the likelihood of the current bid being false. Given that I have one 0 and there are 40 digits in total, if the other players have a reasonable distribution, 3 0s might be achievable but not certain. A slightly higher bid seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 18068834, which contains one 0. The current bid is 4 0s, meaning at least four zeros among all 40 digits. With five players and 8 digits each, the expected average per digit is 4. I have only one 0, so there must be at least three more among the remaining 32 digits. This is possible but not guaranteed, and it's early in the round. Rather than challenge, I can safely raise the bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I choose to bid 4 1s, since I have one 1 and it's likely distributed similarly across all hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (61985779), I have 0 ones. Player 3 has bid that there are at least 4 ones among all players' hands. Since I have none, all 4 would need to be distributed among the other 4 players. This is certainly possible, but not guaranteed. However, challenging is risky at this early stage with a relatively low bid. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 7s. I'll bid 4 7s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value, which makes it a valid higher bid than 4 1s.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s. The current bid is 4 7s. Bidding 4 9s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 9s and challenges the previous bid's digit without increasing the quantity, making it a strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s made by Player 0. I have 8 secret digits in my hand: 34035547. I see that I have two 3s, one 4, two 5s, one 7. I do not have any 9s. Given that the bid is 5 9s and there are 5 active players with 8 digits each (total of 40 digits), it seems highly unlikely that there are 5 or more 9s in total. However, I must consider if there's a possibility of making a valid higher bid. Since my hand does not contain any 9s, I will have to bid on another digit. I have two 5s, and bidding on 5s seems reasonable. The current highest bid on 5s is 4 7s by Player 4, so I can bid higher than this. I can bid 5 5s, which would be a higher quantity than 4 and a higher digit than 0s, 1s, and 7s. But I need to be cautious about the likelihood of 5 9s being true and consider challenging.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s made by Player 0. I have 8 secret digits in my hand: 34035547. I count one 9 in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 40 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. The current bid of 5 9s seems high but not impossible. However, I do not have enough information about other players' hands. I will increase the quantity to make a bid of 6 0s, as I have three 0s in my hand and it's a relatively safe and low-risk increase.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. In my hand (18068834), I have one 0. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in play. The probability of there being 6 or more 0s is not impossible, but it's on the high side, especially since I've only seen one in my own hand. Given that players have repeatedly bid up 0s, there may be a bluff or players overestimating their 0 counts. Since I have only one 0 and the bid is already at 6, it's risky to bid higher without more evidence. I will challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round, there is no current bid to challenge. I need to open with a reasonable bid based on my hand. My hand is 18068834, which contains the following counts: 1 (1), 8 (2), 0 (1), 6 (2), 3 (1), 4 (1). The most frequent digits in my hand are 6 and 8, each appearing twice. With 32 digits in play (4 players), a starting bid of 3 of a digit is standard, but since I hold two 8s, bidding 3 8s is safe and not too aggressive for an opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze what I know about the game state. I have the hand 61985779, which contains two 7s, one 9, one 8, one 5, one 6, and one 1. The current bid is '3 8s' made by Player 3. Looking at my hand, I have one 8, so there need to be at least two more 8s among the other players' hands for this bid to be valid. With 4 players and 8 digits each, there are 32 total digits. The distribution of digits is generally random, so each digit would appear about 3.2 times on average. The bid of '3 8s' is very close to this average, making it quite reasonable. I could challenge, but it's risky given that I already have one 8 in my hand. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 7s. I could bid '3 9s', but I only have one 9. I could bid '4 7s', but I already bid that in the previous round. A safe option would be to bid '4 5s' or '4 6s', but I only have one of each. Given my confidence in 7s, I'll bid '4 7s'.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s. The current bid is 4 7s. Bidding 4 9s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, leveraging my existing 9s and the possibility that other players hold additional 9s. This is a logical progression in the bidding sequence.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, which is a valid higher bid. However, since I have two 9s, bidding 5 9s is also a valid higher bid and makes more sense given my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand (18068834). With 4 players and 8 digits each, there are 32 digits in play. The probability of there being at least 5 nines is not negligible, but I have no direct evidence from my hand to support raising the bid on 9s. However, I have three 8s in my hand, which is a high count relative to the total digits. Since the current bid is 5 9s, I can raise to 5 8s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, lower digit is not allowed, so I must raise quantity or digit; digit 8 is just below 9, so only quantity can be raised for 8s). Instead, I can bid 6 8s, leveraging my strong hand. This puts pressure on others, as I already hold half of the needed 8s myself.

Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '6 8s' made by Player 3. Looking at my hand (61985779), I have zero 8s. For the bid to be valid, there need to be at least 6 8s among all players. With 4 active players having 8 digits each, there are 32 total digits. I have 0 8s, so the other 3 players would need to have at least 6 8s between them, or an average of 2 8s per player. This is possible but somewhat high. Player 3 has bid 8s twice this round, first with '3 8s' and now with '6 8s', suggesting they might have several 8s. However, I notice I have three 7s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 7s. I could bid '7 7s', which would be higher than the current bid and leverage my strong holding in 7s. Alternatively, I could challenge, but since Player 3 seems confident in 8s, I'll make a higher bid instead.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. My hand has no 7s, and the expected number of 7s across all players is 3.2 (32 total digits * 1/10). This makes the bid highly unlikely. Challenging would expose the true count, and if it's below 7, I win. The risk of losing is lower than the potential reward of eliminating the bidder.

Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages my existing 9s. Challenging is risky without knowing Player 3's hand, but bidding 3 9s maintains pressure without immediate elimination risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 18068834, which contains one 9. There are 16 digits in total, so Player 5's bid of 3 9s requires there to be at least two more 9s in Player 5's hand. Given the low probability of Player 5 holding two or more 9s in their 8 digits, and that previous high 9s bids were successfully challenged, it's statistically unlikely this bid is valid. Therefore, I should challenge.
