Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since I'm the first to bid, I need to make a strategic opening bid. Looking at my hand (90316596), I have one 9, one 0, one 3, one 1, one 6, one 5, one 9 (again), and one 6 (again). So I have two 9s, two 6s, and one each of 0, 1, 3, and 5. A good opening strategy is to bid based on digits I have multiple of. With two 9s in my hand, I can reasonably expect there to be more 9s among other players. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each (48 total digits), and if digits were evenly distributed, each digit would appear about 4.8 times. I'll bid 5 9s, which is slightly above the statistical average but supported by my hand having two 9s already.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 6 0s, which means there would need to be at least 5 more 0s among the other 5 players (40 digits). Given the low probability of having that many 0s, challenging seems like the best move.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since the current bid is None and I'm starting the bidding, I should make a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 3 9s is reasonable as it's slightly higher than what I have, considering other players might also have 9s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have zero 9s, so challenging 3 9s succeeds only ~37% of the time. Instead I’ll raise to a digit I hold: I have two 1s, so bidding 4 1s requires only two more 1s among the other 32 cards. That has about an 84% chance of being valid, making this a safe raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains one 1 (from 07528719). The current bid is 4 1s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average number of any digit is 4. While it's possible there are four 1s, it's not guaranteed, and increasing the bid on 1s with only one in my hand feels risky. I have two 7s and one 8 and one 9. Bidding on one of these digits seems safer. A bid of 5 7s is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 53181467, containing one 7. The current bid is 5 7s, meaning there must be at least 5 sevens among all 40 digits. With only one 7 in my hand, it's unlikely that the other 4 players collectively have 4 or more 7s. Statistically, each digit appears about 4 times per player set, so 5 is a high bid for 7s. Therefore, challenging is the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: As the starting bidder this round, I need to open with any valid bid. My hand is 53181467, containing one of each digit except 2, 9, and 0. Starting with a moderate bid on a digit I hold is reasonable. I have one '1', and statistically, each digit should appear about 3 times across all hands (32 digits/10 digits ≈ 3.2). To avoid opening too aggressively, I will start with '3 1s', a safe and standard opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. In my hand, I have one 1 (in position 5). The current bid is '3 1s', which means Player 5 is claiming there are at least 3 ones among all players. With 4 active players having 8 digits each, there are 32 total digits. Since I have 1 one in my hand, there would need to be at least 2 more ones among the other 24 digits held by other players for the bid to be valid. This is quite reasonable - the expected number of 1s in 24 random digits would be about 2.4. Given that I have only one 1, I could either make a higher bid or challenge. I think making a higher bid is safer. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, one 0, one 3, one 1, one 6, one 5, and another 6. I could bid '3 3s' (increasing the digit) or '4 0s' (increasing the quantity). Since I only have one 3 and one 0, I'm not confident in either. I'll bid '3 5s' since I have one 5 and it's higher than 1s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand (from 24799519). The current bid is 3 5s by Player 0. With four players remaining and 32 total digits, it's plausible that there are at least three 5s in total. However, I don't have strong evidence to challenge. I can make a safe bid by increasing the digit to 6s, which I have one of in my hand. Bidding 3 6s is a conservative move that maintains the quantity but increases the digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: Challenging 3 sixes is risky (only ~30% chance to be wrong), and I hold one six. I can make the minimal higher bid by moving to 3 8s, and I have two 8s in my hand so only one more is needed among the other 24 cards (~92% chance).

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand, so there must be at least two more 8s among the other 24 digits for the bid to be valid. Statistically, that's plausible, so a challenge is not justified yet. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the digit (but 9 is the only higher digit, and I have no 9s) or increase the quantity. The safest next bid is to increase the quantity to 4 and select a digit I have, maximizing my chances. I have one each of 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Bidding 4 1s is reasonable, as 1s are common and I have one myself.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '4 1s' made by Player 5. Looking at my hand (90316596), I have only one 1 digit. For there to be at least 4 1s total, the other three players would need to have at least 3 more 1s between them, which is certainly possible. Player 5 initially bid '3 1s' and then raised to '4 1s' after a full round of bidding, suggesting they may have at least one 1 in their hand. Since I can't confidently challenge, I should make a higher bid. I have one 5, one 6, and one 9 in my hand, which gives me some confidence in these digits. I'll bid '4 5s' since it's the minimum valid raise and I have one 5 already.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s, which means there would need to be at least two more 5s among the other three players (total of 24 digits). Given that the previous bids have been relatively low and the game has seen several challenges, it's plausible that the actual count of 5s is close to the bid. However, with only two 5s in my hand, I'm not confident enough to bid higher. Challenging seems like the safer option to avoid elimination.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand and need only one more 8 among the 16 unknown cards to make 3 8s—a probability of about 81%. Bidding 3 8s increases the quantity and uses the highest safe digit I hold, forcing opponents to either bid 3 9s or jump to 4 of some digit, which is more difficult. This is a strong, safe bid to continue the game.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 53181467, which contains one 8. The current bid is 3 8s, so there need to be at least two more 8s among the other two players' 16 digits. The probability of that is not unreasonable, but not guaranteed. However, the bid is not excessive, and challenging here is risky unless I have zero 8s, which I do not. The best move is to make a higher bid. I have two 1s, so bidding 3 9s (same quantity, higher digit) or 4 1s (higher quantity, lower digit) are both valid. Since 9 is usually less common and I have no 9s, I prefer to bid 4 1s, leveraging my own hand strength.

Player 5 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this new round with only two players (16 total digits), I should make an opening bid that reflects my hand's strengths but doesn't overcommit. My hand is 53181467, which contains one of each digit except 2 and 9. The digit '1' appears once, as does every other digit except 2 and 9. Since there is no existing bid, I must start. A conservative but reasonable opening is '2 1s', since I have one and it's plausible the opponent has at least one as well, making a challenge unlikely.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 53181467. I have one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 2 2s, meaning there must be at least two 2s among both hands (16 digits total). Since I only have one 2, Player 3 would need to have at least one 2 for the bid to be valid. The probability that Player 3 has at least one 2 among their 8 digits is not negligible, but not guaranteed. However, challenging a bid of 2 for any digit at this stage is risky, as it's quite likely to be true. Instead, I will make a higher bid. The next valid bids are 2 3s, 2 4s, ..., or 3 1s. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding 3 1s is reasonable, as I only need Player 3 to have one 1 for the bid to succeed.
