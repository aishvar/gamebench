Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player to bid, I need to set the initial quantity and digit. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits. My hand is 30024393, containing three 3s, two 0s, and one each of 2, 4, and 9. The average expected count for any digit across 48 digits is 4.8. I have three 3s, which is my highest count. Bidding on a digit I hold many of reduces the risk. Bidding 5 3s is slightly above the average expectation but is reasonable given I hold 3 of them myself, meaning only 2 more 3s are needed from the remaining 40 digits held by other players. This is a solid starting bid based on my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains one 4. The current bid is 5 3s. Bidding 5 4s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity. Since I have one 4, it's plausible others have four more, making this bid reasonable. Challenging the 5 3s is risky as the expected number of 3s in remaining digits is 4, but the bid is at the threshold.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of '5 4s'. Looking at my hand (26017488), I have one 4 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For the bid of '5 4s' to be valid, there need to be at least 5 fours among all players. Since I have 1 four, that means the other 5 players would need to have at least 4 more fours among them, which is quite reasonable (less than 1 four per remaining player on average). Given that I know there's at least 1 four (in my hand), and the bid is only for 5 fours total out of 48 digits, this bid seems very reasonable and not worth challenging. I should make a higher bid. I have two 8s in my hand, which gives me some confidence to bid on 8s. I'll bid '5 8s', keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s made by Player 3. My hand contains one 9. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand only contains one 9, bidding a higher digit seems more feasible. I will bid 5 0s, as 0 is higher than 9 and I have a 0 in my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s made by Player 3. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than this. I have the digits 4, 7, 7, 1, 5, 2, 8, 7 in my hand. I can see that bidding higher on a digit or quantity is possible. Since I have two 7s, I can try to bid on 7s. Given that there are 6 players and each has 8 digits, there could be a reasonable chance that there are at least 6 7s in total. I will bid 6 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. My hand contains zero 8s. This means all 6 or more 8s must be present among the other 5 players' 40 digits. The expected number of 8s among 40 digits is 4. A bid of 6 is significantly above this expectation (2 above the mean). Challenging this bid is a strong move as my hand provides no support for it, and the bid quantity seems high relative to the expected count among the remaining digits. Bidding higher (e.g., 6 9s or 7 of any digit) would require even more unlikely concentrations of digits among other players, or rely heavily on digits I have few of.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round, so I must make a bid as the current bid is 'None'. My hand contains three 3s, which is my most frequent digit. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. The average expected count for any digit is 4. Bidding 5 3s is slightly above this average but is a reasonable opening bid given I hold three 3s myself and it sets a moderately high bar for subsequent players.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have a 4 in my hand and no 3s. The current bid is 5 3s. Bidding 5 4s increases the digit while maintaining the quantity. Since I hold one 4, and there are four other players, it's plausible there are enough 4s to meet the bid. Challenging carries risk if the actual count is 5 or more 3s, but bidding 5 4s is a safer, incremental move based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 2/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have my hand of 8 digits: 26017488. I notice I have two 8s, one 4, one 7, one 6, one 2, one 1, and one 0. The current bid is '5 4s' made by Player 1. Looking at my hand, I only have one 4, so there would need to be at least 4 more 4s among the other players to make this bid valid. With 5 players total and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. The probability of having at least 5 4s isn't extremely low. I could challenge, but it's risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Since I have two 8s in my hand, I feel confident bidding '5 8s', which is higher than '5 4s' because 8 is a higher digit than 4 while keeping the same quantity. This is also consistent with my bidding pattern from the previous round where I also bid '5 8s'.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s made by Player 3. My hand contains one 9 and other digits. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 9, bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit seems reasonable. I will bid 6 0s as 0 is a higher digit than 9 is not true, but 6 is a higher quantity than 5. Also, 0 is a valid digit that might be common.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. For the bid to be true, the other 4 players (with 32 digits) must have at least 4 more 0s. The average expectation for 0s among the other players is 32/10 = 3.2. Requiring 4 is slightly above average, making the bid plausible but not certain. My hand contains three 3s. Bidding 6 3s is a valid higher bid (same quantity 6, higher digit 3 > 0). If I bid 6 3s, the other 4 players would need at least 3 more 3s among their 32 digits. This requirement (3) is right around the average expectation (3.2), making 6 3s a very plausible total count. Bidding 6 3s leverages my strongest digit and seems safer than challenging 6 0s, which could potentially be true.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 3s in my hand, and the current bid is 6 3s. With 5 active players, the maximum possible 3s is 40, but realistically, the distribution is likely lower. Given my absence of 3s and the previous successful challenge on a similar bid (6 8s), it's plausible the current bid is a bluff. Challenging here balances risk and reward based on available information.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. Since there are three other players, it's plausible that there is at least one more 0 among their 24 digits. Bidding 3 0s is a conservative and reasonable starting bid based on my hand and the total digits available.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze whether to bid higher or challenge Player 1's bid of '3 0s'. Looking at my hand (26017488), I have one 0. Since there are 4 players with 8 digits each (32 total digits), and Player 1 bid that there are at least 3 zeros total, I need to decide if this is reasonable. With 1 zero in my hand, Player 1 would need to be claiming there are at least 2 more zeros among the other 24 digits (from Players 1, 3, and 4). This seems quite reasonable - having 2 zeros in 24 random digits is not unlikely. Since I don't have strong evidence to challenge, I should make a higher bid. I could bid '3 1s', but I don't have any 1s in my hand. I could bid '3 2s' and I do have one 2 in my hand. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to '4 0s', but that's riskier since I only have one 0. I'll go with '3 2s' as it's a safer bid based on my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have one 2 in my hand, but the bid requires at least three 2s total. Since I have a 3 in my hand, bidding 3 3s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages my existing digits to challenge the current bid without risking a direct challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits: 47715287. I see that I have one 3 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are only 4 players with 8 digits each (total of 32 digits), bidding a high quantity seems risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding a higher digit with a low quantity might be more reasonable. I have multiple high digits in my hand (4, 7, 7). Bidding 4 4s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid, and it's supported by my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have one 4 in my hand, so there need to be at least three 4s in the remaining 24 digits. The expected number of 4s in the remaining digits is 2.4, making the probability of three or more 4s approximately 43.5%. Since this is less than 50%, challenging is a reasonable risk. Bidding higher (e.g., 4 5s) would require a similar improbable scenario, so challenging is more strategic.

Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (26017488), I have one '0' digit. Player 1 has bid '3 0s', meaning they believe there are at least 3 zeros across all players' hands. Since I have 1 zero, there would need to be at least 2 more zeros between Player 1 and Player 3 for this bid to be valid. This seems reasonable, as the probability of having at least 2 zeros in 16 random digits is fairly high. I could challenge, but it's risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Based on my hand, I have two '8's, which gives me confidence to bid on that digit. I'll bid '3 8s', keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value.

Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (26017488), I have zero 9s. Player 3 has bid '3 9s', claiming there are at least 3 nines total between our hands. Since I have zero 9s, all 3 (or more) would need to be in Player 3's hand. This is certainly possible, as they could have anywhere from 0-8 nines. I could challenge, but it's risky since Player 3 might actually have 3 or more 9s. Alternatively, I could make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, one 7, one 6, zero 5s, one 4, one 2, one 1, and one 0. I could safely bid '4 0s' since that would require Player 3 to have at least 3 zeros (I only have one), which seems unlikely. Or I could bid '4 8s' which would require them to have at least 2 eights (I have two). Given the distribution of digits, I'll bid '4 0s' as it's a reasonable increase that forces Player 3 into a potentially difficult position.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. My hand is 26017488, which contains two 8s, one 7, one 6, one 4, one 2, one 1, and one 0. Importantly, I have zero 9s in my hand. The current bid from Player 3 is '4 9s', meaning they're claiming there are at least 4 nines between our combined hands. Since I have zero 9s, this means Player 3 would need to have at least 4 nines in their hand of 8 digits. While this is technically possible, it seems quite unlikely that they would have 4 or more of the same digit. Given that I have no 9s to contribute to this count, I think challenging is the best move here.
