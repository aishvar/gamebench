Player 1 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made and the current bid is 'None', I can start with a reasonable bid. I have three 2s in my hand. Bidding 4 2s seems like a conservative and strategic opening bid, as it's likely there are at least four 2s among all players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I hold three 8s in my hand and the current bid is 4 2s by Player 1. Raising to 4 8s (same quantity, higher digit) leverages my strong holding. With 32 unseen digits and p=0.1, there’s roughly a 96% chance of at least one more 8, making a total of 4 8s very likely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 8s and I have to make a strictly higher bid, I must consider either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains no 8s but does contain other digits, and considering the total number of digits remaining is 40, bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity seems more plausible. However, I must also consider the likelihood of higher digits appearing more frequently than 8s. Given that I have multiple 6s and 7s in my hand, and without exact knowledge of other players' hands, it's reasonable to assume that digits like 6 or 7 could be as common or more common than 8, given their presence in my hand. Thus, a bid of 4 9s would be a higher bid, but without any 9s in my hand, this could be risky. Considering the safer option and the fact that I need to make a higher bid, I could consider bidding on a digit that I have more information about, like the 6, but I must increase the quantity since I cannot bid on the same digit with the same quantity as the previous bid. However, increasing quantity without having a clear indication of the distribution of digits among other players is risky. Given these considerations and the need to make a decision based on limited information, challenging the current bid might be the safest option, especially since the bid of 4 8s seems somewhat high given the total number of digits and the fact that I don't have any 8s in my hand, which might indicate 8s are not as common. But, considering the rules and the aim to make a strategic move, bidding higher on a digit I have more control over or knowledge about seems like a viable strategy, especially if I consider digits that are likely to appear frequently. Since I have to make a higher bid and challenging is an option but depends heavily on the actual distribution of digits, I will choose to bid higher on a digit that I believe could plausibly match or exceed the bid quantity, taking into account the distribution of digits I've seen and the total remaining digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 5 6s, which means there would need to be at least four more 6s among the other four players (total of 32 digits). Given the low probability of this, I should challenge the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Since the current bid is None and I'm the first to bid in this round, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 2 8s is a safe starting point, as I know there are at least two 8s in play.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 91184592, which contains one 8. The current bid is 2 8s by Player 4. With 32 total digits across 4 players, it's plausible that there are at least 2 eights in play, especially since I have one. I don't see a strong reason to challenge as the bid is quite low and reasonable. Instead, I will make a higher bid. Since I also have two 9s in my hand, bidding on 9s seems like a safe choice. I will bid 3 9s, increasing both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 2 8s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Given that the highest bid so far was 5 6s (which failed), I think it's unlikely that there are 3 9s among all players. Therefore, I should challenge the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet in this round and I am starting the bidding, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand is 91184592, which gives me two 9s, two 1s, and one each of 8, 4, 5, and 2. Bidding on 9s seems like a safe choice since I have two of them, and with 24 total digits across three players, it's plausible there could be at least one more 9 in the other hands. I will bid 3 9s to start the round, as it is a reasonable estimate and forces the next player to bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand and no 9s, so challenging 3 9s is risky. To outbid 3 9s I must go to quantity 4; bidding 4 8s is strong since I only need one more 8 among the 16 unknown cards, which is likely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which is already high given that there are only 24 digits in total. With two 8s in my hand, it's possible that the other players have two more 8s combined, making the bid valid. However, the bid is quite aggressive, and challenging it could be a good move if I think the other players don't have enough 8s. Given the risk, I'll make a conservative higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 4. In my hand, I have three 9s (out of my 8 digits), which means there are already 3 of the required 4 9s accounted for just in my hand. With a total of 24 digits across all three players, it’s quite plausible that there is at least one more 9 among the remaining 16 digits held by Player 2 and Player 4. Challenging this bid seems risky since the likelihood of there being at least 4 9s is high. Instead, I will make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 4 9s, I can increase the quantity to 5 and bid on any digit. I’ll bid 5 9s to stay with a digit I have strength in, as I already have 3 9s, making the bid somewhat believable while pushing the risk onto the next player.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have 0 nines in my hand and there are only 16 unknown cards; getting 5 nines among them is extremely unlikely (around 1–2% probability). The bid of 5 9s is almost certainly a bluff, so I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains three 8s. Opening with 3 8s is safe: I guarantee at least three 8s, even if my opponent has none, and it’s the strongest opening bid I can confidently make.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which means Player 2 is claiming there is at least one more 8 in their hand. Since there are only two players left, the maximum possible 8s is 4 (if both players have two 8s each). Given that I have two 8s, it's plausible that Player 2 has at least one 8, making the bid valid. To increase the bid, I can bid 4 8s, which is a higher quantity and still within the possible range.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand, so Player 4 must have at least one 8 among their eight cards for the bid of 4 8s to be valid. The probability they have no 8s is (0.9)^8≈0.43, so I stand about a 43% chance of winning a challenge. Any raise to 5 8s or 4 9s is even less likely to succeed. Therefore I should challenge.
