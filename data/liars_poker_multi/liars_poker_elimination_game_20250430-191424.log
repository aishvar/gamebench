Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no previous bid has been made, I can start with a reasonable opening bid. My hand contains the digits 8, 6, 2, 8, 3, 5, 9, 6, which include counts of 8s (2), 6s (2), 2s (1), 3s (1), 5s (1), 9s (1). To be cautious yet assertive, I will bid 3 8s, which is a plausible minimum based on my hand. This sets a baseline for others to challenge or raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one '8' in my hand. Given there are 48 digits total, 3 eights is a reasonable and low bid. To increase the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since increasing the quantity to 4 might be risky with only one 8, I can bid 3 9s, which is a higher digit at the same quantity. I have no 9s, but bidding 3 9s is a valid and safer increment.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 1. I have a 9 in my hand. Bidding 4 9s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, the average count for any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8.  A bid of 4 9s is close to the average, but it's possible, especially if other players have multiple 9s. I have a 0, two 2s, a 3, a 4, a 5, a 1, and a 9. I have two 2s, which is above average for a single digit in my hand. Bidding on 2s seems like a safer option than challenging or bidding higher on 9s. I can bid 5 2s, which is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 5 2s, which means there would need to be at least four more 2s among the other five players (total of 40 digits). Given that 2s are not particularly common and the previous bids have been focused on higher digits (8s and 9s), it's unlikely there are that many 2s. Challenging seems like the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 4s and two 9s in my hand. Since the current bid is None and I'm starting the bidding, I should make a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 3 9s is reasonable as I have two 9s and there are four other players who might have at least one more 9.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I hold two 9s in my hand, and with 32 unknown digits it’s highly likely there are at least two more 9s among the other players, so bidding 4 9s is reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, and I hold the digits 8, 6, 2, 8, 3, 5, 9, 6. I have only one 9 in my hand, so it's impossible for the total to be 4 or more. Bidding higher on 9s (like 5 9s) is unlikely to be true, and challenging now could be a good move since the total count of 9s across all players is probably less than 4. Challenging seems the safest and most strategic choice.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand and with 32 random digits the expected total count of 9s is about 3.2. Given I already hold two, it’s highly likely there’s at least one more among the other 24 cards. Opening with 3 9s is a safe yet assertive bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I must bid higher than 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, which supports the bid to some extent. The next valid higher bids are either 4 0s or 4 1s, etc. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding 4 1s is reasonable and increases quantity, making it a solid bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have a 1 in my hand. I will make a bid of 5 1s, increasing the quantity to match my hand's digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one '1' in my hand. The current bid is '5 1s', which seems high given that there are only 32 digits remaining and only 4 players left. The probability that there are at least five '1's across all hands is low, especially since previous bids have been challenged and found to be overestimates. Therefore, challenging the bid is the best move.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is None, and I have two 9s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 3 9s seems reasonable, as it's a moderate bid that could be supported by the other players' hands given the history of 9s being bid in previous rounds.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, so to raise I must go to at least 4 of any digit. Bidding 4 9s is the most plausible since I only need two more 9s among the 16 unknown digits, which is more likely than any other 4-of-a-kind bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, which makes the bid plausible but not certain. To raise the bid, I must bid at least 4 0s or higher quantity. I have two 0s in my hand, which supports bidding 4 0s. Bidding 4 0s is a valid higher bid and reasonable given my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Increasing the quantity to 5 0s is the next valid higher bid since 0 is the lowest digit and 5 is higher than 4. This bid is plausible because 5 total 0s among 24 digits is reasonable and I have a 0 in my hand, supporting the bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand (74499813). With only 24 total digits remaining and the current bid being 5 0s, it's unlikely that there are 5 0s across all players' hands. Challenging seems like the best move.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, so for the bid of 3 9s to hold the opponent needs at least one 9 in their 8 cards, which is only about a 57% chance. Raising to 4 9s is even less plausible (~19% chance) and would almost certainly be challenged. It's best to call the current bid.
