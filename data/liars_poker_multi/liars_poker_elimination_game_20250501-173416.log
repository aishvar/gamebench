Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning I can make any initial bid. I should look for a digit in my hand that could be reasonably bid on, considering the total number of digits available (48) and the number of players (6). My hand is 18744239. I have two 4s, which seems like a good starting point. Bidding 2 4s seems reasonable as it's based on my own hand and not overly aggressive for an initial bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current game state. The current bid is '2 4s', meaning Player 0 believes there are at least 2 fours among all players' hands. Looking at my own hand (73287705), I have zero 4s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. Since I don't have any 4s, all 4s must be in other players' hands. The current bid is quite low (only 2 4s), which is very reasonable and likely true given the total number of digits. I should make a higher bid. I have two 7s and one 8 in my hand, which gives me confidence in bidding on these digits. I'll bid '3 7s' which is higher than '2 4s' and I already know I have two 7s in my hand, so I only need one more 7 among the other 40 digits held by other players, which is quite likely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I don't have any 7s in my hand. I could bid 3 8s, but that's risky. I could also bid 4 of any digit. Given the limited information, I'll play it safe and bid 4 0s, as I have two 0s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s, which means at least four zeros in total. I have no zeros in my hand (3,4,3,8,7,4,2,5). The previous bids have increased from 2 4s to 3 7s to 4 0s. Since zeros are relatively rare and I have none, the bid of 4 zeros might be plausible but not overly strong. I can increase the bid by moving to 4 2s because I have two 2s in my hand, which supports the bid. This is a valid higher bid since the quantity is the same but the digit is higher than 0. Bidding 4 2s is a reasonable step up and keeps the pressure on the next player.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have the digits 3, 4, 3, 8, 7, 4, 2, 5 in my hand. The digit 4 appears twice, and 3 appears twice. Since the total digits are 40 across 5 players, bidding 3 4s is a reasonable and safe starting bid, as it is likely that at least three 4s exist in total.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. To reach a total of four 2s, at least two of the 32 unknown digits must be 2s. The probability of at least two 2s among 32 cards is about 84%, making this a plausible bid. Since 4 is greater than the current bid quantity of 3, this is a valid raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s made by Player 5. I have 8 secret digits: 18744239. I count one 2 and two 4s in my hand. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40 and there are 40 total digits remaining, a bid of 4 2s seems plausible but not extremely high. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 5 4s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and utilizes the digits I have.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 3/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze if Player 0's bid of 5 4s is reasonable. In my hand of 73287705, I have 0 fours. There are 40 total digits in play. Player 0 previously bid 2 4s in the last round, and Player 3 started this round with 3 4s before Player 0 increased to 5 4s. This suggests Player 0 might have some 4s. However, for there to be 5 fours total, and I have none, the other 4 players would need to have an average of 1.25 fours each, which is possible but getting less likely. Given that I have none, and the bid has increased from 3 to 5 in this round, I think it's worth challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my turn to start bidding. I have the hand 18744239, which contains two 4s. Given that there are 4 active players and each has 8 digits, I should make a conservative but reasonable bid based on my hand. Bidding 2 4s seems like a good starting point as it reflects the number of 4s I have.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. I could bid 3 4s, but I think I can bid higher with a different digit. I have one 0, one 6, one 8, one 9, one 1, and one 2. I will bid 3 0s, increasing the quantity and changing the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s by Player 2. I have one '4' in my hand and no '0's. The previous bid was 2 4s by Player 0, so bidding higher than 3 0s means either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since 3 is the quantity, I can bid 3 1s or higher digit with same quantity. I have one '4' and one '5' and one '7' in my hand, so bidding 3 4s is reasonable, as the previous bid was 2 4s and now bidding 3 4s increases the quantity and is consistent with my hand. Therefore, I will bid 3 4s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. To outbid 3 4s I can raise the quantity to 4 2s. There are 24 unknown digits and the chance of seeing at least two more 2s among them is about 70%, making 4 2s a strong, statistically backed bid.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s made by Player 5. I have 8 secret digits: 18744239. I count 2 fours and 1 two in my hand. Given that there are 32 digits in total and 4 players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. The current bid of 4 2s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. Since my hand contains 2 fours, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems feasible. I can bid 5 4s, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have one 0 in my hand. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. I will increase the quantity to 6 and keep the digit as 0. This is a valid bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s by Player 2. I have one 4 in my hand and no zeros. The previous bids show some confidence in 4s and 2s, but 6 zeros is a high count. Since zeros are less common in my hand and the bid is already quite high, I will raise the bid to 7 0s, increasing the quantity to maintain pressure and show confidence.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one zero in my hand, leaving 31 unknown digits. To meet a total of 7 zeros, at least 6 of those 31 must be zeros. The probability of that is very low (around 7–8%). It’s highly likely the bid is false, so I should challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s made by Player 5. I have the digits 2, 4, 4, 3, 9 in my hand, which means I have one 2. Given that there are only 24 digits in total and 3 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. The current bid of 3 2s seems plausible but not extremely high. However, I do not have enough information about the other players' hands. I will bid slightly higher than 3 2s by increasing the quantity while choosing a digit that I have in my hand.
