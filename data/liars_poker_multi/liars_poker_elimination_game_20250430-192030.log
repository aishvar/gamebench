Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 3 4s is a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that other players have at least one 4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Player 0 bid 3 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. Bidding 4 4s would be a lie and potentially risky. I have two 6s, so bidding 4 6s is a reasonable option, increasing the digit significantly. Alternatively, I could bid 3 5s, which is a valid increase in digit. However, given I have two 6s, 4 6s seems more strategically sound as it leverages my hand. Since I have no 4s, challenging is also a viable option, but it's early in the game and challenging immediately might not be optimal. Therefore, I will bid 4 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is None, meaning no bid has been made yet this round. I have two 6s in my hand. A conservative bid, considering I want to avoid an early challenge, would be to bid 1 of a digit I have. I'll bid 1 6, as it's a low quantity and I have two of them, making it somewhat plausible. Since the previous round involved 6s and I won the challenge, I'm slightly more confident in bidding 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is a very low 1 6s. My hand contains two 5s. Bidding 2 5s is a safe and valid higher bid, as I know there are at least two 5s among the total digits, and a quantity of 2 is higher than the current quantity of 1.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand and the current bid of 2 5s is low. By bidding 3 9s I only need one more 9 among the 32 unknown digits, which is very likely, and it strictly increases the quantity over the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The average total per digit across all players is four, making a bid of 4 9s reasonable. Increasing the quantity from the previous bid of 3 9s follows logically.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have two 9s in my hand, which is a strong indication that 9s are likely to be high in frequency. However, bidding on 9s again seems risky as it might be challenged. I have one 5 in my hand. Bidding 5 5s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This bid is likely to be safe and can potentially win if challenged.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Bidding higher than 5 5s requires either increasing the quantity to 6 or more, or keeping the quantity at 5 and increasing the digit to 6 or more. Given that there are only 40 total digits across 5 players (8 each), it's unlikely there are 6 or more 5s. I have two 6s, so bidding 6 6s is a reasonable option. It's a slight increase in quantity and digit, and it's plausible given my hand.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:5 - openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains two 5s. The current bid is 6 6s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the digit for the same quantity (6 7s, 6 8s, 6 9s) or increase the quantity (7 of any digit). Based on my hand, bidding 7 of a digit I have multiple of (like 1s or 5s) is more plausible than increasing the digit to 7, 8, or 9 with only one or zero of those in my hand. I have two 1s and two 5s. The previous bid sequence included 5 5s, suggesting a potential concentration of 5s among other players. Bidding 7 5s is a plausible increase from 6 6s, leveraging my hand strength and the recent history.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have only one 5 in my hand, so the other four players hold 32 unknown digits. They would need 6 of those to be 5s to meet the bid of 7. The expected number of 5s among 32 digits is 3.2 with a probability of about 11% to have 6 or more. Since the current bid is highly unlikely, I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. With 32 total digits and 24 unknown, we expect about 2.4 additional 9s, for around 4.4 total. Bidding 3 9s only requires at least one of those unknown to be a 9 (~91% probability) and being the highest digit for quantity 3 forces the next bid to jump to quantity 4, making it a safe, aggressive opening.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Given the statistical likelihood that the total count of 9s across all four players' hands is at least 3 (especially considering Player 4's bid), challenging would be risky. Bidding 4 9s leverages my own holdings and applies pressure on opponents, as the expected total of 9s in 32 digits likely exceeds 4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. With 32 digits remaining, it's plausible that there are at least 5 9s in total. Challenging seems risky, so I should bid higher. Bidding 5 9s is a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity of the current digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Given that there are only 32 total digits remaining across 4 players (8 digits each), and Player 4 and 5 already bid 3 and 4 9s respectively, it's highly unlikely there are 5 9s in total. While I could bid higher, challenging seems like the more strategic play. The previous rounds show players are willing to challenge, and 5 9s feels like a bluff.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None'. I have two 4s in my hand. Given the previous bids and eliminations, it's reasonable to start with a modest bid. Bidding 3 4s is a safe start, as it's likely there are at least three 4s among all players' hands.

Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid of the round and the current bid is 'None', I can start with a reasonable bid. I have two 5s in my hand. Given the bidding history, starting with a bid of 3 5s seems like a safe and strategic move, as it's likely that Player 5 also has at least one 5.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have no 5s in my hand (49033819), so all 5s must be in Player 0's hand. For the bid to be valid, Player 0 needs at least 3 5s. Assuming random distribution, the probability of Player 0 having ≥3 5s in their 8-digit hand is very low (~3.7%). Challenging this bid is statistically favorable, as the actual count is likely below 3.
