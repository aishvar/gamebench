Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7, one 3, one 5, one 1, one 6, one 9, and two other digits in my hand. Since no bids have been made yet, I should start with a reasonable bid. Given the distribution of digits and the total of 48 digits in play, bidding 2 7s is a modest and plausible start, as I have one 7 and other players might have some too.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I will increase the quantity. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and I have two 7s in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. To beat the current bid of 3 7s I can keep the quantity at 3 and raise the digit to 8. That only requires at least one more 8 among the 40 unknown digits, which is very likely, while making the smallest possible increase and preserving future flexibility.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand (29470770). The current bid is 3 8s, which means there would need to be at least three 8s among the other five players' hands (40 digits). While possible, it's a risky bid given that 8s are not particularly common. However, challenging now might be premature since the bid is still relatively low. A safer move would be to increase the bid slightly to 3 9s, which is a higher digit but same quantity, based on my hand which has one 9.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s. With 48 digits in play and only one 9 in my hand, it is plausible that there are at least three 9s among all players, so challenging now is risky. To make a valid higher bid, I can increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, I must increase the quantity. I will bid 4 1s, since I have two 1s in my hand, and 1s are generally common, making this a safer incremental bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have no 1s in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 1s seems reasonable. I have two 5s, so I can bid 5 5s, increasing the quantity. This is a plausible bid given I have two 5s, and there are 5 other players with 8 digits each, meaning there are 38 digits remaining that could potentially be 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Considering the total of 48 digits, having at least five 5s is plausible but somewhat high. To increase the bid, I must either bid at least 6 0s or higher, or 5 6s or higher. I do not have any 6s or higher digits in sufficient quantity, but I do have one 7. Bidding 5 6s is possible but risky. Bidding 6 0s would be a safer higher bid. Since 0s are not in my hand, but the bid is only one more than the current quantity, 6 0s is a reasonable bid to keep the game going without overcommitting. Therefore, I will bid 6 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s made by Player 0. I have 8 digits in my hand: 2, 8, 8, 4, 7, 4, 0, 2. I see that there are two 0s in my hand. Given that the bid is 6 0s, I need to assess if it's likely or not. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits in total. If we assume an even distribution, 0s could reasonably exist across players. However, I must consider if bidding higher or challenging is optimal. My hand contains two 0s, and bidding higher seems feasible. I will bid 8 0s as my next action, increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I see only one 0 in my eight-digit hand. That means the other 40 hidden digits would have to contain at least seven 0s for Player 1’s bid of 8 0s to be correct. Under a fair distribution the expected number of 0s in 40 digits is 4, and the probability of there being 7 or more is roughly 10%. Even allowing for Player 0 and Player 1 possibly holding a few extra 0s, the odds still strongly favor the total being under 8. Challenging now gives me an estimated 70-90% chance to win, which is far better than making a shaky higher bid that could backfire.

Player 2 Reasoning: I open the round, so I need to place the first bid. My hand contains two 8s. Out of the remaining 32 unknown digits, the expected count of 8s is about 3 (10 % of 32). The chance that there are at least two additional 8s—giving a total of four or more—is roughly 85 %, which is comfortably safe for an opening bid. Starting with 4 8s raises the quantity to a solid level while still being believable and leaves me room to adjust if the bidding climbs.

Player 2 Reasoning: I’m the first to act this round, so I must make an opening bid. With 32 total digits in play, the expected count for any given digit is about 3.2. I already hold two 8s (81801449), so I only need at least one more 8 among the 24 unknown digits for the bid to be valid. The probability of there being at least one 8 in 24 random digits is over 90%, making “3 8s” a comfortably safe and modest opening that doesn’t reveal too much or invite an immediate challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 4 9s would be a reasonable increase in quantity, but I only have one 9, making it a risky bid. Bidding 3 0s would increase the digit, but I only have two 0s. Bidding 4 0s would be too high given my hand. Bidding 3 8s would be a valid bid, but Player 2 already bid 3 8s and won a previous challenge on that digit. Bidding 4 1s would be a valid bid, but I have no 1s. Bidding 4 5s would be a valid bid, and I have two 5s. Bidding 4 6s would be a valid bid, and I have one 6. Considering the limited information and my hand, bidding 4 5s seems like the most reasonable option to increase the bid without being overly aggressive.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable step up since I have a 6 in my hand and it raises the digit without increasing the quantity too much. This keeps the bid plausible given the total digits and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 8s (hand: 81801449). To meet a bid of 4 8s we would need just two more 8s among the remaining 24 hidden digits. With a random distribution each digit appears about 10 % of the time, so the chance of at least two more 8s is roughly 70 %, making this bid fairly safe. Challenging the current bid of 4 6s looks tempting, but even with none in my hand there is still about a 25-30 % chance that four 6s exist, a bigger risk than bidding. Raising to 4 8s is strictly higher (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages the strength of my hand while avoiding an immediate 1-in-3 elimination risk.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which means there need to be at least three more 8s among the other 24 digits. This is plausible, as there are on average 2.4 of each digit among the unseen digits, but it's not a strong hand for 8s. However, the previous challenge against a Player 2 8-bid failed, so players may be cautious. I have two 9s, making a bid of 4 9s relatively safe, as the probability that there are at least two more 9s among the remaining 24 digits is reasonable. Therefore, I will raise to 4 9s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 9s is necessary. I could bid 5 9s, but that's risky given I only have one. I could bid a lower quantity with a higher digit, but the history shows players are bidding high quantities. Considering I have two 5s, I can bid 5 5s, which is higher than the previous bid of 4 9s. This seems like a reasonable and safe bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s, and I have only one 5 in my hand. Given that there are 32 digits total and the bidding has been gradually increasing, 5 occurrences of 5 seem plausible. I do not have strong evidence to challenge, so I need to make a higher bid. The next valid bids must be either a higher quantity or the same quantity but a higher digit. I can bid 5 6s since 6 is higher than 5 and the quantity remains the same. I have one 6 in my hand, which slightly supports this bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 6s in my 8-digit hand, so all five (or more) 6s would have to be in the 24 unknown digits held by the other three players. With a random distribution, the expected number of 6s in those 24 digits is only about 2–3, and the chance of there being at least 5 is well under 10%.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. With 24 digits in play and two unknown hands, the expected number of 8s across all hands is about 2.4 (24 digits * 1/10 per digit). The current bid is 3 8s, which is slightly above the average expectation and I only have one. While it's possible the other players could have more, the probability is not high. Additionally, Player 2 has shown a tendency to make aggressive but not outrageous bids, and the previous round's challenge on a similar quantity was successful for the challenger.

Player 5 Reasoning: Player 2 bid 2 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable increase, as it maintains the digit and increases the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit, but given the recent history of 8s being bid and succeeding, it seems strategically sound to continue with 8s. I have no 9s, so bidding on those is not an option. Bidding on 5s would require me to believe there are at least 6 total, and while I have two, it's risky.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I already hold two 8s, so the bid only requires my opponent to have at least one 8 out of their eight unknown digits. Assuming a uniform distribution, the chance they have no 8s is (9/10)^8 ≈ 43%, meaning the bid is true only about 57% of the time. Any legal raise (e.g., 3 9s or 4 of anything) would be even less likely to be correct given my hand and would almost certainly be challenged, putting me at a bigger disadvantage. A 43% chance to win the game by challenging is preferable to making a riskier bid that is likely to be called. Therefore, I should challenge.
