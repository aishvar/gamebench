Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first bidder and the current bid is None. I have two 1s and two 6s in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. A reasonable starting bid is often based on your hand and the average expected count of a digit (48 / 10 = 4.8). Since I have two 1s and two 6s, bidding 3 1s or 3 6s is a safe start. Bidding 3 1s is slightly lower and leaves more room for future bids.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have a lot of information about other players' hands, I'll play it safe. I can see that there's at least one 1 in my hand, and the previous round had 8 ones in total. It's likely that the total count of 1s is still relatively high. I will increase the quantity to 4 and keep the digit the same, making it 4 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one '1' in my hand (from 99960527). The current bid is '4 1s'. Given that the previous challenge revealed 8 '1s' when there were 48 total digits (1 in 6 digits), and now there are 40 total digits, it's reasonable to estimate around 6-7 '1s' in total. Since the bid is '4 1s', which is likely true, I should make a higher bid. I can bid '4 2s' (increasing the digit) or '5 1s' (increasing the quantity). I choose '5 1s' as it's a safer increase based on the previous count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 1. The current bid claims there are at least 5 ones total among all players. From the previous round, we know there were at least 8 ones when there were 6 players. Even after one player was eliminated, it's very likely there are still at least 5 ones total. Since I have one 1 myself, and the previous challenge revealed a high count of 1s, the current bid of 5 1s seems reasonable. I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, which could be a good basis for a bid. I'll bid 5 0s, keeping the same quantity but using a higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 2/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand (15072601). The current bid of 5 1s means there need to be at least 4 more 1s among other players' hands. In the previous round, when Player 2 challenged 4 1s, there were actually 8 1s total. Even though one player was eliminated, this suggests there are likely still enough 1s to support the current bid of 5 1s. I can safely bid 5 2s, which is a valid higher bid keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 1s, one 3, one 4, one 5, two 6s, and one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 5 2s.  There are 5 players remaining, so there are 40 total digits.  A bid of 5 of any digit represents a 12.5% probability (5/40).  While 5 2s is a reasonable bid, I have no 2s in my hand.  Looking at my hand, I have two 1s and two 6s.  Bidding 5 6s is a valid higher bid and is plausible given I hold two 6s and there are 40 total digits.  Bidding 6 1s is also possible, but 6 6s is a higher quantity and digit based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (91841349). The total count of 6s across all players must be at least 2 (my 6s) + 1 (previous bidder's minimum possible count, as Player 1 bid 6 6s after seeing Player 0's 5 6s). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s, bidding 7 6s seems plausible as it increases the quantity. However, considering the total digits remaining (40) and that there are 4 other players, the total count of 6s could be reasonably higher than 6. Thus, bidding 7 6s is a reasonable next step.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 7 6s, which is quite high given there are only 40 digits in total and 5 players. The probability that there are at least 7 6s across all hands is low, especially since only one 6 is in my hand. Therefore, challenging the bid seems like the best move.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is None, and I have three 9s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 3 9s is a strong opening move given my hand strength and the fact that 9s are less common than lower digits, making it harder for others to challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: In my hand, I have only one 9. Given there are 32 total digits and 4 players, even if others have some 9s, the bid of 3 9s seems reasonable. Based on the previous rounds, players have been fairly conservative with their bids. Looking at my hand (15072601), I could bid 4 0s since I have one 0, but that would be risky without more information. I could also bid 3 higher than 9s, but that's impossible. Since the bid seems plausible and I don't have strong evidence to challenge, I'll make a safe increase to 4 0s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (15072601). With 3 players total and 24 digits in play, the maximum possible 6s would be 8 per player. The current bid of 3 6s is quite reasonable. Given my one 6, and that Player 1 has shown confidence in 6s in previous rounds (and was correct about having 6s before), it's safer to make a higher bid than challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 56648113. The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 8 in my hand. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the average count for any digit is 2.4.  A bid of 3 7s is slightly above average but not unreasonable.  I could bid 3 8s, which is a valid higher bid.  However, I have two 6s and two 1s, which are stronger digits for me to bid on. Bidding 4 1s or 4 6s seems more strategic given my hand and the current bid.  Bidding 4 6s is a higher quantity and the same digit as the previous bid, which is a valid and reasonable increase based on my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: In my hand, I only have one 6. The current bid claims there are 5 sixes total among all players. Given there are only 3 players left with 8 digits each (24 total), and I can see only 1 six in my hand, there would need to be 4 more sixes between the other two players. While possible, this seems unlikely given the distribution. Additionally, Player 1's aggressive bidding from 3 to 5 sixes suggests potential bluffing. Historical rounds show Player 1 has made bold bids before. Given these factors and my knowledge of only 1 six, challenging seems optimal.

Four 6s is above the expected value, but not excessively high given the previous bidding on 6s and the fact that Player 1 has been bidding up the 6s. I have two 6s, so Player 1 would only need two more 6s for the bid to be true. Bidding 5 6s is a small increase and still plausible, especially if Player 1 has a 6. Alternatively, I could challenge, but Player 1 has shown a willingness to bid on 6s, suggesting they might have one or more. Bidding 5 6s seems like a reasonable next step given my hand and the bidding history.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 6s. The current bid is 6 6s. With only 16 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 1.6 (16 / 10). A bid of 6 6s is significantly higher than this average.  Player 1 has been steadily increasing the bid on 6s. Given my two 6s, it's plausible Player 1 has at least four 6s to justify this bid. However, it's a high bid in a two-player game. I have two 1s, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 8. I could bid 6 8s, 6 1s, or 6 of another digit I have. Bidding 6 8s seems slightly less risky than challenging, as I have an 8 and Player 1 might have several. Challenging 6 6s is risky because Player 1 has been successful with 6s bids in the past and could potentially have four or more 6s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I have no 8s and only two 6s. Bidding higher on 8s is not possible and bidding higher on 6s would likely result in a challenge I would lose. The only alternative is to bid on a different digit. I could bid 7 of any digit, but that seems risky. I could challenge, but 6 8s might be possible with 16 digits total. I will bid 7 0s as that is the lowest possible bid and I have a 0 in my hand. If the other player challenges, I have a chance of winning.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 56648113. The current bid is 7 0s. I have zero 0s in my hand. Bidding 7 0s or higher on 0s is risky given I have none. I have two 6s, two 1s, one 5, one 4, one 8, and one 3. The previous bid was 6 8s, which I made and Player 1 raised to 7 0s. Player 1 likely has several 0s to make that bid. However, 7 0s is a high bid with only 16 total digits. I have two 6s and two 1s, so bidding on those digits seems more plausible. Bidding 7 1s or 7 6s would be a valid higher bid. Given my two 6s, bidding 7 6s seems reasonable, implying I think there's at least 5 more 6s in Player 1's hand. Alternatively, challenging is an option if I believe 7 0s is too high, but given the previous bids and eliminations, Player 1 might have a significant number of 0s. Bidding 7 6s is a strong move based on my hand and increases the digit from the previous bid of 7 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. With 16 total digits, a bid of 8 6s means Player 1 is claiming there are at least six 6s in their hand. This seems highly improbable. The probability of having 6 or more 6s in 8 random digits is very low. Given the high bid and my limited 6s, challenging seems the most strategic move.
