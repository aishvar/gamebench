Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no previous bids have been made, I can start by bidding a conservative amount based on my hand. My hand contains the digits 0, 2, 2, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0. Counting the digits, I have: 0 appears 4 times, 2 appears 2 times, 5 appears 2 times. The highest count is 4 for digit 0. To be safe and reasonable, I will bid 4 0s, which aligns with my hand and is not overly aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s, which is the average expected count for any digit with 48 total digits among 6 players (48 / 10 = 4.8, rounded to 4). Challenging this bid is risky as it's statistically plausible. My hand contains two 6s and two 7s. Bidding 4 of a higher digit is a valid increase. Bidding 4 6s is a plausible bid based on my hand (I have two 6s, needing two more from the other 5 players, which is reasonable given the average distribution). This is a safer move than challenging the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 5 6s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have enough 6s to make it plausible. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit, but I don't have a strong indication of other players' hands. Increasing the quantity of 6s seems like the safest option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s, which seems plausible given the number of players. I have two 6s in my hand, so I can reasonably increase the quantity and digit. However, I should also consider the total digits remaining and the previous bids. Given that Player 1 bid 4 6s, I should bid a higher quantity to increase my chances of winning.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. My hand contains no 6s, and with 48 total digits across all players, the likelihood of there being at least 6 6s is low, especially given previous bids did not confirm higher counts. Challenging this bid is a strategic move to test its validity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is None and I have 2 6s in my hand. Given the previous round's bid was 6 6s which was challenged and won, I can safely assume that 6 is a popular digit. I'll increase the quantity to 3 and the digit to 7, making a safe and strategic bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. It's early in the round, and I don't have strong evidence to challenge. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity to 4 and keeping the digit as 7, or increasing the digit to 8 and keeping the quantity as 3. I will bid 4 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand contains '50292050', which includes one 7 (at position 3). The total number of 7s across all players is likely low, given my single 7 and the total digits remaining. Bidding 5 7s would be a stretch, but since I have only one 7, it's unlikely that there are 5 sevens in total. Challenging the current bid seems safer, as the count of 7s is probably less than 4, especially with only 40 total digits and 5 players, each with 8 digits. Challenging is the best move to test the bid's validity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made in the current round, I have the opportunity to start the bidding. My hand contains the digits 5, 0, 2, 9, 2, 0, 5, 0, which includes three 0s and two 2s, among others. Starting with a safe bid like '1 0s' is reasonable to establish a baseline without risking an immediate challenge. Bidding higher than '1 0s' is unnecessary at this point, and challenging would be premature without a prior bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s, which is very low for 32 digits. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 2 6s is a safe and valid bid that increases the quantity from the previous bid, making it a stronger move than simply increasing the digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s would be a logical next step, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same. This seems reasonable given my hand and the current game state. I don't want to challenge as it's early in the round and 2 6s is plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s, and I have the digits 5, 0, 2, 9, 2, 0, 5, 0. Counting the 6s in my hand, I have none. Given that four players have already bid up to 4 6s, and I have no 6s, challenging is a good option. The total number of 6s across all hands is unlikely to reach 4, especially since I have zero. Challenging now could reveal that the bid is false, potentially eliminating the previous bidder if they overbid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so any bid is valid. I have 6 in my hand, which is a relatively common digit. I'll bid a moderate quantity to establish a baseline.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s, made by Player 3. My hand contains two 6s and two 7s. With 24 total digits remaining, a bid of 2 6s is quite low and likely true, making a challenge risky. I need to make a higher bid. Bidding 3 6s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity). Since I hold two 6s, I only need one more 6 from the remaining 16 digits held by the other two players for the bid to be true. This is a reasonable probability and a good way to escalate the bidding.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable increase, as it's the next logical quantity. While I don't have more 6s, it's possible the other players do. Challenging seems too risky at this point as 3 6s isn't an outrageous claim.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have 2 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s by Player 2. I can safely assume Player 2 has at least 2 6s and possibly more. Given the total digits remaining is 24, I can confidently bid 5 6s, increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have 2 6s in my hand. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the average count for any digit is 2.4. The bid of 5 is significantly higher than average and requires the other two players (with 16 digits combined) to have at least 3 6s. Based on probability calculations for randomly distributed digits, the chance of the other two players having 3 or more 6s is low (~21% for >= 3 in 16 digits, and even lower, ~3.8%, for Player 3 alone to have >= 3 in 8 digits, which would be needed if Player 2 had 0). This suggests a high probability that the actual count of 6s is less than 5. Challenging this bid appears to have a high chance of success.

Player 2 Reasoning: Player 3 bid 2 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 3 7s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have a 7 to support that bid. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. Considering the limited number of remaining digits (16 total, 8 in each hand), and the recent history of successful bids on 6s, it's risky to challenge. Increasing the quantity of 7s seems like the most logical move.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 5 7s would be risky as it relies on Player 3 having at least two 7s. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid, as the quantity is the same but the digit is higher. I don't have any 8s, so I'm unlikely to win a challenge. Therefore, challenging is not a good option. Bidding 5 8s is also possible but even more risky. I will bid 4 8s.
