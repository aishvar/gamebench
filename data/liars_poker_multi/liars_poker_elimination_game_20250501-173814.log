Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 50994403, which contains two 9s, two 4s, one 0, one 5, and one 3. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and the total number of players. Since there are 6 players and 48 digits in total, bidding on a digit that I see in my hand seems reasonable. I have two 9s, so bidding on 9s with a quantity slightly higher than what I have seems like a good start.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 12 9s. With 48 total digits across all players, the expected number of 9s is around 4.8 (assuming uniform distribution). A bid of 12 9s is highly unlikely, especially since I only have two 9s in my hand. Challenging this bid is reasonable given the low probability of the actual count meeting or exceeding 12.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid that reflects my hand. Bidding 2 9s is a reasonable first move, as it directly corresponds to the count in my hand. However, to be more aggressive and potentially set a higher baseline, I might consider increasing the quantity slightly. Given that there are 5 players, it's plausible that others also have 9s, so bidding 3 9s could be a strategic move to push the game forward.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge Player 1's bid of '3 9s'. Looking at my hand (17659243), I have no 9s. There are 5 players total with 8 digits each, making 40 total digits in play. Player 1 is claiming there are at least 3 nines among all players. Since I have zero 9s in my hand, all 3+ would need to be in the other players' hands. This is certainly possible - the average would be 0.75 nines per player if distributed evenly. Given that I'm missing the average, it's reasonable that others might have more. The bid of 3 9s is quite conservative and likely true, so challenging would be risky. I should make a higher bid instead. I have one 7 in my hand, which gives me some confidence to bid on 7s. I'll bid '4 0s' to increase the quantity while switching to a different digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. I can bid 4 1s, which is a valid higher bid. Since the previous player bid 4, I will bid the minimum amount to stay in the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have three 4s in my hand. With 40 total digits among 5 players, the expected count of any digit is 4. I have a strong holding in 4s. Bidding 5 4s is a valid higher bid (increasing the quantity from 4 to 5) and is well-supported by my hand, as I only need 2 more 4s from the remaining 32 digits held by other players. This is a plausible bid based on my hand and the game state, and is a safer option than challenging the current bid of 4 1s, which is close to the average expectation.

Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '5 4s' and decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge. In my hand, I have no 4s, which means all 5 claimed 4s must be in other players' hands. With 5 players total and 8 digits per player, there are 40 total digits. The probability of finding exactly 5 of a specific digit (4s) among the other 32 digits (40 - my 8) is not extremely low. Given that I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 5, two 6s, and one 8, I could bid on digits I have multiples of (like 6s) or increase the quantity. Since I don't have any 4s, and the current bid isn't unreasonably high, I'll make a higher bid. I'll bid '5 5s' which is higher than '5 4s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity. I have one 5 in my hand, so I'm claiming there are at least 4 more 5s among the other players.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. With 40 total digits, the average count per digit is 4. I have one 5 in my hand, but others might not have enough to reach 5. Challenging this bid is reasonable as it's likely false.

Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. My hand is 17659243, which contains no 9s. Player 1 has bid 2 9s, meaning they believe there are at least 2 nines among all players. Since I have no 9s in my hand, all those 9s must be in other players' hands. With 4 players total and 8 digits per player, there are 32 total digits. It's quite possible that there are at least 2 nines among the other 24 digits I can't see. Player 1's bid seems conservative and likely valid. I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 7, one 6, one 5, one 4, one 3, one 2, and two 1s. I could bid 3 1s since I have two 1s in my hand, which increases the quantity from Player 1's bid. This is a reasonable bid that I can support with my own hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I don't have any 1s in my hand. I can bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. I'll bid 4 2s, as I have a 2 in my hand and increasing the quantity by 1 seems like a safe move.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. My hand contains three 4s. With 32 total digits, the expected number of 4s is 3.2 from the other players' hands, plus the three I hold gives a total expected count of 5.2. Bidding 5 4s is a safe and strong bid that increases the quantity from the previous bid and is very likely to be true.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. My hand contains no 4s, and with 32 total digits remaining, the probability of at least 5 4s across all players is low. Challenging this bid is a reasonable risk given the lack of evidence for its validity.

Player 4 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round, and the current bid is 'None'. My hand contains three 4s and two 7s. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the average expected count for any digit is 2.4. Based on my hand, the expected total count for 4s is approximately 3 (mine) + 1.6 (others) = 4.6, and for 7s is 2 (mine) + 1.6 (others) = 3.6. Bidding 4 4s is a strong opening bid that is likely true based on my hand and the statistical expectation, and it sets a reasonable quantity for the next player.

Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (17659243), I have one 4 in it. Player 4 has bid that there are at least 4 fours among all players. With 24 total digits remaining across 3 players (8 digits each), and me having 1 four, there would need to be at least 3 more fours between the other two players. This is certainly possible, but not guaranteed. I could challenge, but it's risky since the bid is relatively modest. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 5s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 5s. I'll bid '5 5s', increasing the quantity by 1.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have no 5s in my hand. With only 24 total digits, 5 5s seems plausible. I will bid higher to avoid a challenge, increasing the quantity to 6 and choosing a digit I have in my hand, like 6.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s by Player 3. There are 24 total digits remaining. My hand (34247714) contains zero 6s. This means all six 6s, if they exist, must be in the other two players' hands (16 digits total). The expected number of 6s in 16 random digits is 1.6. While Player 3 might have a concentration of 6s, a bid of 6 is significantly higher than the expected value and requires a substantial number of 6s spread between the other two players. Specifically, if Player 3 has 4 sixes (a high number for 8 digits), Player 2 would still need 2 sixes from their 8 digits for the bid to be true (P(>=2 in 8 digits) is about 19%). If Player 3 has 5 sixes, Player 2 needs 1 (P(>=1 in 8 digits) is about 57%). If Player 3 has 6 sixes, Player 2 needs 0 (100%). Given I have zero 6s and the bid is high relative to the total digits, challenging seems less risky than making a higher bid, especially a bid at quantity 7 which would be even less likely to be true.

Player 2 Reasoning: Analyzing my hand (17659243), I have one 4 in it. Player 4 has bid '4 4s', claiming there are at least 4 fours between our hands. Since I have 1 four, that means Player 4 would need to have at least 3 fours in their hand for this bid to be valid. With 8 digits per player, having 3 of the same digit is possible but somewhat unlikely. I could challenge, but it's risky. Alternatively, I could make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, which gives me confidence to bid '4 5s', increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity. This seems like a safer move than challenging or bidding a higher quantity with less certainty.
