Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s, which is a relatively low bid given there are 48 total digits (expected count of any digit is around 4.8). Challenging this bid is risky as it's likely true. My hand is 92045655. I have three 5s. Bidding 3 5s is a valid higher bid (increasing the quantity from 2 to 3) and is strongly supported by the digits in my hand. This is a safe and strategic bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 1. I have the digits 9, 8, 0, 6, 4, 5, 8, 1 in my hand, which includes one 5. Given that there are 6 active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total number of digits is 48. The bid of 3 5s seems plausible but not extremely high. I can increase the quantity or the digit to make a higher bid. Since I have one 5 and several high digits, bidding 4 8s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit based on my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand, which makes bidding on 0s strategic. The current bid of 4 8s is plausible given the average expected count of 4.8 for any digit. Challenging would risk elimination since the bid is likely correct. Bidding 5 0s increases the quantity, leveraging my strong 0s count and maintaining a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. My hand is 21469488, which contains no 0s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits in total. The bid of 5 0s implies that there are at least 5 zeros across all players. I have 0 zeros in my hand, so the 5 zeros must be distributed among the other 5 players. This seems plausible but slightly high. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since my hand doesn't have any 0s, and I don't have information about others, I'll consider increasing the digit to make a higher bid. Bidding 5 1s is a valid higher bid because it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit. However, my hand has two 1s, so it's reasonable to believe there could be at least 5 1s across all hands, considering the distribution. Thus, bidding 5 1s is a reasonable action.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The bid is at '5 1s', meaning Player 4 claims there are at least 5 ones across all players' hands. Looking at my own hand (41653890), I have one '1'. To evaluate if I should challenge or bid higher, I need to estimate the probability of there being at least 4 more ones in the other players' hands. With 5 other players each having 8 digits, that's 40 other digits. It's reasonable that there could be 4 more ones among those 40 digits. If I were to bid higher, I could bid '5 2s', '5 3s', etc., or increase the quantity. Looking at my hand, I have one '3', one '4', one '5', one '6', one '8', one '9', and one '0'. Since I have one '3', I could reasonably bid '5 3s', which would be higher than '5 1s' while still being plausible.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. I could bid 6 0s (higher quantity), 5 4s (same quantity, higher digit), or anything higher than that. Since I only have one 3, I don't want to overcommit to that digit. I'll bid 6 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s made by Player 0. Player 0's bidding history (2 0s, then 5 0s, then 6 0s) suggests they likely hold multiple 0s, making the bid of 6 0s plausible. Challenging seems risky. My hand contains three 5s, which is my most frequent digit. Bidding 6 5s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit than 6 0s). It requires a total of six 5s among all 6 players. Since I have three, the other 5 players need three more 5s from their 40 digits. The expected number of 5s in 40 random digits is 4, so getting at least three is quite probable. This is a safe and strategic bid based on my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s made by Player 1. My hand contains one 8 and no 5s. Given that the bid is 6 5s, I need to assess if it's likely or not. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits in total. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. Since 6 5s seems plausible but not certain, I should consider my options. I can try to bid higher or challenge. My hand has one 8, so bidding 7 8s seems aggressive but possible. However, I should also consider the likelihood of 6 5s being true. Without exact information, I must make an educated guess.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 8s. I hold one 8, so there must be at least six more 8s across 40 remaining digits (5 other players * 8 digits). The expected number of 8s in 40 random digits is ~4 (40/10), making 7 8s statistically unlikely. Player 2's aggressive jump from 4 8s to 7 8s suggests potential bluffing. Challenging this bid carries a high reward if correct.

Player 3 Reasoning: Player 3 has three 0s in their hand. With 5 players (40 total digits), the average count per digit is 4 (40/10 digits). Bidding 4 0s aligns with the statistical average and leverages the player's confidence in their own zeros. Starting with a moderate bid avoids early confrontation while maintaining plausibility.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. My hand is 21469488, which contains no 0s. Given that there are 40 total digits and 4 players before me have bid, it's likely that the count of 0s is not extremely high. However, I need to consider the total count across all 5 players. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand doesn't have any 0s, I'm inclined to believe the count of 0s might be lower, but I should still consider the bids made by others. I'll increase the digit to make a higher bid. Bidding 4 1s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit and keeps the quantity the same.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. My hand contains 41653890, which has one 1 in it. The current bid is 4 1s by Player 4. With 5 active players and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits in play. For there to be at least 4 1s, the other players would need to have at least 3 more 1s among them. This is certainly possible. Looking at my options, I could either raise the bid or challenge. Since I have one 1 myself, the bid of 4 1s seems reasonable and not worth challenging. For my bid, I could go to 4 2s, 4 3s, etc., or increase the quantity to 5 of any digit. I have one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 8, one 9, and one 0 in my hand. Since I have one 3 in my hand, bidding 4 3s seems reasonable as there would need to be 3 more 3s among other players, which is possible. I'll bid 4 3s to continue the game.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. I could bid 4 4s, but that's not much higher. I could also bid 5 of any digit. Since there are 40 total digits remaining, bidding 8 of any digit is extremely unlikely to be true. However, bidding 5 of any digit is also risky without a good count of that digit in my hand. I will bid 5 0s since the previous round had several bids on 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains three 5s, making 5s my strongest digit. The current bid is 5 0s. Bidding 6 5s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity). Based on having three 5s and 40 total digits among 5 players, bidding 6 5s is statistically reasonable (requiring at least three more 5s among the other 32 digits, which is close to the expected 3.2). This leverages my strong hand and puts pressure on the next player. While challenging 5 0s has a decent probability of success (~59.7%), bidding 6 5s appears slightly safer based on the probability of the bid being true (~62.2%) and uses my hand information effectively.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. My hand is 21469488, which contains no 0s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in total. The bid of 7 0s implies that there are at least 7 zeros among the 40 digits. Since I have no 0s, the other 4 players must have at least 7 zeros among them. This seems somewhat plausible but is on the higher side given that the previous bid was 5 0s and then 6 5s. However, it's not extremely unlikely. I should consider bidding higher or challenging. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Increasing the quantity to 8 0s seems too high given the previous bids and the total number of digits. I can bid 7 1s, keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit. My hand has two 1s, so it's possible others have more. Bidding 7 1s is a reasonable move as it is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The bid is 7 1s. In my hand, I have only one 1 (in 41653890). There are 5 active players with 8 digits each, so 40 total digits in play. For there to be 7 or more 1s, the other players would need to have at least 6 more 1s among them. That's possible but somewhat unlikely. Each digit has approximately a 1/10 chance of appearing, so we'd expect about 4 1s total across all hands. However, Player 4 confidently bid 7 1s, which suggests they might have several 1s in their hand. Given that I only have one 1, and the bid is already at 7, which is significantly above the expected average, I think challenging is the better option here rather than making a higher bid that would be even less likely to be true.

Player 5 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding in this round. Looking at my hand (41653890), I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 8, and one 9. Since I have one of each digit, I don't have a strong concentration of any particular digit. Based on previous rounds, 0s and 5s have been bid frequently, suggesting other players might have these digits. I'll start with a conservative bid of 3 5s, which means I'm betting there are at least 3 fives among all players, including the one I have in my hand. This is a reasonable opening bid that leaves room for escalation while not being too aggressive.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains three 5s (92045655). The current bid is 4 5s. To make a valid bid, I must bid strictly higher. Bidding 5 5s is a strong move because I hold three of the required five 5s, meaning only two more are needed from the remaining 24 digits across the other three players. Based on simple probability (expected 2.4 fives in 24 digits), this bid is likely to be true (~70% chance of at least two 5s in 24 digits). Challenging 4 5s would require the total count of 5s to be less than 4. Since I have 3, this would mean there are zero 5s among the other 24 digits, which is very unlikely (probability of no 5s in 24 digits is ~8%). Therefore, bidding 5 5s is the most strategic move.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 6 0s, which means there need to be at least 5 more 0s among the other three players' hands. Each player has 8 digits, so it's certainly possible that there are 6 or more 0s total. However, given that Player 3 jumped from 5s to 0s, they might be bluffing. Looking at my own hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 8, and one 9. I could bid 6 1s, 6 3s, 6 4s, 6 5s, 6 6s, 6 8s, or 6 9s. Since I have one 5, and the previous bids were about 5s (going up to 5 5s), I'll bid 6 5s to stay with the same quantity but increase the digit value.

With three 5s in my hand, I need at least four more 5s from the remaining 24 digits across three other players for the bid to be true. While 7 is a high quantity, this seems a more strategic move based on my hand than challenging the 7 0s bid, where I only have one 0 and cannot be certain of the opponent's holdings.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge Player 3's bid of 8 0s. Looking at my hand (41653890), I have one 0. For Player 3's bid to be valid, there need to be at least 7 more 0s among the other three players' hands. That's an average of 2.33 zeros per remaining player, which is possible but getting high. Player 3 has been bidding aggressively on 0s throughout the game (4 0s, 6 0s, 7 0s, now 8 0s), which suggests they might have several 0s in their hand. However, with only 32 total digits in play and 8 of those in my hand (with just one 0), I need to be cautious. I could bid 8 1s, but that's risky since I only have one 1 in my hand. I could also bid 9 0s, but that would be even riskier given I only have one 0. Given the pattern of bids and my hand composition, I think challenging is the safer option here.

Looking at my hand (41653890), I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 8, and one 9. Based on previous rounds, Player 0 seems confident about 0s (bidding 5 0s, 7 0s, and 8 0s in previous rounds), and Player 1 seems confident about 5s (bidding 6 5s and 7 5s). Since I have one 0 and one 5 in my hand, these could be reasonable starting points. I'll start with a moderate bid of 4 5s since I have one 5 and Player 1 has shown confidence in 5s, suggesting they may have multiple 5s in their hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. To bid higher, I can bid 5 0s, which is a higher quantity than the current bid, or 4 6s, which is a higher digit. Given that the game is down to 3 players (24 total digits), a bid of 5 0s is risky. Bidding 4 6s is safer and still a valid bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains three 5s. The current bid is 4 6s. Bidding 5 5s is a valid higher bid because the quantity (5) is greater than the current bid's quantity (4). With three 5s in my hand, claiming a total of five 5s is a reasonable and relatively safe bid, as it only requires two more 5s from the remaining 16 digits held by the other two players. This leverages my hand strength and is a less risky move than challenging the current bid of 4 6s, which is not obviously a bluff.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. The current bid is 5 5s from Player 1. Looking at my hand (41653890), I have one 5. For there to be at least 5 fives total, Player 0 and Player 1 would need to have at least 4 more 5s between them. With 8 digits per player and 3 players, there are 24 total digits. The probability of having 4 more 5s among the 16 digits I don't see is reasonable. I could bid 5 6s, increasing the digit but keeping the same quantity. I could also bid 6 0s, 6 1s, 6 3s, 6 5s, 6 8s, or 6 9s (increasing the quantity). Looking at my hand, I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 5, one 8, and one 9, so bidding 6 of any of these seems risky. However, I notice I have one 6 in my hand, so bidding 5 6s seems like a reasonable move that's based on my hand knowledge.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. Player 5 has been challenging a lot and winning. Bidding higher seems risky, as I have no information to suggest the bid is wrong. I will challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is a new round and I am Player 0, I get to start the bidding. I have one 5, one 6, two 0s, one 1, one 3, and one 9, and one 7 in my hand. I can start with a reasonable bid. I'll bid 2 0s, since I have two 0s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. My hand is 92045655, which contains three 5s. Bidding 3 5s is a valid higher bid because the quantity (3) is greater than the quantity of the current bid (2). This bid is guaranteed to be true based on my hand alone, making it a safe and strategic move. Challenging the bid of 2 0s is risky, as having two or more 0s in 16 total digits is not improbable, especially since Player 0 chose to bid on 0s.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Since there are 16 total digits, it is plausible that there are at least 3 fives. I don't want to challenge yet. I can bid 4 0s, since I have two 0s in my hand and the bid would be higher than 3 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. My hand contains one 0. With a total of 16 digits between two players, for the bid of 4 0s to be true, Player 0 must hold at least three 0s in their 8 digits. The probability of a player holding 3 or more of a specific digit in 8 digits is low. Given the statistical unlikelihood of this bid being true, challenging is the most strategic move.
