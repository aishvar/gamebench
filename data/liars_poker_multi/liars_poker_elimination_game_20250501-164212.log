Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 35362257, which gives me two 2s, two 3s, two 5s, and one each of 6 and 7. Bidding on a digit I have a decent count of makes sense to start conservatively. I'll bid 3 5s, as I have two 5s myself, and it's likely there are more among the other 40 digits across the remaining players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. My hand contains one 5 and one 6. Bidding 3 6s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Since I hold one 6, it's plausible there are at least two more 6s across other players' hands, making this bid reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 6s in my hand, but there are 6 players with 8 digits each (48 total). While 3 6s is possible, I have two 5s and know the previous bid of '3 5s' was valid. Given I see no 6s and the bid increased to 3 6s, I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Since I have two 7s, I could bid '3 7s', but challenging seems safer since I know there are zero 6s in my 8 digits, meaning Player 1 would need to find 3 6s among the remaining 40 digits. This makes the current bid statistically unlikely enough to warrant a challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: As the first to bid in this round, I need to set a reasonable starting bid. My hand contains two 7s, so bidding 3 7s is plausible, assuming at least one other player has a 7. This follows the pattern of previous rounds where bids started at 3 of a digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 4 0s increases the quantity, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have the digits 0, 3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 4, 4 in my hand, which means I have two 0s. To beat the current bid, I can either increase the quantity or increase the digit. Since I only have 2 zeros, I cannot bid higher than 4 0s. The next logical move is to challenge, as the current bid of 4 0s is quite high given only 2 zeros in my hand and the total of 40 digits. Challenging seems the best move to test the validity of the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid that's higher than the minimum. Bidding 3 0s increases the quantity from my actual count of 2, making it a reasonable and strategic move to pressure others.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s made by Player 3. I have 8 in my hand, which is higher than 0. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 35362257, which contains no 8s. The current bid is 3 8s by Player 5. With 32 total digits across 4 players, it's possible but not highly likely that there are at least 3 8s in the combined hands, especially since I have none. However, challenging carries a risk of elimination if wrong. Instead, I can make a safer bid. I have two 2s in my hand, so bidding 4 2s feels reasonable as it increases the quantity from 3 to 4, even though the digit decreases. This keeps me in the game without taking an immediate risk on a challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have one 2 in my hand (56277843). With 32 total digits across 4 players, the bid requires at least three more 2s among the remaining 24 digits. Considering the probability of exactly three 2s in 24 digits (expected ~2.4) and the risk of a bluff, challenging is a reasonable move. If the bid is false, I win and eliminate Player 0.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 4 7s is reasonable, as it accounts for my two 7s and allows for at least two more in the other players' hands. This bid is conservative enough to be defensible if challenged but still gives room for escalation in the bidding war.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 4 8s increases the digit, which is a valid higher bid than the current 4 7s. This leverages the higher digit rule while maintaining the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. Considering the total digits remaining is 24, bidding 4 9s seems like a reasonable and higher bid, increasing the digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand, and with only 16 digits remaining across the other two players, achieving 4 9s is unlikely. Challenging this high-digit bid with no supporting digits in my hand is a calculated risk to eliminate Player 5 if the bid is false.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: As the first bidder in the final round with two players, I need to make a bid that is both plausible and strategic. My hand contains two 7s, which gives me a moderate base to build on. Bidding 3 7s is reasonable because I already have two, and it's likely the opponent has at least one 7 in their 8-digit hand. This bid balances safety and aggression, setting a baseline that can be challenged or raised. Challenging this bid would require the opponent to risk elimination if the count is indeed 3 or more, which is probable given the distribution of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains one 8. The current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 3 8s increases the digit value while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages the fact that I have at least one 8, and Player 1 might have additional 8s to meet the bid.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:0 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s by Player 3. Bidding 4 8s increases the quantity while maintaining the digit. Since I only have one 8, this forces Player 3 to either challenge (risking their elimination if they don't have three 8s) or make an even higher bid. Challenging the current bid would require assuming Player 3 has fewer than two 8s, which is less certain given the unknown distribution. Bidding 4 8s is a calculated risk to escalate the pressure.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand contains one 8, and Player 1's hand (unknown) would need at least three 8s to meet the bid. Given the limited total digits (16) and the high probability that Player 1 doesn't have three 8s, challenging the bid is a reasonable risk. If the actual count of 8s is less than 4, I win; otherwise, Player 1 wins. Since the bid is high and my hand provides no additional 8s, challenging is the strategic choice.
