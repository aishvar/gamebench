Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the bidding and there are no previous bids to base my decision on, I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 60685346, I notice I have two 6s. Since the goal is to make a bid that is reasonable and has a chance of being correct, bidding on a digit I have in my hand seems like a good strategy. With 6 players and 8 digits each, the maximum number of any digit could be 48 if all players had the same digit in all their slots, which is highly unlikely. However, since I have two 6s, bidding on at least 2 6s seems like a safe and reasonable start, considering the total number of digits and the fact that I'm starting the bidding.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, bidding 2 7s or higher would also be valid as it increases the digit. Given my hand (95229904), I have no 7s but I could bid on a digit that appears multiple times in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 30860691, which contains three 6s. The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 1. Since I have three 6s, I know that the total count of 6s is at least three. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. I will increase the digit to make a higher bid. Thus, bidding 3 7s is a valid and reasonable next step.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 4 7s seems reasonable because there is a good chance that at least one other player has a 7. This bid increases the digit while maintaining the quantity. Challenging seems risky because it's possible that at least one other player has a 7.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. Bidding 5 4s leverages my own digits and increases the quantity, which is a logical step given the potential distribution. Since the expected count for 7s is slightly above 4, challenging would be risky. Raising to 5 4s uses my strong 4s and follows the bid hierarchy.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. In my hand (2,4,6,5,6,1,9,8), I have only one 4. Statistically, with 48 digits and 6 players, the expected number of any digit is about 4.8, so 5 is a reasonable but slightly aggressive bid. Since I have only one 4, it's risky to challenge now, as it's plausible there are 5 4s among all hands. To stay in the game, I'll make a higher bid using a digit I hold multiple times. I have two 6s, so I'll bid 5 6s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. The current bid is 5 6s, which seems plausible given the history of bids. Since I need to make a strictly higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Given that the highest digit bid so far has been a 7 and considering the distribution of my hand, bidding on a higher digit might be risky without more information. Increasing the quantity of 6s to 6 would be a safe move, considering my own hand contributes three 6s to the total, and there's a history of 6s being bid upon.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s made by Player 0. I have two 6s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the bid is already at 6 6s, I should consider bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit. I will bid 7 6s as it seems reasonable given my hand and the current bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have the hand 30860691, which contains three 6s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have three 6s, it's likely that the total count of 6s across all players is at least 7 or more, but I'm not certain. However, bidding 8 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, bidding 7 7s is also an option. Given that I have one 7 in my hand and previous bids have been made on 7s, it's plausible that there's a significant number of 7s. I'll choose to bid 7 7s as it is a higher bid than 7 6s and seems relatively plausible given the game history.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. I have one 7 in my hand and there are 48 digits remaining. Since the previous player bid 7 7s, there could be 7 7s in the other players' hands. However, bidding 8 7s is risky, but challenging 7 7s is also risky, as it is plausible. I have two 6s in my hand, and since there have been multiple bids on 6s, it is likely that there are at least 8 6s among all players. I will bid 8 6s, increasing the digit and quantity slightly.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid of 8 6s requires at least 8 sixes across all 48 digits. I have only one 6 in my hand, leaving 7 remaining to be distributed among the other 40 digits. Statistically, the expected number of sixes in 40 digits is 4, making it unlikely that the total reaches 8. Given the improbability and the risk of elimination, challenging is the optimal move.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None' because it's the start of a new round. I have two 8s in my hand. Since no one has bid yet, I can start with a conservative bid that's higher than the minimum requirement. Bidding 2 8s is a safe start, as it's unlikely that someone has a high count of 8s given the game history.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 24656198, which contains one 8. The current bid is 2 8s, which is plausible given my own hand and the total of 40 digits in play. It is likely that at least one other player has an 8, so challenging now would be risky. The minimum valid higher bid is 2 9s, which is also supported by my hand (I have one 9). Making a small, safe increment keeps my options open and doesn't overcommit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 2 9s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have no 9s in my hand (60685346) and considering the total digits remaining (40), bidding on a higher digit than 9 is not possible. Therefore, I must increase the quantity. Given that I have multiple 6s and the game history shows a strong presence of 6s, I could bid on 6s, but I need to exceed the current quantity of 2 for a digit higher than 9, which is not possible. Thus, my best option is to increase the quantity for the digit 9 or bid on a digit that could reasonably exceed the current bid's quantity. However, since the current bid is on 9s and increasing the quantity for 9s directly might be risky without having any 9s in my hand, I should consider the likelihood of 9s being present in other players' hands. Given the history, players have bid high on 6s and 7s, and there's been a bid on 8s and now 9s. Without direct evidence of many 9s, challenging seems like a viable option, especially since the total number of digits is 40, and having exactly 2 or more 9s might not be highly probable across all players. However, my hand does not provide direct insight into the presence of 9s among other players. Considering the strategic aspect, challenging might put pressure on the bidder if they're bluffing, but it also risks my position if the bid is correct. Given these considerations and the fact that I don't have a clear advantage in bidding higher due to the lack of 9s in my hand and the need to strictly increase the bid, I lean towards challenging the current bid as it seems risky to bid higher without concrete evidence or a strong hand to support such a bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: It's the start of a new round with 4 players and 32 total digits. I have the hand 24656198, which contains the following digit counts: 2 (1), 4 (1), 6 (2), 5 (1), 1 (1), 9 (1), 8 (1). My previous bid of 2 9s was underestimated by opponents, as the actual count was 5. As the first bidder, I want to start with a safe and credible bid based on my hand. I have 2 sixes, which is my most frequent digit. It's reasonable to open with '2 6s', both as a solid bid and as a potential to build future bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s made by Player 5. I have two 6s in my hand. Given that there are 4 active players and each has 8 secret digits, there are a total of 32 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. Since my hand contains two 6s, and assuming the other players might have some 6s as well, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. However, without exact information on other players' hands, I should consider the likelihood of the current bid being true or false. Given that I have 2 sixes and there are 3 other players, it's possible that the total count of 6s could be higher than 2. I will bid higher than 2 6s. Bidding 3 6s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have the hand 30860691, which contains three 6s. This means I can confirm that at least 3 sixes exist in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have three 6s, it's likely that the total count of 6s across all players is at least 3 6s. I will increase the digit to make a higher bid. Bidding 3 7s is a valid move as it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit. However, I should analyze my hand further. My hand contains one 7 and one 8 and one 9 and three 6s and one 0 and one 1. So, I have one 7. Considering the total count of 7s across all players, with 32 digits remaining, it's plausible that there are more 7s. Thus, bidding 3 7s or increasing the quantity slightly is reasonable. I will choose to bid 4 6s as it increases the quantity and is still a relatively safe bid given the current state.

However, bidding 5 6s would be risky as it's only one more than the current bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: Since it's my turn to start bidding and I have the hand '30860691', I can see I have two 6s and no 9s or 8s but have other digits. With 24 total digits remaining across all players, a reasonable starting bid could be related to the count of a digit I see in my hand or a relatively common digit. I see two 6s and one 0, so bidding on 6s or 0s could be a good start. Given that I have to make a bid and there's no previous bid to compare to, I'll start with a bid that seems reasonable based on my hand and the total number of digits. Bidding '6 0s' seems too high since I only see one 0. However, bidding '3 6s' seems plausible as it is a modest increase considering the total count.

The probability that there are at least three 6s is high, given that I already hold two. It is risky to challenge, as the bid is very plausible. The minimum valid raise is either 3 7s or 4 6s. I do not have any 7s, but raising to 4 6s is reasonable because I have two and it's likely there is at least one more among the other players. Therefore, I will bid 4 6s.

Given that there are only 24 total digits remaining across all players and we are down to 3 players, each with 8 digits, I need to assess if bidding higher is reasonable or if challenging is more strategic. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. Since 4 6s is already bid and I have two 6s, bidding 5 6s seems aggressive but possible if others have enough 6s. However, given that we are nearing the end and digits are limited, challenging seems like a viable option if the bid seems unlikely. I will calculate the likelihood of 4 6s being valid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 1. I have the hand 30860691, which contains three 6s. Given that there are 24 total digits and I have 8 of them, there are 16 digits left with the other two players. It's possible they have 2 or more 6s between them, making the total count 5 or more. However, bidding higher seems challenging. I can either bid 5 7s or 6 0s/1s/2s/3s/4s/5s. Since my hand has a good distribution of digits and I have some confidence in the count of certain digits, I can consider bidding 5 7s as it is a relatively safer bid compared to challenging. However, given the history of the game and the fact that the previous player bid 5 6s, challenging seems like a viable option if I think the bid is too high. Upon closer inspection, my hand has one 7, and there are 16 other digits. It's plausible that there's at least one more 7 among them, making a total of 2 or more 7s. Bidding 5 7s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

The probability that Player 1 has at least one 6 in their 8 digits is not negligible, but if they had two or more 6s they likely would have made a higher bid earlier. Given the history of aggressive bidding on 6s and the fact that I know where most of them are, it's plausible Player 1 is bluffing. Therefore, I will challenge.
