Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 57524431, which gives me two 5s, two 4s, and one each of 7, 2, 3, and 1. Bidding on 5s seems reasonable as I have two of them, and with 48 total digits across all players, it's plausible that there are at least a couple more 5s out there. I'll bid 3 5s to start conservatively, balancing risk and believability.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s, made by Player 0. I have two 4s in my hand. A bid of 4 4s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity). This bid requires a total of four 4s among all 6 players. Since I have two, only two more are needed from the other 5 players (40 digits). This is a reasonable and well-supported bid based on my hand and the number of digits remaining.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. There are 48 total digits among 6 players. Statistically, each digit should appear about 4.8 times (48/10). A bid of 4 4s is therefore quite plausible and likely too low to challenge this early. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 04033126. I have two 0s and two 3s, which are my strongest digits. Bidding based on these seems safest. Possible higher bids are 4 5s+ or 5 of any digit. Bidding 5 0s is a valid higher bid (increasing quantity). It requires three more 0s among the other 40 digits held by the other 5 players. Given I have two 0s, this bid is reasonably supported by my hand and statistically plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 0s. Since there are 48 total digits and 40 remaining in other players' hands, it's plausible there are two more 0s to meet the bid. However, increasing the quantity to 6 0s raises the required total to six 0s (I have three, needing three more in 40 digits). Bidding 6 0s is a valid higher bid and shifts the burden to the next player to either challenge or raise further, leveraging my existing 0s while maintaining strategic pressure.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, leaving 40 unknown digits. With p=0.1, the expected zeros among unknown is 4 and the probability of at least 5 zeros (to meet the bid of 6 total) is only about 40%, so thereâ€™s roughly a 60% chance the bid is false. Since challenging has >50% chance to win, I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains three 0s and two 8s. Bidding 4 0s is a conservative estimate since I already have three, and there are 32 remaining digits across other players. This bid is likely safe given the average distribution of digits and my current holdings.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 3's bid of 4 0s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (76205112), I have only one 0. Since there are 5 active players with 8 digits each (40 total digits), and Player 3 claims there are at least 4 zeros total, I need to assess if this is reasonable. In the previous round, there were actually 7 zeros among 6 players (48 digits). Now with 5 players, it's very plausible that there are at least 4 zeros. Since I have 1 zero myself, Player 3 only needs 3 more zeros among the other 3 players, which is quite reasonable. I'll make a higher bid rather than challenge. I could bid 5 0s, but I only have 1 zero myself, so I'd prefer to switch digits. I have two 1s in my hand, making '4 1s' a reasonable bid that maintains the same quantity but increases the digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 57524431, which contains only one 1. The current bid is 4 1s by Player 5. With 40 total digits across 5 players, it's possible that there are at least 4 ones in play, especially since I have one myself. However, I need to make a higher bid. I have two 5s in my hand, which is a decent starting point. Bidding 5 2s seems like a reasonable escalation, as it increases the quantity and changes the digit. I don't think challenging is the best move right now since 4 1s is plausible with 40 digits in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. My hand contains zero 2s, making challenging a consideration. However, 5 2s is only slightly above the average expected count (40 total digits / 10 digits = 4 per digit), so challenging carries significant risk. My hand contains two 4s. Bidding 5 4s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is well supported by my hand, requiring only 3 more 4s from the remaining 32 digits. Making a reasonable bid based on my hand is strategically preferable to a risky challenge at this stage.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players, so the expected average count for any digit is 4. The bid of 5 is only slightly above average. I hold one 4, meaning four more 4s are needed across the other 32 digits for the bid to be true. Challenging is plausible but not overwhelmingly strong. I should consider making a higher bid based on my hand (04033126). I have two 0s and two 3s, which are my strongest holdings. Possible higher bids are 5 5s+ or 6 0s+. Bidding 6 0s is an option since I have two 0s, but 0s were heavily bid last round and Player 3 bid 4 0s this round. Bidding 6 3s leverages my two 3s, a digit not yet bid on this round. This seems like a strong, justifiable bid based on my hand, requiring 4 more 3s among the remaining 32 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have no 3s in my hand, and the current bid is 6 3s. The total number of digits remaining is 40, and with 5 players, the maximum possible 3s is 40. However, since I have none, the actual count depends on the other 4 players' hands (32 digits). Assuming an average distribution, it's unlikely they have 6 3s. Challenging this bid is a calculated risk based on my lack of 3s and the improbability of the required count.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand. Considering the previous successful bid of 6 0s and the likelihood that other players also hold 0s, bidding 6 0s is a reasonable starting point. This bid leverages my own holdings and the historical context of 0s being prevalent in the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '6 0s' made by Player 3. Looking at my hand (76205112), I have zero 0s. With 32 total digits and 4 active players, each with 8 digits, I need to estimate if there are at least 6 zeros among all players. In the previous round, Player 3 bid '4 0s' which suggests they might have some zeros. However, from the previous round, we learned there were 7 zeros when Player 4 challenged a '6 0s' bid. Now with Player 4 eliminated, we lost some of those zeros. Given I have none, and there are only 24 digits among the other three players, having 6 or more zeros seems possible but not certain. I could make a higher bid like '6 1s' (I have two 1s in my hand) or '7 0s', but I think challenging is safer given my lack of zeros and the relatively high quantity being claimed.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding in this round with 3 active players (including myself). Each player has 8 digits, so there are 24 total digits. Looking at my hand (76205112), I have: two 1s, two 0s, one 2, one 5, one 6, and one 7. Since I have two 1s in my hand, I know there are at least 2 ones total. A conservative opening bid would be 3 1s, suggesting there's at least one more 1 among the other 16 digits held by other players, which is reasonable. This is a safe starting bid that's not too aggressive but establishes a baseline.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 57524431, which contains one 1. The current bid by Player 5 is 3 1s, meaning they are claiming there are at least three 1s across all 24 digits in play. Since I only have one 1, the other two players must collectively have at least two 1s for the bid to hold. Given that there are only 24 total digits, and without specific knowledge of others' hands, a bid of 3 1s seems plausible but not overly aggressive. I could challenge, but the risk is high as it's early in the round, and the bid isn't excessively high. Instead, Iâ€™ll make a higher bid. My hand has two 5s, so bidding on 5s might be a safe choice. Iâ€™ll bid 4 5s, increasing both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 3 1s, which is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s made by Player 0. My hand contains two 9s. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is supported by the two 9s in my hand, making it a plausible claim. Challenging the previous bid of 4 5s is risky as Player 0 may have multiple 5s, given their previous bids on 5s in this and prior rounds. Bidding 4 9s puts pressure on the next player while being a reasonable claim based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. My hand is 76205112, which contains zero 9s. The current bid is 4 9s from Player 1. With 3 players having 8 digits each (24 total digits), the maximum possible 9s is 24. Since I have zero 9s in my hand, there would need to be at least 4 9s between Player 0 and Player 1's hands. This is possible but not guaranteed. Looking at previous rounds, Player 1 has made reasonable bids, so they might have some 9s. I could bid 5 0s since I have one 0 in my hand, or 5 1s since I have two 1s, but I need to be cautious. Given that 9s is already a high digit and I have none, I think challenging is the safer option here. If Player 1 is bluffing with 4 9s, I'll win the challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I'm starting this final round against Player 0. Looking at my hand (76205112), I have two 1s, two 0s, one 2, one 5, one 6, and one 7. Since I'm making the first bid of the round, I should start with something conservative but strategic. The digits I have the most of are 1s and 0s (two each). I could bid on either, but I'll choose 1s since they appear twice in my hand. A safe initial bid would be 3 1s, suggesting there's at least one more 1 in Player 0's hand, which is reasonably likely in 8 random digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 57524431, which contains two 5s, one 7, one 4, one 2, one 3, and one 1. The current bid by Player 5 is 3 1s. Since there are only 16 total digits in play (8 mine, 8 theirs), and I have one 1, the opponent could have up to 7 1s, making the total possible count of 1s up to 8. A bid of 3 1s is therefore quite plausible and not worth challenging. Instead, I will make a higher bid. Given that I have two 5s, bidding 4 5s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 3 1s. I believe this bid has a decent chance of being valid or at least not immediately challenged, as the opponent cannot know my exact hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. I have the hand 76205112, which contains zero 5s. The current bid is 4 5s made by Player 0. Since there are only 16 total digits in the game (8 from me and 8 from Player 0), and I know I have zero 5s, that means Player 0 would need to have at least 4 5s in their hand for their bid to be valid. While this is possible, it seems somewhat unlikely that they would have exactly the digit they're bidding on in such high quantity. The probability of having 4 or more of the same digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively low. I could make a higher bid like 4 6s or 5 0s, but given my knowledge that there are zero 5s in my hand, challenging seems like the better option.
