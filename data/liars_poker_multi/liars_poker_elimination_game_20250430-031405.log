Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which seems reasonable given the total 48 digits. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or the digit. Since increasing the digit at the same quantity is allowed, I will bid 3 7s, which is a valid higher bid and plausible given the total digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to either make a higher bid than '3 7s' or challenge it. Looking at my hand (93982531), I have one 7 in it. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each (48 total digits), and I know I have one 7, there could be more 7s in other players' hands. The bid of '3 7s' means there are at least 3 sevens among all players, which is quite reasonable given I already have one. I could safely bid '3 8s' (same quantity but higher digit) since I have one 8 in my hand. I could also bid '3 9s' which would be even stronger since I have two 9s in my hand. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to '4 0s', but I don't have any 0s in my hand, making this riskier. I'll go with '3 9s' as it's a safe increase and leverages my hand strength.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 73567096, which contains no 9s. The current bid is 3 9s by Player 2. Since I have none, it’s possible but not guaranteed that the total count of 9s across all players is at least 3. However, with 48 total digits, the average per digit is about 4.8, so 3 of any digit is plausible. I’ll make a higher bid instead of challenging. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 4 7s feels reasonable as it increases the quantity from 3 to 4 and stays on a digit I have some confidence in.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have two 6s, one 7, and one 8 in my hand. The average count for any digit across 6 players (48 total digits) is 4.8. The current bid of 4 7s is plausible, especially since Player 1 also bid on 7s earlier. Challenging 4 7s is risky as 4 is close to the average expectation and I hold one 7, meaning only 3 more are needed from the other 5 players. Bidding higher seems safer and strategic. Based on my hand, bidding on 6s is well supported as I have two of them. Bidding 5 6s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and is strongly supported by my hand (I have 2, needing 3 more from 5 players, which is below the average expectation per player).

Player 5 Reasoning: I hold two 8s while having no 6s. The current bid of 5 6s is close to the expected average, so challenging is risky. By raising the digit to 8 while keeping the quantity at 5, I make a higher bid that is well-supported by my hand: I only need at least three more 8s among the remaining 40 hidden digits, which is quite likely (expected ≈4).

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. To make a valid bid, I need to bid higher. I can bid 6 0s, which is higher than 5 8s. It is a relatively safe bid, as many players might not have 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s, which means at least six 0s exist among all players. I have no 0s in my hand (digits: 6,7,4,8,3,3,5,9). Given that there are 48 digits total, having six 0s is plausible. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 6 but increase the digit. The next valid bid after 6 0s would be 6 1s. Since I have one 5 and one 9, but no 1s, bidding 6 1s is a reasonable increment. Challenging now would be risky because 6 0s is not an extreme bid. Therefore, I will bid 6 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher than '6 1s' or challenge it. Looking at my hand (93982531), I have one 1 digit. For the bid of '6 1s' to be valid, there need to be at least 5 more 1s among the other 5 players' hands. With 8 digits per player and 6 players, there are 48 total digits in play. If digits were evenly distributed, we'd expect about 4-5 of each digit (48÷10=4.8). So '6 1s' is right around the expected value and certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's not a particularly suspicious bid. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 9s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 9s. I'll bid '6 2s' to move to the next digit while keeping the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 73567096, which contains no 2s. The current bid is 6 2s by Player 2. With 48 total digits across 6 players, an average of 4.8 digits of any number is expected. A bid of 6 2s is slightly above average but plausible. However, since I have zero 2s in my hand, the likelihood of there being 6 or more 2s in the remaining 40 digits seems lower. I could challenge, but it's still early in the game, and the bid isn't outrageously high. Instead, I'll make a higher bid of 6 3s, as I have one 3 in my hand, which gives me some confidence in the digit, and it follows the rule of increasing either quantity or digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. My hand contains zero 3s, making the bid of 6 slightly above the average expectation (4.8 total, 4 among other players). However, the bids in this round have steadily increased to a quantity of 6. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 6 6s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is well-supported by my hand, as I only need 4 more 6s from the remaining 40 digits, which is exactly the average expectation (40/10 = 4). This is a strong, non-bluff bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I hold zero 6s. For Player 4’s bid of 6 6s to be true, all six 6s would have to be in the 40 digits the other five players possess. With each digit appearing about 10% of the time, those 40 digits should contain roughly 4 sixes on average; the chance of there being 6 or more is only about 20%. Challenging now gives me roughly an 80% likelihood of knocking out Player 4, while any higher bid would expose me to unnecessary risk. Therefore I should challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this new round, and the current bid is 'None'. My hand contains two 6s. There are 5 players with 8 digits each, totaling 40 digits. The average count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. Bidding '4 6s' is a reasonable opening bid, aligning with the statistical average and based on having two of that digit in my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, which is a valid higher bid. However, since the previous round had a bid of 6 6s that was successful, and I only have two 6s, I am hesitant to bid higher on 6s. Bidding 5 0s is a safe option that doesn't rely on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. My hand is 93982531, which contains one '1'. The current bid is '5 1s', meaning Player 1 believes there are at least 5 ones across all players' hands. With 5 active players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. I have 1 one in my hand, so there would need to be at least 4 more ones among the other 32 digits. This is certainly possible, as the expected number of ones would be around 3-4 in those 32 digits. I could challenge, but it's too risky as the bid is quite reasonable. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, one 8, one 5, one 3, one 2, and one 1. I could bid '5 2s' (increasing the digit) or '6 1s' (increasing the quantity). Since I only have one 1 in my hand, I'll go with '5 2s' as I have one 2 in my hand and it's a safer bid than increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 73567096, which contains no 2s. The current bid is 5 2s by Player 2. With 40 total digits across 5 players, a bid of 5 2s means that on average, each player would need to have 1 of that digit. Since I have none, the other 4 players would need to average 1.25 twos each for the bid to hold. This seems plausible but not overly likely. However, challenging at this level feels risky as 5 is a relatively low quantity for 40 digits. Instead, I’ll make a safer bid by increasing the quantity or digit. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 5 7s feels reasonable as it’s a higher digit than 2 and aligns with my own hand strength.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. My hand contains two 6s and one 7. While 5 7s is a plausible bid (I have one 7, needing 4 more from 32 digits), bidding 6 6s is a stronger move for me as I hold two 6s. This means I only need 4 more 6s from the remaining 32 digits for the bid to be true. This leverages my hand advantage and escalates the quantity, putting pressure on other players. Given my hand, 6 6s is the most confident bid I can make at quantity 6.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. I could bid 7 0s to increase the quantity, or 6 7s to increase the digit. Given the history, bidding 7 0s seems less risky than bidding 6 7s because the previous bid was 6 6s, and I have two 6s. It's possible there are more 6s out there. I'll play it safe and increase the quantity with a 0.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s, which is quite high for the digit 0. I have one 7 and one 3 in my hand but no 0s. The previous bids have incrementally increased the quantity or digit, and 7 0s is already a large quantity for a single digit out of 40 total digits. To make a valid higher bid, I need to bid at least 7 1s or 8 of any digit. I do have one 7, and bidding 7 1s is a minimal increment, but I have no 1s in my hand. Bidding 7 1s or higher quantity with another digit seems risky. Challenging now might be premature since 7 0s is plausible, but bidding 7 1s is the next valid step and a reasonable risk given the game state.

Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. Looking at my hand (93982531), I have one 1 in it. The current bid is 7 1s. With 5 players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits in play. For there to be 7 or more 1s, the other players would need to have at least 6 more 1s among them (since I have 1). That's certainly possible - if each digit appears with roughly equal frequency, we'd expect about 4 of each digit (40 total digits ÷ 10 possible digits). Given that I only have one 1, it's slightly less likely that there are 7 total, but still quite possible. I could challenge, but it seems risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s and two 3s, which gives me more confidence. I'll bid 7 2s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 2s made by Player 2. In my hand, I have one 2, which means I contribute minimally to the total count of 2s. With 40 total digits across 5 players, an average of 4 of each digit would be expected if distributed evenly. A bid of 7 2s is above this average but not excessively so, making it plausible. However, since bids have been increasing steadily and I have no strong indication that there are many 2s in other hands, I will push the bid slightly higher to test the waters. I’ll bid 7 3s, as I have two 3s in my hand, which gives me some confidence in a higher digit bid at the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 3s. There are 5 players remaining, each with 8 digits, totaling 40 digits. The expected number of any specific digit is 40 / 10 = 4. A bid of 7 is significantly above this average. My hand contains zero 3s. This means that for the bid to be true, the other 4 players (holding a total of 32 digits) must have at least seven 3s among them. The expected number of 3s among the other 32 digits is 32 * 0.1 = 3.2. Requiring 7 or more 3s from the remaining digits is statistically unlikely (more than 2 standard deviations above the mean). Given the low probability and my lack of any 3s, challenging the bid is the most strategic move.

Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (93982531), I don't have any 0s. The current bid is 6 0s, which means Player 1 believes there are at least 6 zeros among all 32 digits. With 4 players having 8 digits each, this is certainly possible. However, since I have zero 0s in my hand, all 6 would need to come from the other three players (averaging 2 zeros per player). This seems somewhat high but not implausible. I could challenge, but it's risky. Alternatively, I can make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 8, and two 9s. I could bid 6 1s, 6 2s, or 6 3s, but these would be risky since I only have one of each. A safer option would be to bid 6 5s, 6 8s, or 6 9s. Given that I have two 9s, bidding 6 9s seems most reasonable as I'm contributing 2 toward the total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand. With 4 players remaining (32 total digits), there are 24 unknown digits among the other players. The expected number of 9s among these 24 digits is 24 * 0.1 = 2.4. A bid of 6 9s is significantly higher than this expectation. The probability of having 6 or more 9s in 24 random digits is low (approximately 5.7%). Making a higher bid (which would have to be 7 of any digit) would require a high count of that digit (at least 6 more among others if I have one, or 7 if I have zero), which is also unlikely. Given the low probability of the current bid being true and the risk of making a higher bid, challenging is the most strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I am starting the round with 24 total digits. My hand is 68760514, containing two 6s. With 3 players, the average count for any digit is 2.4. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable opening bid that leverages my hand strength (having two 6s) and is plausible given the total number of digits, although slightly above the statistical average. This is consistent with my opening strategy in previous rounds.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. I can confidently bid 5 6s, as I only need three more 6s between the other two players. Bidding higher than necessary might make them challenge and eliminate each other.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Given there are 24 digits total, 5 sixes is plausible. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. I don't have many sixes, but I have one 7 and one 9 which are higher digits. Bidding 5 7s is a valid increment and still reasonable given my hand and the total digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s by Player 1. There are 3 active players and 24 total digits remaining. My hand contains one 7. For the bid of 5 7s to be true, there must be at least 5 - 1 = 4 sevens among the remaining 16 digits held by Player 0 and Player 1. With an average of 2.4 digits of any type expected in 24 total digits (or 1.6 in 16 digits), requiring 4 of a specific digit in 16 seems statistically unlikely. Based on the high bid relative to the number of digits and my hand, challenging is the most probable winning move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With only 16 total digits remaining (8 in my hand, 8 in Player 0's hand), bidding '3 6s' requires Player 0 to have at least one 6. This is a reasonable expectation (probability around 57%) and provides a solid starting bid based on my strongest digit without being overly aggressive given the low total digit count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. I could bid 4 6s, but that might be too risky. I could also bid 4 of any other digit. Bidding 4 0s seems like a safe option, given that I have two 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s by Player 0. My hand is 68760514, which contains two 6s and one 0. Bidding 4 6s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires a total of four 6s across both hands. Since I have two 6s, Player 0 would need to have two 6s in their hand for the bid to be met. This is a reasonably likely scenario. Challenging the 4 0s bid is also an option, but Player 0 likely has several 0s to have made that bid, making a challenge potentially risky. Bidding 4 6s leverages the strength of my hand (the two 6s) and makes a plausible claim.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s. Bidding 5 0s is a valid bid and increases the quantity. However, I think it's more likely that there are fewer than five 6s in total, since Player 4 has bid on 6s twice already. I can either bid higher or challenge. I will challenge because I think it is unlikely there are 4 6s in total.
