Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. With 48 total digits, the expected count of each digit is about 4.8. Starting with a modest bid of 3 2s is safe based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have no 2s in my hand.  A bid of 3 2s means Player 0 believes there are at least three 2s among the 48 total digits. With 6 players and 8 digits each, the average count for any digit is 48/10 = 4.8.  A bid of 3 2s is below average and seems plausible.  I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 4 3s is a reasonable increase based on my hand and the overall probability.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 4 3s. Bidding 4 5s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, leveraging my existing 5s and making it plausible others have additional 5s. The expected total for 5s is ~4.8, so 4 5s is reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (98164965), I have one 5. The current bid is 4 5s made by Player 2. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For there to be at least 4 5s, the other players need to have at least 3 more 5s among them. This is quite reasonable - if the distribution is roughly uniform, we'd expect about 4.8 fives total (48 digits ÷ 10 possible values). Since I already have 1 five, and only need 3 more among the other 5 players, this bid seems likely to be valid. I could challenge, but it's too risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding on 6s gives me some confidence. I'll bid 4 6s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 3. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. I have the digits 7, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 4, 3 in my hand. I can see that bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit is possible. Since I have two 2s and the bid is on 6s, I can bid on 2s to increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit if I have it. My hand contains a 7, which is higher than 6. I can bid 5 2s, increasing the quantity, or 4 7s, increasing the digit. Bidding 4 7s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit and I have one 7 in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:3 - google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits. The expected average number of any digit is 4.8. The bid of 4 7s is plausible, slightly below average. I have zero 7s in my hand (33599198). Challenging seems risky as 4 is close to the average. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 4 8s, 4 9s, or increasing the quantity to 5 (e.g., 5 0s). I have one 8, making 4 8s a possibility. However, I have three 9s, which strongly supports a bid of 4 9s. Bidding 4 9s follows the current pattern of increasing the digit while keeping the quantity at 4, is statistically reasonable, and leverages my strong hand in 9s. Jumping to 5 seems unnecessarily risky at this stage.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s and I only have one 9, so challenging would win only if there are fewer than three more 9s among 40 unknown cards (≈19% chance). Instead, I should raise to 5 of a digit I hold twice. I have two 2s, so needing three more among the 40 unknown cards has ≈81% chance. Thus I bid 5 2s.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:1 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 36774539. I have two 3s, two 7s, one 6, one 4, one 5, and one 9. The current bid is 5 2s.  I have no 2s.  The average expected count for any digit with 48 total digits across 6 players is 48 / 10 = 4.8.  A bid of 5 2s is slightly above average. Given I have no 2s, and the bid has already escalated through several players, challenging seems reasonable as I have no information supporting the bid. Bidding higher on a digit I have more of (like 3s or 7s) would require a higher quantity, which feels risky without knowing more.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: With 40 total digits, the expected count per digit is about 4. I hold two 2s in my hand, so bidding 4 2s is reasonable as I expect at least two more among the other 32 unknown digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have one 2 in my hand, so there need to be at least three more in the remaining 32 digits of other players. Given the previous round's 5 2s bid was correct, it's plausible there are still enough 2s. Bidding 5 2s increases the quantity slightly while leveraging the known presence of 2s from prior rounds. Challenging risks elimination if the bid is valid, and the expected count of 2s is around 4 (40 digits), making the bid likely correct.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (98164965), I have zero 2s. Player 2 has bid 5 2s, which means they believe there are at least 5 twos among all players. We know Player 0 previously bid 4 2s, suggesting they might have some 2s in their hand. Since I have none, there would need to be 5 twos distributed among the other 4 players. With 8 digits per player and 5 active players, that's 40 total digits. 5 twos out of 40 digits is 12.5%, which is slightly higher than the expected 10% for a random distribution, but still reasonable. I don't have strong evidence to challenge. I should make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 6s. I'll bid 5 6s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 3. I have 2 sixes in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are 40 digits in total. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. I should consider the likelihood of there being at least 5 6s. Since I only have 2 sixes, I need to consider if other players are likely to have enough 6s to make this bid true. A bid of 6 6s would be higher and seems plausible if other players have a few 6s, but I don't want to overbid. I will challenge the current bid because it seems unlikely but not impossible that there are 5 6s in total, and I don't have enough information to confidently make a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my turn as Player 4. I have the hand 71022143, which contains two 1s, two 2s, one 4, one 7, and one 3. Since I need to make a bid that is valid and higher than 'None', I can start with any quantity and digit. I see that I have two 2s, so bidding 2 2s seems like a reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is '2 2s', which is very low for 32 total digits (4 players * 8 digits). The expected count for any digit is 3.2 (32/10). Challenging '2 2s' is extremely risky, as it's highly probable there are at least two 2s across all hands, even though I have none. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 33599198, containing two 3s and three 9s. Bidding '3 9s' is a valid higher bid. Since I hold three 9s myself, this bid is truthful based solely on my hand, making it a safe and strong play. It increases the quantity and utilizes my most frequent digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand and expect about 2.4 more among the 24 unknown cards, making a total around 4.4. Bidding 4 2s is a plausible raise over 3 9s while using digits I hold. Challenging 3 9s is too risky (~30% win chance).

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 4 2s, which may be plausible given the average distribution of digits. However, I can make a safer higher bid by increasing the digit to 5, which I have two of. Bidding 4 5s leverages my existing digits and raises the stakes without relying on uncertain assumptions about others' 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s made by Player 2. I have a hand of 71022143, which contains one 7, one 1, one 0, two 2s, one 4, one 3, and one 8, but no 5s. Given that I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than 4 5s, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 5s, I will bid on a digit that I have in my hand. I have two 2s, and bidding 5 2s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and uses a digit from my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s by Player 4. There are 32 total digits. The expected count for any digit is 3.2, so 5 is above average but plausible. Players 0 and 4 have both shown interest in 2s in this and previous rounds, making a challenge risky as they might collectively hold enough 2s. I hold zero 2s, meaning the other 3 players (24 digits) must hold all five 2s for the bid to be true. While possible, the bidding history suggests it might be close. Instead of challenging, I should consider a higher bid. My hand is 33599198. I have two 3s, one 5, one 8, and three 9s. Possible higher bids are 5 3s, 5 4s, 5 5s, 5 6s, 5 7s, 5 8s, 5 9s, or 6+ of any digit. Bidding 5 9s is strongly supported by my hand (I hold 3 of the 5 required). This only requires 2 more 9s among the remaining 24 digits held by other players, which is highly probable. This builds on my previous bid of 3 9s and seems safer than challenging the 5 2s bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand and there are 24 unknown digits. The expected number of 9s among them is 2.4 with a standard deviation of about 1.5, so the chance of four or more 9s in the unknown is only around 22%. That makes a total of five 9s unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand and expect roughly 1.6 more among the 16 unknown digits, making at least three 2s very likely (~81% chance). Opening at 3 2s is a safe first bid that leverages my hand and forces opponents to increase quantity or move to a higher digit.
