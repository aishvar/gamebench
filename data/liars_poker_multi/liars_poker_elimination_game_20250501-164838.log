Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make a safe initial bid. My hand contains two 0s, which is the highest count for any single digit. Bidding 3 0s is reasonable because even if no other player has a 0, the total would be 2 (my hand) + potentially some from others. Since there are 5 other players, it's likely there are at least 3 zeros in total. Starting with a low quantity on a digit I actually hold provides a solid foundation for the bidding.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s and one 0 in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s by Player 0. Since I only have one 0, and there are 48 total digits across 6 players, it’s possible but not highly likely that there are at least two more 0s among the other players. However, challenging at this low bid level is risky as it’s still plausible. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid based on my hand strength. I have two 3s, so bidding 4 3s seems reasonable, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand (07239055). The expected average number of any digit across 48 total digits is 4.8. A bid of 4 is below average and therefore plausible, making a challenge risky, especially early with 6 players. I need to make a higher bid. Options are increasing the quantity to 5 or keeping the quantity at 4 and increasing the digit. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding '4 5s' is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid only requires two more 5s among the remaining 40 digits held by the other 5 players, which is statistically likely. This seems like a safe and strategic bid based on my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand, and the expected total count for any digit across all players is 4.8. Bidding 4 9s builds on my existing holdings and leverages the statistical likelihood that the total count meets or exceeds this bid. This bid is strictly higher than the current 4 5s bid by increasing the digit value while maintaining the same quantity, making it a valid and strategic move.

Player 4 Reasoning: I hold three 9s in my hand. The current bid of 4 9s is plausible (needing just one more among 40 unknown digits). To raise, I’ll bid 5 9s, leveraging my strong holding of 3 and requiring only 2 additional 9s from unknown cards, which remains highly likely.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s, and I have two 9s in my hand. It's unlikely that there are 6 9s in total, so I should challenge this bid. Challenging could eliminate Player 4 and give me a better chance of winning. If I don't challenge, I'd need to bid at least 6 9s to stay in the game, which seems risky given the number of 9s I have.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. With 40 digits total, we expect around four more 9s among the other players (32 cards × 0.1 ≈ 3.2). Bidding 5 9s is a safe opening with an ≈84% chance of being valid, and by using the highest digit I force the next player to raise the quantity to at least 6.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s by Player 4. I have one 9 in my hand. The expected total of 9s across all players is 4.2 (1 in my hand + 3.2 in others' 32 digits). Bidding 6 9s increases the required total to 6, which is less likely but still plausible. Challenging carries risk if the bid is correct. Bidding higher raises the stakes and shifts pressure to others to either bid further or challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 34330038, which contains no 9s. The current bid is 6 9s by Player 0, following a previous bid of 5 9s by Player 4. With 40 total digits across 5 players, a bid of 6 9s means that on average, each player would need to have just over 1 nine in their hand. In the previous round, a challenge on 5 9s revealed an actual count of 8, which suggests 9s are relatively common. Since I have none, it’s possible the other players have enough to make 6 9s plausible. Bidding higher, such as 7 9s, feels risky without any 9s in my hand to support it. However, challenging might be premature since the actual count was 8 last time for just 5 9s with 6 players (48 digits), and now with 5 players (40 digits), 6 9s is still within reason. I’ll bid conservatively to stay in the game and gather more information. I’ll go with 7 0s since I have two 0s in my hand, which gives me some confidence in the digit, and it’s a higher bid in quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. On average, there should be 4 of each digit. I hold two 0s, meaning the other 32 digits need to contain at least 5 more 0s for the bid to be true. This is plausible (5 out of 32 is ~15.6%), but definitely above the average expectation (3.2 out of 32). Challenging is an option, but the bid isn't extremely unlikely. Alternatively, I can make a higher bid. My hand contains two 5s (07239055). Bidding 7 5s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires 5 more 5s among the other 32 digits, which has the same likelihood from my perspective as the current bid of 7 0s. Given the moderate risk of challenging, making a plausible bid based on my hand strength is a safer and reasonable move, passing the pressure to the next player.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 5s. My hand contains no 5s, and with 40 total digits across 5 players, the expected number of 5s is around 4 (assuming uniform distribution). Player 2's bid of 7 5s requires at least 7 5s in the remaining 32 digits (other players' hands), which is statistically unlikely given the expected average. Since the probability of the actual count being ≥7 is low, challenging is the optimal move.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand. Bidding 4 1s is reasonable since it only requires one additional 1 among the other 24 digits (3 players * 8 digits) to meet the bid. This is statistically plausible given the average distribution of digits, and starting with a bid based on my strongest digit (1) gives a solid foundation for the round.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand and the current bid is only 4 1s. By bidding 4 9s I only need one more 9 among the other 24 cards, which is very likely (~92%). This is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and puts pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, but also two 0s. Bidding 5 0s increases the quantity from 4 to 5, which is a valid higher bid. Since I have two 0s, and there are three other players with 8 digits each, it's plausible there are enough 0s to meet the bid. Challenging the 4 9s bid carries risk, as the minimum possible 9s (if others have none) is 1 (my hand), but if others have at least three 9s, the bid is valid. Bidding 5 0s leverages my existing digits and forces others to respond.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 34330038, which contains two 0s, two 3s, one 4, one 8, and no 1s, 2s, 5s, 6s, 7s, or 9s. The current bid is 5 0s by Player 0. Since I have two 0s in my hand, that leaves only 3 more 0s needed among the other 24 digits (3 players with 8 digits each) to meet the bid. This seems plausible given that 0s might be distributed across players. Challenging now feels risky as the likelihood of at least 5 total 0s is reasonable. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. I can bid 6 0s to increase the quantity, staying with a digit I have some of in my hand to make the bid more believable. This also pressures the next player to either raise the bid further or challenge. My bid of 6 0s feels like a safe incremental increase while still being strategic.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. With 32 total digits remaining, the expected average count per digit is 3.2. Since I have no 0s in my 8-digit hand, the other three players must collectively hold all 6+ 0s for the bid to be valid. This is statistically unlikely given the average, and Player 1’s aggressive bid may be a bluff. Challenging leverages the low probability of 6+ 0s existing across all hands.
