Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have the digits 91024615, which means I have one 0. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits in total. My hand contributes one 0. To make an informed bid, I should consider the likelihood of other players having 0s. A reasonable next bid should be higher than 2 0s. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 0, and there are 5 other players, it's plausible that there are more 0s. Bidding 3 0s seems like a reasonable increase in quantity. Alternatively, bidding 2 1s is also valid as it increases the digit. Given that I don't have any 1s, bidding 2 1s might be too optimistic, so increasing the quantity to 3 0s is a safer bet.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 0s. With 5 other players, it's possible that there are 3 0s among them, but it's a risky bid to challenge. However, since I have a good hand with higher digits (7, 9), I can make a safer bid by increasing the digit to something I have more of, like 7s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Since I have two 8s and there are 40 digits across other players, it's likely there's at least one 8 in total. Challenging the current bid is risky because the 3 7s claim is almost certainly true given my two 7s and the high probability of at least one 7 in remaining digits.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 3. I have the hand 50734441, which contains one 8. Given that there are 6 active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total number of digits is 48. The bid of 3 8s seems somewhat reasonable but not extremely high. I can try to make a higher bid or challenge. Since I have one 8 and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48, bidding slightly higher seems reasonable. I will bid 4 8s as it is a straightforward increase in quantity with the same digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have the hand 91024615, which contains one 0. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. The total count of 0s across all players is likely to be more than 5 since Player 0 started with 2 0s and I bid 3 0s. However, I should be cautious not to bid too high. I can see that my hand has a variety of digits but only one 0. Bidding 6 0s might be too aggressive. Instead, I can bid the same quantity but a higher digit. Thus, bidding 5 1s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit and keeps the quantity the same.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 1s. The bidding has been increasing, and I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 5 7s is a valid move, increasing the digit from 1 to 7 while keeping the quantity the same, which is a higher bid. Given my hand, this seems reasonable.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. My hand contains two 7s and two 8s. Bidding 5 8s increases the digit while maintaining the quantity, leveraging my two 8s. The expected total 8s across all players is 4.8, making 5 a plausible but not guaranteed count. Challenging carries equal risk/reward but passing the decision to the next player by bidding is strategically safer.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s made by Player 3. I have 8s in my hand (two 8s). To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 6 8s would be a straightforward increase in quantity, but given that I have two 8s, I should consider if challenging could be more beneficial or if another bid is more strategic.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. With 6 players each holding 8 digits (total 48), the average number of 9s per player is 0.8, making 6 9s statistically unlikely. Since I have no 9s in my hand and the bid requires at least 6, challenging is a reasonable risk to test if the bid is a bluff.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s, made by Player 5. My hand is 91024615, which contains one 0. With 4 other players having 8 digits each, it's reasonable to assume there could be more 0s. I can bid higher than 1 0s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 0, bidding 2 0s seems plausible. Alternatively, I could bid 1 1s, but that doesn't take into account the potential for more 0s. Bidding 2 0s is a reasonable next step.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand (73791098). The current bid is 2 0s, which is relatively low. With 5 players remaining and 40 total digits, it's plausible that there are at least 3 0s in total. I can increase the bid to 3 0s, which is a safe move based on the current bid and my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have zero 0s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s. Challenging risks elimination if others have 3+ 0s (expected ~3.2 based on 32 remaining digits). Bidding 3 2s is safer: I have one 2, making it plausible others have 2 more. Increasing the digit (0→2) creates a valid higher bid while leveraging my hand's composition.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s made by Player 3. I have the hand 50734441, which contains two 4s, one 7, one 0, and three 1s, and other digits. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Given that I have no 2s in my hand, I should consider bidding on a digit that I have. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40, and with 40 total digits remaining and 5 players, it's plausible that higher digits could have a lower count. I will bid on 1s, as I have three 1s and the current bid is 3 2s. Bidding 4 1s seems reasonable as it's higher in quantity than 3 2s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current round has just started with 4 active players, including me (Player 4). No bids have been made yet. My hand is 50734441. I see that I have 2 4s and 2 1s. Since there are no current bids, I can make the first bid. I will start with a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 2 4s seems reasonable as it's a low but valid bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have the digits 91024615, which means I have one 4. With 8 digits and one 4, it's reasonable to assume that other players might have 4s as well. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I see that I have a 5 and a 6, and potentially other players could have these digits too, bidding 2 5s seems like a reasonable next step as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand (from 73791098). The current bid is 2 5s, which means there needs to be at least one more 5 among the other three players' hands. This seems plausible, so I will make a higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 3 7s is a reasonable increase in both quantity and digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 7s and two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 3 8s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Given the high probability that there is at least one 8 in the remaining 24 digits across other players' hands (92% chance), this bid is more likely to be true than challenging the existing bid, which has an 8% chance of being false.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 3. I have the hand 50734441, which contains one 8. Given that there are 4 active players and each has 8 secret digits, there are a total of 32 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. Since I have one 8 and there are 3 other players, it's possible but unlikely that there are 3 or more 8s in total. However, I don't have enough information to be certain. I will bid higher than 3 8s by increasing the quantity because I have a moderate digit (4) in my hand and it's safer to increase quantity with a lower digit than to challenge without strong evidence.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have the digits 91024615, which means I have one 4. The total count of 4s must be at least 1 (mine) + 1 (minimum from each of the other 3 players, assuming they have at least one 4 like I do, but it's not guaranteed). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 is a reasonable step as it reflects a possible total count if other players also have 4s. My hand doesn't have many high digits, so bidding 5 4s seems plausible and is a safer increase in quantity rather than jumping to a much higher digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 5 4s, which seems high given that there are only 32 digits total and I only have one.

Since there's no current bid, I need to make the first bid. I see I have one 5 and other varied digits. A reasonable starting bid considering my hand and the total number of digits could be to bid on a digit I have, increasing the likelihood it's in others' hands as well.

The bid of 3 8s seems plausible but not extremely high. However, I can try to make a higher bid. I have one 8 and can see if I can make a reasonable bid. Bidding 4 8s would be higher in quantity but risky without knowing others' hands. Alternatively, I could bid with a different digit. I have multiple 4s and 5s, but I need to ensure my bid is higher than 3 8s. Bidding 4 4s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 24 total digits and 3 players, a reasonable estimate is that there are around 8 digits per player. My hand doesn't have many high digits, but I can try to increase the quantity or digit slightly.

Given that there are 24 total digits remaining across 3 players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. The current bid of 4 8s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. Since my hand has two 4s and no 8s, and considering the bids so far, I can try to bid higher on 4s or 8s. Bidding 5 4s seems reasonable as it utilizes my hand and increases the quantity.

To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 24 total digits and the current bid is 5 4s, I can analyze the likelihood. I already have one 4, so at least one 4 exists. A bid of 6 4s seems plausible because it only requires one more 4 across the other two players' hands. However, increasing the digit is also an option. Bidding 5 5s is a reasonable choice because it keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit. Given that I have one 5 in my hand, it's possible that the total count of 5s could be at least 5 across all hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Since the total digits remaining are 16, bidding 3 8s is a reasonable starting point. I need only one 8 in Player 4's hand to make the bid valid, which is plausible. Bidding on a digit I hold increases the likelihood of the bid being true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 3. I have the hand 50734441, which contains one 8. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. The bid of 3 8s seems high but not impossible. However, I do not have enough information to be certain it's a bluff. I will make a bid that is higher in quantity to challenge Player 3's potential hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. The total possible 8s are 2 (mine) + up to 8 (Player 4's digits). The bid claims at least 4 total 8s. If Player 4 has 2 or more 8s, the bid is valid. However, the probability that Player 4 has only 0 or 1 8s (making the bid invalid) is ~81.3% under random distribution. Challenging is statistically favorable here.
