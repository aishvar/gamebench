Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s. Since there is no current bid, I can start with a bid based on my own digits. Bidding 2 9s is a logical first move as it reflects the actual count in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I already hold three 9s, so the current bid of 2 9s is certainly true. Raising to 4 9s is still very safe: with 40 unseen digits, the chance that at least one more 9 exists is about 98%, making this a low-risk, higher-pressure bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits. The expected number of any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8. The bid of 4 9s is slightly below the expected average. I have zero 9s in my hand (16131012), meaning the other 5 players (40 digits) must have at least four 9s. The expected number of 9s among those 40 digits is 4. Given Player 0 also bid 9s, challenging seems risky as the bid is quite plausible. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains four 1s, which is a strong suit. The next possible quantity is 5. Bidding 5 1s would require only one more 1 from the remaining 40 digits (where 4 are expected), making it very safe. Bidding 6 1s requires two more 1s from the remaining 40 digits (where 4 are expected), which is still statistically very likely and applies more pressure. I will bid 6 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 62105275, which contains one 1. The current bid is 6 1s by Player 2, meaning they are claiming there are at least six 1s across all players' hands. With 48 total digits and 6 players, the average number of a specific digit per player is about 4.8, so 6 1s is slightly above average but plausible. However, since I only have one 1, and the bid jumped from 4 9s to 6 1s, it feels a bit aggressive. I could challenge, but the risk is high as 6 1s is not an extreme bid. Instead, I’ll make a safer bid of 6 2s, as I have two 2s in my hand, which gives me some confidence in the digit, and it meets the requirement of a higher bid by increasing the digit while maintaining the quantity.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 6 2s. I see that there have been some high bids on 9s and 1s, suggesting that these digits might be more common. However, I have two 5s, and since the current bid is 6 2s, bidding 7 5s seems like a reasonable next step, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity close to the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 5s. My hand contains one 5, and with 48 total digits across all players, having 8 5s would require other players to collectively hold 7 more 5s. Given the previous bids and my limited 5s, this seems improbable. Challenging reduces the risk of supporting an overinflated bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I already have three 9s in my own hand. With 32 unknown digits across the four other players, the expected additional number of 9s is about 3 (32 × 0.1). The probability that there are at least two more 9s among those 32 digits is well over 80%. Therefore a bid of 5 9s is very likely to be accurate while comfortably raising the quantity over the current 2 9s bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. I have zero 9s in my hand (16131012). The expected number of 9s among the other 32 digits is 3.2. While 5 9s is higher than the average expectation based only on the unknown digits, Player 1 jumped from Player 0's bid of 2 9s, suggesting they might hold several 9s, making the bid plausible. Challenging seems risky. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains four 1s. The expected number of 1s among the other 32 digits is 3.2. Therefore, the total expected number of 1s is 4 + 3.2 = 7.2. Bidding 7 1s is statistically well-supported by my hand and the overall distribution. It's a higher bid than 5 9s (higher quantity) and leverages my strong hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 62105275, which contains one 1. The current bid is 7 1s by Player 2. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, an average of 4 ones per player would be needed to reach a total of 20 ones, but 7 ones is still plausible as it’s below average distribution. I don’t have strong evidence to challenge since my single 1 doesn’t significantly lower the likelihood of 7 ones existing. Bidding higher, I can go to 7 2s since I have two 2s in my hand, which feels safer than escalating the quantity to 8 for a lower digit. This keeps the bid competitive while aligning with my hand strength.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 2s. I have two 2s in my hand. With 40 digits remaining and 5 players, it's plausible that there are more 2s. However, bidding on 2s might be risky as Player 3, who made the last bid, might challenge. I have three 5s in my hand, and previously, there were bids on 5s, suggesting they are common. Bidding 8 5s is a reasonable increase in both quantity and digit, leveraging my hand and the game history.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 5s. My hand contains one 5, and considering the previous challenge on 8 5s revealed a count of 5, it's unlikely there are 8 fives now. Challenging this bid is a reasonable risk given the low probability of 8 fives existing across 40 digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: I can see three 9s in my own eight-digit hand (7 9 4 9 8 6 9 8). Since the current bid is only 2 9s, I already exceed it, so challenging would almost certainly fail. I should raise the bid. Moving to 4 9s is still well-supported: I need just one additional 9 among the 24 unseen digits, which has roughly a 90% chance of being true, yet it puts meaningful pressure on the next player and may draw an overconfident challenge later.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. There are 32 total digits. The expected number of any digit is 3.2. I have zero 9s. While 4 9s is slightly above average, it's plausible given Player 0 also bid 9s. Challenging is risky. My hand is 16131012, which contains four 1s. This is a very strong holding. The next possible bid is 5 0s. Bidding on my own strong suit is preferable. A bid of '5 1s' requires only one more 1 among the other 24 digits (expected number is 2.4), making it extremely safe. A bid of '6 1s' requires two more 1s among the other 24 digits. The probability of there being at least two more 1s is reasonably high (around 70%). Given my previous high bids on 1s in earlier rounds (6 1s with 48 digits, 7 1s with 40 digits), bidding '6 1s' now is consistent, leverages my strong hand, and puts significant pressure on the next player. It's a calculated risk but better than challenging or making the minimum safe bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 62105275, which contains one 1 and two 2s. The current bid is 6 1s by Player 2. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 6 1s means that, on average, each player would need to have about 1.5 ones, which is plausible. I only have one 1, so it's possible the other players have more to make up the total. Bidding higher, I can go to 6 2s since I have two 2s myself, and it's a reasonable increase in digit while maintaining the quantity. This bid feels safer than challenging, as 6 1s isn't excessively high. I’ll avoid challenging for now and bid 6 2s to keep the game moving and test the other players.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. My hand contains one 2, but the total digits across all players is 32. With no information on others' hands, the bid could be inflated.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. There are 24 total digits. The expected number of 9s is 2.4. I have zero 9s. For the bid to be true, the other two players need three 9s combined across their 16 digits. Player 0 bid 2 9s and Player 1 raised to 3 9s, suggesting they might collectively hold 3 9s. Challenging seems risky as the bid is low. I must bid higher, meaning at least 4 of any digit. My hand is 16131012, containing four 1s. Bidding based on my strongest digit is a good strategy. Bidding 4 1s is extremely safe as I already hold all 4. Bidding 5 1s requires only one more 1 from the remaining 16 digits held by the other two players, which is statistically likely (approx. 81.5% chance assuming random distribution). Bidding 5 1s is still relatively safe and puts more pressure on the next player (Player 0) than the minimum bid of 4 1s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 1. There are 16 total digits (8 for me, 8 for Player 1). I have zero 9s in my hand (16131012). For the bid to be true, Player 1 must hold at least three 9s in their 8-digit hand, which is statistically unlikely (expected number of 9s in 8 digits is 0.8). Challenging is a strong option. However, I have four 1s in my hand. Bidding 4 1s is a guaranteed safe bid, as the total count of 1s is definitely at least four (just from my hand). This bid is higher than 3 9s (higher quantity). Making a safe bid leverages my strong hand of 1s and puts the pressure back on Player 1 without risking immediate elimination on a challenge, even if the challenge seems likely to succeed.
