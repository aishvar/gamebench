Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold three 4s (44 4) in my own eight digits. With 40 unseen digits among the other five players, the chance that there is at least one additional 4 is very high (about 98%). Opening with “4 4s” is therefore a strong but safe first bid that is unlikely to be immediately false and still leaves room for future raises.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 5 4s would be a reasonable bluff, as it's a direct increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have one 8, so bidding 1 8s is possible, but unlikely to win. I have one 7, one 6, one 5, one 3, and two 8s. Bidding 5 4s is the most logical next step, as it leverages the digits I have and increases the bid in a believable way.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 79610291, which contains one 4. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits total. The current bid is 5 4s. Statistically, the expected number of any given digit among 48 random digits is about 4.8, so 5 4s is a reasonable bid. Since I only have one 4, it is risky to raise the quantity, but I can safely make a higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I will bid 5 5s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. My hand contains one 5, and I can bid a higher digit (6) with the same quantity (5) to increase the bid. This is a valid move as it meets the 'higher' criteria by increasing the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s, which is very low. I have two 7s in my hand. Given that there are 40 digits remaining across 5 players, it's reasonable to bid higher. Bidding 2 7s increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a strong bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my own hand. With 32 unknown digits still in play, the probability that at least one more 4 is among them is very high (about 97%). By raising the bid to 4 4s I increase the quantity from 2 to 4, making a strictly higher bid that is still extremely safe from my perspective.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have zero 4s in my hand. Player 0 just bid 4 4s, and given the previous challenge and elimination, it's possible they are bluffing. However, there are still 40 total digits in play across 5 players (8 digits each). It's risky to challenge immediately. I can bid higher. I have two 8s, so bidding 5 8s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity. This is a higher bid than 4 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 79610291, which contains one 8. The current bid is 5 8s, meaning at least five 8s among the 40 digits. With only one 8 in my hand, there need to be at least four more 8s among the remaining 32 digits. Statistically, the expected number of 8s in 32 random digits is about 3.2, making the bid already a bit aggressive but not impossible. However, since the bid is not extremely unlikely, I should not challenge yet. To continue, I need to make a higher bid. I will bid 5 9s, as I have two 9s, making it a slightly safer bid for me while only increasing the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 7s and two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 6 0s. Bidding 7 7s is a reasonable move because it increases the quantity from 6 to 7 and uses a digit I have in my hand. This bid is likely to be higher than the current bid and challenging the last bid is too risky, as there are still 40 digits remaining and 0s are common.

Player 5 bids: 7 7s

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:0 - o3-2025-04-16) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I see only two 7s in my hand. With 40 digits total, the expected count of any specific digit is about four. For the current bid of 7 7s to be true, the other four players would have to supply at least five more 7s—well above expectation. Although Player 5 may hold several 7s, the bid still looks optimistic. Any legal raise I could make (e.g., 8 of some digit) would be even less likely to be correct, exposing me to a worse challenge later. Overall, challenging now gives me the best chance to eliminate Player 5 while avoiding an even riskier bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since no bids have been made yet, I can start with a reasonable bid. Bidding 3 9s seems like a safe starting point, as it's unlikely that any player has more than two 9s, and it's a higher digit than any previous bids in this game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Given the limited number of total digits (32) and only 4 players remaining, a bid of 3 9s seems plausible, but not overwhelmingly so. However, increasing the quantity to 4 9s feels risky without having any 9s myself. A safer option is to bid 4 8s, as I have two 8s in my hand, and the previous round saw a bid of 5 8s. This increases both the quantity and leverages my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 79610291, which contains two 9s and one 8. The current bid is 4 8s. With 32 digits in play, the expected number of any digit is about 3.2. I only have one 8, so for there to be 4 or more 8s, the other three players would need to collectively have at least 3 additional 8s. This is possible but not highly likely. However, since I have two 9s, increasing the bid to 4 9s is a safer way to keep the bidding alive, as I personally hold half the required 9s. Therefore, I will bid 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have two 9s in my hand. To make a valid bid, I need to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 9s, bidding 6 9s is a reasonable move, increasing both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid. Additionally, the previous bids and challenges suggest that high bids on 9s have been successful, indicating that other players might also have 9s. Challenging seems risky given the recent successful high bids on 9s.

Given that there are only 32 total digits remaining across 4 players (8 digits each), and Player 2 and Player 5 have already bid on 9s, it's unlikely there are 6 or more 9s in total.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 79610291. I have the following digits: 7, 9, 6, 1, 0, 2, 9, 1. I have zero 8s in my hand. With 24 digits in play and only three players, the expected number of any digit is about 2.4. The bid is 3 8s, which is slightly above expectation, and given that I have none, it would require all 3 to be in the other two hands (16 digits total). The probability of neither of my opponents having an 8 is low but possible; however, the probability that both together have at least 3 is not very high. Given the risk, and that I have none, it's a good time to challenge.
