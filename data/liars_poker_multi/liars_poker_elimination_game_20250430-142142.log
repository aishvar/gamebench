Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since I'm the first to bid, I need to make a strategic opening move. Looking at my hand (04539389), I have two 9s and two 3s, which are my most frequent digits. Starting with a moderate bid based on what I have in my hand is a good strategy. I'll bid 3 9s since I have two 9s myself, and it's reasonable to expect at least one more 9 among the other 40 digits held by other players. This is a relatively strong opening that's not too aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 9s and my hand containing one 9, I need to consider the likelihood of there being at least three 9s among all players. Since each player has 8 digits and there are 6 players, the total number of digits in play is 48. My hand contributes one 9 to this total. Without specific knowledge of other players' hands, I must strategically decide whether to bid higher or challenge. A safe strategy would be to slightly increase the quantity or digit value, considering the distribution of digits in my hand and the potential distribution among other players. However, since my hand does not offer a clear advantage in any particular digit that would safely allow me to increase the bid significantly, and considering the current bid is relatively low, I should think about challenging if the bid seems unlikely or making a cautious increase.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:3 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand (44651953). The current bid is 4 0s. Since I contribute zero 0s, the remaining five players must account for all 4 0s. With 40 digits remaining, the probability of exactly 4 0s is plausible, but the bid is at the expected value (40 digits * 10% = 4). Challenging is a calculated risk to eliminate an opponent if the bid is false, especially since I have no 0s to support it.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains two 5s. Given 5 players each with 8 digits, the average total for any digit is around 4. Bidding 4 5s is plausible since I have two, and others may have at least two more. This bid is moderate and leverages my hand's strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have zero 5s in my hand. Given that there are 5 players with 8 digits each, there are a total of 40 digits. It's unlikely there are 4 or more 5s among all players, especially since Player 1 was eliminated after a challenge on a bid of 4 0s. Challenging seems like the best course of action.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 4 5s is plausible because there are three other players, each with 8 digits. Even if only two more 5s exist across their hands, the total count would meet the bid. This bid is conservative yet leverages my own holdings and allows room for escalation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (04539389), I have zero 6s. The current bid is 5 6s from Player 5. With 4 players and 8 digits each, there are 32 total digits in play. For there to be 5 or more 6s, the other three players would need to have at least 5 6s between them, averaging 1.67 6s per player. This is possible but somewhat unlikely. However, I need to consider that Player 5 made this bid confidently, possibly having multiple 6s in their hand. Since I have two 9s in my hand, I could bid 5 9s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit. Alternatively, I could increase to 6 of a lower digit, but that's riskier given the current bid level. Since I have no 6s and the bid is already at 5, challenging seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of this round. Looking at my hand (04539389), I have one 0, one 4, one 5, one 3, two 9s, and one 8. Since I have two 9s in my hand, this is my strongest digit. With 3 players and 8 digits each (24 total digits), I can reasonably expect there to be at least 3-4 of my strongest digit (9) across all hands. Starting with a conservative bid of 3 9s is reasonable - I already have 2 of them, so I only need one more among the other 16 digits held by other players.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:3 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. The expected total number of 9s in all 24 digits is 2.4 (24 * 1/10). A bid of 3 is slightly above this average, but still plausible. However, the probability of exactly 3 or fewer 9s is higher than 3 or more. Challenging this bid offers a reasonable chance to eliminate Player 0 if the actual count is less than 3, which aligns with the expected value. Given the history of successful challenges in previous rounds, this is a calculated risk worth taking.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding in this final round against Player 4. Looking at my hand (04539389), I have two 9s and two 3s, which are my most frequent digits. Since I have two 9s already, and there are 16 total digits in play (8 from me, 8 from Player 4), I can reasonably bid on 9s. A conservative starting bid would be 3 9s, which means I'm betting there's at least one more 9 in Player 4's hand. This is a reasonable opening bid since I already hold 2 of them, and the probability of at least one 9 in 8 random digits is fairly good.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand (positions 5 and 7). Player 4 has bid that there are 4 9s total between our hands. Since I have 2 9s, this means Player 4 would need to have at least 2 9s as well for their bid to be valid. This is certainly possible, but I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Looking at my options for a higher bid: I could bid 5 9s, but that would require Player 4 to have 3 9s, which seems less likely. I could also switch to a different digit. I have two 3s, one 8, one 5, one 4, one 0, and one 9 in my hand. The safest bid would be based on a digit I have multiple of. I could bid 5 0s, but I only have one 0, so Player 4 would need 4 0s. I could bid 5 3s, which means Player 4 would need 3 3s. Given the uncertainty, and the fact that Player 4's bid of 4 9s requires them to have at least 2 9s (which is plausible but not guaranteed), I'll challenge their bid.
