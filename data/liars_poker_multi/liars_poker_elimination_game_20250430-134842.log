Player 0 Reasoning: Since there have been no previous bids and I have two 3s and one 8 in my hand, I can infer that there are at least three 3s and one 8 in play. Bidding 4 3s seems like a good starting point, as it's likely there are at least four 3s among all players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand (60947352). To make 4 total 4s, I need 3 more among the 40 unknown digits. The probability of at least 3 out of 40 being 4s at p=0.1 is about 78%, making 4 4s a reasonable minimal raise and preserves flexibility.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 4 5s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages the possibility that other players may have more 5s, making the bid plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. This bid is plausible, as the average expected count for any digit among 48 total digits is 4.8. Challenging it would be risky. My hand contains two 9s. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is well-supported by my hand, requiring only two additional 9s from the remaining 40 digits held by other players. This seems like a strong and reasonable move.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 9s' by Player 3, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have one 9 in my hand (90763391), and considering the total number of digits remaining is 48, bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity seems reasonable. However, given that the digit 9 is already at a high level and increasing the quantity further might be risky without sufficient information, I should consider the next higher digit. The next higher digit after 9 would be challenging since we're at the top of the digit range. Thus, the logical step is to increase the quantity of the current highest bid digit, which is 9, or look for a digit that could potentially have a higher count given its lower value and thus higher potential occurrence rate across all players' hands. Since my hand contains two 3s and given the bidding history started with '4 3s', it suggests that 3s might be relatively common. However, to strictly increase the bid, I must consider either increasing the quantity of 9s or moving to a digit that could allow for a higher quantity bid. Given the constraints and aiming for a conservative yet strategic move, increasing the quantity of 9s seems like the most straightforward path to a higher bid, considering I already have one 9 and the total number of digits is 48, allowing for a potential higher count of 9s across all players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 5 9s, which means there would need to be four more 9s among the other five players (total of 40 digits). Given that the previous bids have been relatively low and the digit 9 is less common, it's unlikely there are four more 9s in the other hands. Therefore, challenging seems like the best move.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current state of the game, I have a hand with digits 90763391. Since the current bid is 'None', I need to make a bid that is higher than nothing, essentially making the first bid of the round. Considering my hand, I have three 3s and no other digit appears more than twice. However, since I need to make a bid that considers the total count across all players, I should aim for a digit that is reasonable to expect in higher quantities across all hands. Given that I have no 0s, 1s, 2s, 4s, 5s, 7s, or 8s, and considering the previous round's bids which were focused on higher digits, a conservative start would be to bid on a digit that I have but also consider the total pool of digits. Since the total digits remaining are 40 and there are 5 players, each having 8 digits, I should consider what's likely given the distribution. My hand suggests I could bid on 3s since I have three of them, but given the lack of information on other players' hands and the need to start the bidding, I will choose a digit that seems plausible to exist in a decent quantity across all hands. Given the previous round's focus on higher digits, starting with a lower digit that I have in my hand seems prudent to avoid overbidding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. Given that there are 40 digits remaining and 5 players, it's likely that there are at least 4 3s in total. However, I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 4 6s seems like a reasonable move to increase both the quantity and the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand and the expected total of sixes is about 4.2, so challenging 4 6s is only ~35% to succeed. Instead I should raise minimally by keeping quantity at 4 and increasing the digit. I also have one 7, and the expected total of 7s is about 4.2, giving ~65% chance that at least four 7s exist. Thus bidding 4 7s is a reasonable move.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. Since there are 40 total digits and I already have two 7s, it's possible the actual count is less than 4. Challenging this bid could be a strategic move if I believe the total 7s across all players are insufficient to meet the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one zero in my hand. With 32 total digits, the expected total number of zeros is about 3.2, making a bid of 3 zeros a reasonable, conservative opening. Choosing the lowest digit also forces opponents to raise the quantity if they want to outbid me.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. My hand is 49912653, containing two 9s. With 4 players and 8 digits each, there are 32 total digits. The expected count for any digit is 3.2. Given I have two 9s, the expected total count of 9s across all hands is approximately 2 (my hand) + 2.4 (from the other 24 digits) = 4.4. Bidding 4 9s is a plausible claim based on this expectation and my hand strength, and it is a valid higher bid than 3 0s.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 9s' by Player 3 and considering my hand '90763391', which contains one '9', I must assess the likelihood of there being at least four '9s' among all active players. Since there are 32 digits in total and each player has 8 digits, the maximum number of '9s' any single player can have is 8. However, given that my hand only contains one '9', and without knowledge of other players' hands, I must consider the distribution of '9s' across all players. The bid '4 9s' seems plausible but challenging it could be a strategic move if I believe the actual count of '9s' is less than 4. Considering the game history and the fact that I have previously bid '5 9s' and won, indicating a higher presence of '9s', I must weigh the risk of challenging versus making a higher bid. Since I need to make a strictly higher bid than '4 9s', and considering the digits available, bidding a higher quantity of '9s' or the same quantity with a higher digit is necessary. Given the constraints and my hand, I decide to challenge the bid as making a higher bid (e.g., '5 9s' or higher quantity of a higher digit) seems risky without more information about other players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: It is the start of a new round, and I am the first to bid. The current bid is 'None'. My hand is 49912653, containing two 9s. There are 3 players total, with 8 digits each (24 total digits). The average expected count for any digit is 2.4 (24 / 10). Since I have two 9s, bidding 3 9s is a reasonable starting bid. It's based on my hand strength and is a plausible total count across 24 digits.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, but I need to bid higher. I have two 3s and one 6 in my hand. Player 1 previously bid 4 7s, which was challenged and won. The highest quantity bid so far was 5 9s, which was challenged and won. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing the digit based on my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 2 9s gives me about a 57% chance to be correct (opponent needs at least one 9 among 8 unknown cards), and since 9 is the highest digit they can’t overcall at quantity 2—they must raise to 3s or challenge, putting them under pressure.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s, made by Player 1. My hand contains two 9s, which means the total count of 9s is at least 2. Therefore, Player 1's bid of 2 9s is guaranteed to be true, and I cannot challenge it. I must make a higher bid. The lowest possible higher bid is 3 of any digit. My hand has two 9s. Bidding 3 9s requires the total count of 9s to be at least 3. Since I have two, Player 1 needs to have at least one 9. This is the most probable quantity-3 bid to be true based on my hand, compared to bidding 3 of a digit I only hold one of (requiring Player 1 to have two) or a digit I hold zero of (requiring Player 1 to have three).
