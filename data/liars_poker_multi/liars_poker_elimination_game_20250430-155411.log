Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and need to make the first bid as the current bid is 'None'. My hand is 20585156, and I have three 5s, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total digits), the expected number of any digit is 4.8. Since I hold three 5s, the expected total number of 5s across all hands is 3 (mine) + (40 other digits / 10) = 7. An opening bid of '3 5s' is directly supported by my hand, is statistically very likely to be true, and establishes a reasonable starting point based on my strongest digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand and challenging 3 5s seems risky since the expected count is around 4.8. The minimal valid raise is to 3 6s; I hold one 6, and needing two more among the other 40 cards is plausible. Therefore I should bid 3 6s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s. Bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid, as it maintains the same quantity but increases the digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have two 6s and one 7 in my hand. Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable increase in quantity while maintaining the same digit, leveraging the single 7 in my hand. Challenging seems risky because the bid is not excessively high.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 7s and I have two 7s in my hand (73012328), increasing the quantity to 5 while keeping the digit the same seems reasonable. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48 and we are still in the early stages of the game, bidding 5 7s appears to be a plausible next step. This bid is strictly higher than the current bid, adhering to the game's rules.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand. Since the current bid is 5 7s, bidding 6 1s increases the quantity to a higher level than the current bid, leveraging my strong holding of 1s. This bid forces opponents to respond to a higher-count bid focused on a digit I already hold multiple of, creating strategic pressure.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:2 - google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. There are 48 total digits (6 players * 8 digits). The expected number of any digit is 4.8. I have one 1 in my hand (20585156). This means there need to be at least 5 more 1s among the other 40 digits held by the other 5 players. The expected number of 1s in those 40 digits is 40/10 = 4. Needing 5 when 4 are expected is plausible, making a challenge risky. I should consider a higher bid. My hand contains three 5s. A bid of 6 5s would require only 3 more 5s from the remaining 40 digits (expected 4), which is safe. A bid of 7 5s would require 4 more 5s from the remaining 40 digits, which matches the expected value exactly. Given my strong holding of three 5s, bidding 7 5s is a statistically sound and strong bid that puts pressure on the next player, and seems safer than challenging the 6 1s bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have 0 5s in my hand. There are 40 unknown cards and we expect about 4 5s among them, making a total of ~4 5s on average. The probability of there being at least 7 5s is very low (around 11%), so Player 0â€™s bid of 7 5s is unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: I hold three 0s in my hand and there are 32 unknown digits. At p=0.1 per digit, I expect about 3.2 more zeros, giving around 6.2 zeros total. Bidding 6 zeros is both plausible and strong as an opening move.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand. With 32 total digits and an expected 3.2 zeros, the chance of at least one more zero in the 24 unknown cards is about 92%. Bidding 4 0s is a strong yet plausible opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which means that there are at least 3 6s in the game. The current bid of 4 0s is reasonable, but I can bid higher by increasing the digit. Since I have two 6s, I can bid 4 6s, which is a valid higher bid. I'm not challenging because I have a 6 in my hand, making a bid with 6s a reasonable move. I am not sure about the distribution of other digits, but I know that there are at least 3 6s in the game, so bidding 4 6s is a safe move.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 6s' by Player 3 and considering my hand '73012328', I notice I have no 6s. However, looking at the total digits remaining (32) and the fact that we are bidding on the total count across all players, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least 4 sixes. Since I don't have any 6s and given the distribution of digits, bidding higher on 6s seems risky. Instead, I could consider bidding on a different digit that might be more plausible given the total count of digits remaining and the bids made so far. For instance, bidding on a lower digit that I have more of could be strategic. However, since my hand contains multiple occurrences of the digit '3' and '1' and given that bidding must be strictly higher than '4 6s', I need to think about increasing the quantity or the digit. Considering the game history and the elimination process, players have been cautious with their bids, suggesting they might have a good understanding of the digit distribution. Given my hand and the need to make a strictly higher bid, I must weigh the risks of challenging versus making a higher bid. Since I have two '3's and given the total number of digits, challenging the current bid of '4 6s' seems like a reasonable option because I don't have enough information to confidently bid higher on any digit, especially considering the risk of overbidding and being challenged myself.

Player 4 Reasoning: Given that I have the hand 73012328 and it's the start of the round with no previous bids, I should consider making a bid that seems reasonable based on my hand. Since I have two 3s, bidding on the digit 3 seems like a good starting point. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 24 and there are 3 players, including myself, I should start with a conservative but plausible bid. Bidding 4 3s seems like a balanced choice, considering my own hand and the potential distribution of digits among other players.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand. Bidding 5 1s builds on this strength, assuming at least two more 1s exist among the other two players (total of 24 digits). This bid increases the quantity from the current 4 3s, leveraging my confidence in the 1s count.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 1s in my hand. To meet Player 5â€™s bid of 5 1s, the other two players would need to hold all 5 1s among their 16 unknown digits. With an expected 1.6 1s in 16 digits (sd â‰ˆ1.2), getting 5 or more is extremely unlikely (under 1%). Therefore Player 5 is almost certainly bluffing and I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 0s' and my hand '73012328', I notice that I have no zeros. Considering the total digits remaining is 16 and we are down to the last two players, each having 8 digits, the bid of '4 0s' seems plausible but not extremely likely. However, without any zeros in my hand and the need to make a strictly higher bid, I must consider the probability of higher digits. Since I have multiple instances of '3', '1', and '2', but especially considering the bidding history where '7' has been a point of interest, I should look for a digit that could reasonably exceed the current bid's quantity or digit value. Given that '4 0s' is the current bid, and I have two '3's, bidding on '3's or higher seems reasonable. Yet, the safest increase, considering I don't have to go very high to surpass '4 0s', would be to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two '3's and the game has seen interest in higher digits, I could consider bidding on a higher digit if I had enough instances or had a reason to believe my opponent does. However, given the information and aiming for a conservative yet strategic move, challenging seems less favorable without a strong conviction that '4 0s' is unlikely. Thus, making a bid that is reasonably higher and considering my hand's composition, I should look for a balance between the digit's presence in my hand and its likelihood across all hands. Given these considerations and the fact that I need to surpass '4 0s', a logical step would be to consider digits I have in abundance or those previously bid upon, taking into account the game's progression and the elimination process.
