Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. With 6 players and 48 digits total, the expected count for any given digit is about 4.8. Bidding 4 3s is a reasonable and safe opening bid, as it leverages my two 3s and is likely to be met by at least two more 3s among the other 40 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. My hand contains one 3, and the expected number of 3s across 48 digits is 4.8, making the bid likely valid. Challenging risks elimination if the bid is true. Bidding 4 4s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, leveraging the higher digit (4 vs. 3) and my single 4 in hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have the hand 10961148, which contains one 0. The current bid is '1 0s' made by Player 2, which is very low and conservative. Given that there are 5 active players with 8 digits each (40 total digits), and I already have one 0 in my hand, it's very likely there are more 0s among other players. I could safely bid higher on 0s, or I could switch to another digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, which gives me confidence to bid on 1s. Since the current bid is so low, I'll make a reasonable increase while staying conservative.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I don't have any 1s in my hand. I can increase the bid to 4 2s, which is a safe increase and doesn't rely on me having any 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. With 32 unknown digits and an expected ~3.2 more 4s, the chance of at least 3 unknown 4s plus mine reaching 4 is around 60%. Challenging 4 2s (~60% chance true) is too risky, so I’ll minimally raise to 4 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 4s in my hand. For there to be at least four 4s among the other 32 digits is only about a 40% chance, making the bid unlikely to hold. It’s better to challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (10961148), I have one 4 in it. Player 2 has bid 3 4s, meaning they believe there are at least 3 fours among all players. With 32 total digits remaining across 4 players (8 digits each), and knowing I have one 4, there would need to be at least 2 more 4s among the other three players for this bid to be valid. This is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's risky given the moderate bid level. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 1s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 1s, but I'll choose a safer option by bidding 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand, and I only need 2 more 6s among the other players for this to be valid, which seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. I could bid 3 7s, which is a valid higher bid. However, since I have two 6s, it's more likely than not that there are at least 3 6s in total. Bidding higher than 3 6s based on just my hand seems risky, and challenging is also risky since I know there are at least two 6s. Since I have two 6s, bidding 4 0s or higher seems like a better strategy than challenging immediately, as it increases the bid significantly and forces others to make a harder decision.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 0s in my hand and only 24 cards remain among other players. The probability of seeing at least 4 zeros in those cards is under 25%, so Player 4’s bid of 4 0s is unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (10961148), I have one 4 in it. Player 2 has bid '3 4s', meaning they believe there are at least 3 fours among all players. Since I have 1 four, there would need to be at least 2 more fours between Player 0 and Player 2 for this bid to be valid. This is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's risky given the reasonable nature of the bid. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 1s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 1s, but that would require a quantity of at least 4 to be higher than '3 4s'. I also see I have one 6, one 9, and one 8 in my hand. I'll bid '3 6s', which is higher than '3 4s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity. This is a conservative but strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold one 7, so moving from 3 6s to 3 7s only requires two more 7s among the other 16 unknown digits (≈48% chance). This is the smallest legal raise and keeps the bid plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. In my hand (10961148), I have two 8s. The current bid is '3 8s', which means Player 2 is claiming there are at least 3 eights among all players. Since I already have 2 eights, this bid requires only 1 more eight between Player 0 and Player 2, which seems quite reasonable. Given this, challenging would be risky. My options for bidding higher are: increase the quantity to 4 (of any digit), or keep the quantity at 3 but bid a 9. Looking at my hand, I have one 9, so bidding '3 9s' would require 2 more nines between the other players, which is possible but not guaranteed. Alternatively, I could bid '4 0s', '4 1s', etc. I have one 0 and two 1s in my hand, so '4 1s' would require only 2 more ones from other players, which seems reasonable. I'll go with '4 1s' as it leverages my hand strength.

Player 0 Reasoning: I hold only one ‘1’, so to make 4 ‘1’s, the other 16 unknown digits must contain at least three ‘1’s. The chance of that is low (around 20%), making the bid unlikely. I should call the bluff.

Player 3 Reasoning: This is the final round with just two players - myself (Player 3) and Player 2. Each of us has 8 digits, for a total of 16 digits in play. Looking at my hand (10961148), I have: two 1s, one 0, one 9, one 6, one 4, and two 8s. Since I'm starting the bidding, I should make a strategic first bid. I want to bid on a digit I have multiple of, which gives me options of 1s or 8s (I have two of each). Bidding on 1s would be '2 1s', meaning I believe there are at least 2 ones total, which I know is true since I have two myself. This is a safe opening bid that leaves room for escalation later.

Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (10961148), I have two 1s but no 2s. Player 2 has bid '2 2s', which means they believe there are at least 2 twos between our hands. Since I have no 2s in my hand, all of those 2s would have to be in Player 2's hand. This is certainly possible, but I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge. I could bid '2 3s' (I have no 3s), '2 4s' (I have one 4), '2 5s' (I have no 5s), '2 6s' (I have one 6), or increase the quantity. Since I have two 1s in my hand, I know there are at least that many 1s total. I also have one 4, one 6, and two 8s in my hand. I'll bid '2 4s' since I know I have one 4 in my hand, and it's reasonable that Player 2 might have at least one more 4 in their hand.
