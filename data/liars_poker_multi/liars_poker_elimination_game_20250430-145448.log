Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 50250453, which has two 5s, two 0s, two 4s, one 2, and one 3. Starting with a conservative bid based on my strongest digit count, I will bid on 5s. A bid of 3 5s seems reasonable as I already have two in my hand, and with 48 total digits across 6 players, it's plausible that at least one more 5 exists among the other 40 digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I don't have any 5s in my hand, but I also don't have enough information to confidently challenge. I will make a slightly higher bid. Bidding 3 6s is a safe move since it only increases the digit and not the quantity, minimizing risk.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. My hand is 09803186, which contains two 8s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is strongly supported by my hand, requiring only one additional 8 from the remaining 5 players (40 digits). This seems very likely. Challenging 3 6s is too risky as it's a relatively low bid and I have one 6 myself. Bidding 3 8s is a safe and strategic move based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I hold two 6s. To satisfy a bid of 4 6s, only two more 6s are needed among the 40 unseen digits. With an expected 4 sixes in those 40 cards (10% of 40), the probability that there are at least two more is roughly 92%. This is a comfortably safe bid that also increases the quantity, putting pressure on later players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 6s and my hand containing 11325772, I notice I have one 6. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 players, each with 8 digits, the bid of 4 6s seems plausible but not extremely high. Since I need to make a strictly higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or the digit. Given that increasing the digit might be risky without knowing the exact distribution of higher digits among other players, a safer bet would be to increase the quantity of the same digit or move to a higher digit with the same quantity. However, without more information about the distribution of digits in other players' hands, challenging or making a significantly higher bid could be risky. The presence of a 7 in my hand suggests that bidding on 7s could be a viable strategy, but I must ensure the bid is higher than the current one. Thus, bidding on 7s with a quantity of 4 or more would be a higher bid. Since I have one 7 and considering the distribution could favor higher numbers given the bids so far, I will choose to bid on 7s, aiming for a quantity that is reasonable given the total digits and the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (81966147). This means only three more 7s are needed among the other 40 digits (5 players * 8 digits). The expected number of any digit is 4.8 (48 total digits / 10 possible digits). Therefore, 4 7s is a very plausible bid, slightly below the statistical average, making a challenge risky. I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 6s. Player 1 previously bid 3 6s and Player 3 bid 4 6s, suggesting there might be a concentration of 6s. Combining my two 6s with the information from previous bids makes bidding 5 6s a reasonable step up from the current 4 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 50250453, which contains no 6s. The current bid is 5 6s by Player 5. With 48 total digits across 6 players, an average of 4.8 digits of any number is expected across all hands. A bid of 5 6s is slightly above average but still plausible. However, since I have no 6s in my hand, I’m inclined to think the total might be lower than 5. Looking at the bidding history, bids have been conservative, increasing slowly, which suggests players might be bluffing or have weak hands for 6s. I could challenge, but the risk is high as 5 6s is not an outrageous bid. Instead, I’ll make a slightly higher bid to test the waters. I’ll bid 5 7s, as it’s a higher digit with the same quantity, and I have no 7s in my hand, so I’m not overly committed to defending it if challenged.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. My hand contains zero 7s, making 6 7s slightly above average expectation for the other players (expected 4 from 40 digits). However, 6 7s is still a plausible bid (around 30-35% chance of being true). My hand contains two 8s. Bidding 6 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires 4 additional 8s from the other 5 players (40 digits). The expected number of 8s from 40 digits is 4, making 6 8s exactly the average expectation based on my hand. This is a solid, plausible bid (around 56-58% chance of being true from my perspective) and a safer move than challenging a bid that is not extremely unlikely, especially when I have a strong digit (8) to bid on.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:3 - o3-2025-04-16) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand. That means the other 40 hidden digits (5 players × 8) would need to supply all 6 eights. Under a uniform distribution the expected number of 8s in those 40 digits is only 4, and the chance of seeing 6 or more is roughly 15-20%. Even allowing for Player 2 possibly holding several 8s, the bid is still well above expectation, while any legal raise would have to jump to a quantity of 7, which would put me at greater risk. Challenging the current bid offers the best odds of success.

Player 3 Reasoning: I’m first to act this round. In my hand of eight digits I have two 4s (92044667). With 32 unseen digits spread among four opponents, the expected number of 4s in the rest of the table is about 3.2, making it very likely that there is at least one more 4 in play. Opening with the modest bid of 3 4s leverages my pair, is overwhelmingly safe against an immediate challenge (~97 % chance the total is ≥3), and keeps the quantity low so I’ll have room to maneuver as the bidding grows.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 4s and considering my hand contains a 4, I have some basis to believe there could be at least three 4s in total. However, with only 40 total digits remaining and my hand having just one 4, bidding higher might be risky. Since my hand doesn't provide strong evidence for a significantly higher bid and challenging could eliminate a player if the bid is unlikely, I must weigh the risks. Considering the bid history and the fact that players have been bidding relatively high, it seems that players might be trying to bluff or have strong hands. Given my single 4 and the total number of digits, I'm inclined to challenge the bid as it seems somewhat unlikely but not impossible. Challenging gives me a chance to eliminate a player if I'm correct, which could be strategically advantageous.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I’m the opening bidder this round. I hold two 6s (hand: 92044667). With 32 digits in play, the average count for any digit is about 3.2. If the other 24 hidden digits contain at least two more 6s—a roughly 70% likelihood—there will be 4 or more 6s overall. That makes a bid of 4 6s very plausible while still being strong enough that opponents are unlikely to challenge immediately. It also lets me build on a digit I already have multiples of for future raises.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (81966147). With 4 active players and 32 total digits, the expected average count for any digit is 3.2. The bid of 4 6s is slightly above average but quite plausible, especially since I hold two 6s myself. This means only two more 6s are needed from the other 24 digits held by the other three players. The expected number of 6s in those 24 digits is 2.4 (24 * 0.1). Challenging seems too risky as the bid is likely correct or very close. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 4 7s, 4 8s, 4 9s, or increasing the quantity to 5. I have two 1s and two 6s. Bidding 5 1s or 5 6s seems like the strongest option based on my hand. Bidding 5 6s directly increases the quantity on the current digit, leveraging my two 6s and putting pressure on the next player. It requires three more 6s from the remaining 24 digits, which is plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 50250453, which contains no 6s. The current bid is 5 6s by Player 5. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 5 6s means that on average, there should be about 1.25 6s per player. Since I have zero 6s, the other three players would need to have at least 5 6s among their 24 digits, which is roughly 1.67 6s per player. This is possible but seems on the higher side. However, looking at the bidding history, Player 3 bid 4 6s before Player 5 raised it to 5 6s, which suggests confidence in 6s. I am inclined to avoid a challenge due to the risk of elimination and instead make a safer bid. I’ll bid 5 7s, as it’s a minimal increase and I have no information about 7s in my hand to contradict it.

Player 3 Reasoning: I only hold one 7. That means the other three players would need to supply at least five more 7s for the bid of 6 7s to be true. In 24 random digits the chance of seeing five or more 7s is under 10%, and hands containing three or more 7s are very rare (≈4% each). Any legal raise (e.g., 6 8s or 7 x-s) would be even less plausible given my cards, so challenging offers the best chance of success.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s by Player 3. There are 3 players and 24 total digits. I have one 4 in my hand (81966147). This means Player 3's bid requires at least two more 4s among the 16 digits held by Player 0 and Player 3. The expected number of 4s in those 16 digits is 1.6 (16 * 0.1). So, needing two more is plausible, making a challenge risky. I should look for a safe higher bid. My hand contains two 1s and two 6s. A bid of 3 1s is not higher than 3 4s. A bid of 3 6s is higher. With two 6s in my hand, I only need one more 6 among the other 16 digits. The expected number of 6s in those digits is 1.6. Therefore, bidding 3 6s is statistically very likely to be true and is a safe, valid higher bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 50250453, which contains no 6s. The current bid is 3 6s by Player 5. With only 24 total digits across 3 players, and none of the 6s in my hand, I need to consider if 3 6s is plausible. Since I have no 6s, the 3 must be distributed among the other two players' 16 digits. This is possible (e.g., one player could have all 3), but I can make a safer bid instead of challenging. I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding 4 5s feels reasonable as it increases the quantity from 3 to 4 while switching to a digit I have some support for. However, since the current bid is 3 6s, I need to bid higher. I can bid 4 6s to increase the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 3 7s or higher, but since I have no 7s, I’ll stick with increasing the quantity to 4 6s to test the waters without overcommitting.

Instead, I’ll raise the quantity by one, staying on the digit I already have strength in. Moving to 5 6s is the minimal legal raise and still plausible given that any opponent who was already comfortable with 4 6s is unlikely to challenge immediately.

Player 5 Reasoning: I hold two 6s (81966147). The current bid is 5 6s by Player 3. Prior bids this round include my own 3 6s, Player 0's 4 6s, and now Player 3's 5 6s. This escalation suggests Player 0 and Player 3 likely hold some 6s. The actual total could plausibly be 4 (e.g., 2 me + 1 P0 + 1 P3) or 5 (e.g., 2 me + 2 P0 + 1 P3 or 2 me + 1 P0 + 2 P3). Challenging 5 6s is therefore risky. Bidding higher seems safer. The next logical bid following the pattern is 6 6s. This requires four more 6s among the 16 digits held by Player 0 and Player 3. Given the previous bids pushing 6s, this is plausible, although aggressive. It leverages my two 6s and puts the pressure on Player 0.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 50250453, which contains no 6s. The current bid is 6 6s by Player 5. With a total of 24 digits across all three players, a bid of 6 6s means that on average, each player would need to have 2 6s. Since I have none, the other two players would need to have a total of 6 6s between them (3 each on average). Looking at the bidding history, Player 5 raised from 5 6s to 6 6s, which might indicate confidence, but it still seems risky given I have zero 6s. The probability of the other two players having 6 6s combined (out of their 16 digits) is low, as it would require a very specific distribution. I think it's more likely that the bid is a bluff, so I will challenge.
