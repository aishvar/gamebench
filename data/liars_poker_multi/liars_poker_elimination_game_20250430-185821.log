Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I have the opportunity to set the tone. My hand has two 7s, two 9s, and two 2s. A bid of 2 7s is a safe starting point, reflecting a digit where I have a pair. It's a low bid, allowing for plenty of room for subsequent bids.

Player 1 Reasoning: I hold three 8s, guaranteeing at least 3 eights across all hands. Raising the bid from 2 7s to 3 8s is strictly higher and completely safe given my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have four 6s in my hand, which already satisfies the quantity needed for a bid of 4 6s. This bid is truthful and strictly higher than the current bid of 3 8s. It leverages my strong holding in 6s while avoiding unnecessary risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s, which is close to the expected average count for a digit across 6 players (4.8). Challenging this bid is risky without more information. My hand contains three 4s. Bidding 5 4s is a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity. This bid seems plausible, as it only requires 2 more 4s from the remaining 5 players (40 digits), which is a reasonable expectation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge Player 3's bid of '5 4s'. Looking at my hand (89024136), I have one 4. With 6 players total and 8 digits per player, there are 48 total digits in play. For Player 3's bid to be valid, there need to be at least 5 fours among all players. I already account for 1 of those, so there would need to be at least 4 more fours among the other 5 players, which is certainly possible. The bidding has been relatively conservative so far, increasing gradually from 2 to 5, which suggests players are being cautious. I could bid '5 5s' (same quantity, higher digit), '5 6s', or higher. Since I have one 6 in my hand, bidding '5 6s' seems reasonable - I'm accounting for 1, and need 4 more among 5 other players, which is plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 5 6s would be the same as the current bid, so I'll increase the quantity to 6 while keeping the digit the same, as I have no reason to believe there are more 6s than 7s or 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 7s and two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 6 6s. I can bid 6 7s, which is higher than 6 6s and uses a digit I have multiple of. Alternatively, I could bid higher on 6s, but I don't have any 6s. Bidding 6 7s seems like a reasonable increase based on my hand and the number of players still in the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 7s in my hand. With 40 unknown digits and p≈0.1 per digit, the expected number of 7s among the others is about 4, and the probability of at least 6 is only around 20%. A bid of 6 7s is unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: It's the start of a new round and I am the first bidder. I have three 7s and two 9s in my hand. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count per digit is 4. A bid of 3 7s is a safe starting bid based on my hand and the number of players.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have four 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 4 6s increases the quantity and leverages my strong holding in 6s, making it a reasonable and valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand contains three 4s, one 6, and two 7s. With 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. Bidding 4 6s is the average expectation. I have one 6, so it's possible the actual count is 4 or more. Challenging is risky. Bidding higher is the better option. My hand is strongest in 4s (three of them). Bidding 5 4s is a strong, well-supported bid that increases the quantity from the current bid of 4. This leverages my hand effectively and is a reasonable increase in the bid level.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge Player 3's bid of 5 4s. Looking at my hand (89024136), I have one 4. For Player 3's bid to be valid, there need to be at least 4 more 4s among the other players' hands. With 5 players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. If digits were evenly distributed, we'd expect about 4 of each digit (40 digits ÷ 10 possible digits). Since I have one 4, and we need 5 total, that means 4 out of the remaining 32 digits in other players' hands need to be 4s. This is reasonable and not worth challenging. For my bid, I could go to 5 6s (I have one 6), 5 8s (I have one 8), 5 9s (I have one 9), or increase the quantity to 6 with a lower digit. Since I have one 6, one 8, and one 9 in my hand, bidding 6 0s seems reasonable as I have one 0 myself.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have a 6 in my hand. The current bid of 6 0s by Player 4 is not relevant to me, but the bids of other players are. Player 0 bid 3 7s, which is lower quantity and digit than Player 2's 4 6s. I should bid higher quantity and digit, making 4 6s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have four 6s in my hand. Bidding 4 6s is a logical choice since the total quantity of 6s across all players must be at least 4, making this bid truthful. This bid is higher than the current bid of 3 7s as it increases the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand contains three 4s. Bidding 5 4s is a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity. With three 4s in my hand, bidding 5 4s requires only two additional 4s from the remaining 24 digits across 3 players, which is a plausible expectation (average 2.4 per 24 digits). Challenging the bid of 4 6s seems risky given Player 2's history of bidding 4 6s, suggesting they likely hold multiple 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (89024136), I have one 4 in it. The current bid is 5 4s across all 32 digits. To estimate if this is reasonable, I need to consider probability. With 32 total digits and 10 possible values (0-9), we'd expect about 3.2 of each digit on average. Since I have one 4, there would need to be at least 4 more 4s among the other players' hands to make the bid valid. This is possible but starting to get less likely. However, I don't think it's unlikely enough to challenge yet. I should make a higher bid. I have one 6 in my hand, which gives me some confidence. I could bid 5 5s (same quantity, higher digit) or 6 4s (higher quantity, same digit). Since I don't have any 5s in my hand, I'll go with 6 4s, which forces the next player to either bid at least 6 of a higher digit or 7 of any digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains three 7s and two 9s. The current bid is 6 4s. With 32 total digits, the expected count for any digit is around 3.2 (32/10). A bid of 6 4s is already quite high relative to the expected value. Given my hand, I could potentially bid 7 7s based on my three 7s, but that's a significant jump. Bidding 7 4s is also an option but I have no 4s. Bidding on 9s is less likely to be supported by other players. Challenging 6 4s seems reasonable as it's a high bid, but I don't have strong evidence it's false. Bidding 7 7s is a plausible move given my hand strength in 7s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid of 7 7s requires at least seven 7s in the remaining 32 digits. With an average of 3.2 occurrences per digit across all hands and only one 7 in my hand, achieving seven total 7s seems statistically unlikely. Player 0's previous bid of 6 7s was exactly met, but increasing to 7 appears risky given the low probability of exceeding the average. Challenging this bid is a calculated risk based on distribution expectations.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s by Player 2. There are 24 total digits remaining. I have one 6 in my hand. For the bid to be true, there must be at least 4 more 6s among the remaining 16 digits held by Player 2 and Player 4. The probability of having 4 or more of a specific digit in 16 random digits is relatively low (~7%). While Player 2 likely has some 6s, this bid seems aggressive. My hand doesn't strongly support a significantly higher bid (e.g., bidding 6 4s based on my three 4s or 5 7s based on my two 7s would also require a high count from others). Challenging the aggressive bid appears to be the most strategic move.

Player 4 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 2's bid of 5 6s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (89024136), I have only 1 six. For Player 2's bid to be valid, there need to be at least 5 sixes total between our hands. Since I have 1 six, Player 2 would need to have at least 4 sixes in their hand. While possible, having 4 of the same digit in an 8-digit hand is somewhat unlikely (probability around 1.4%). Also, Player 2 has consistently bid on 6s across multiple rounds, which might be a bluff strategy. Given that I only have 1 six and Player 2 would need 4 sixes (half their hand), I think challenging is the better option here.
