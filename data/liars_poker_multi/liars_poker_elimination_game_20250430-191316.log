Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no previous bids have been made, I can start by bidding a modest but plausible amount based on my hand. I have the digits 3, 9, 4, 4, 6, 3, 4, 1. Counting the digits: 3 appears 2 times, 4 appears 3 times, 6 once, 9 once, 1 once. The total counts are: 1s:1, 3s:2, 4s:3, 6:1, 9:1. To be safe, I will bid '3 4s', which is within the total possible count, and slightly conservative to avoid an easy challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s. By bidding 4 7s, I use my two 7s and need only two more among the other 40 cards. With each digit expected ~4.8 times, the probability of at least 4 total 7s is over 90%, making this a safe raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 7s and two 8s in my hand. To meet the current bid of 4 7s I’d need at least two more 7s among the 40 unknown digits; that has about a 92% chance (Binomial(40,0.1) P≥2). Rather than raising the quantity, I can bid the same quantity with a higher digit: 4 8s. I have two 8s, so I need two more in the unknowns—again about a 92% chance. This is safer than jumping to five of any digit. Therefore I’ll bid 4 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. Player 2 claims there are at least 4 8s. Given I can only see one 8 in my hand, and 4 8s would represent a reasonable portion of possible 8s, I can make a slightly higher bid. Since I also have two 9s in my hand, bidding 4 9s is a strategic move - it's the minimum valid raise and I have evidence to support it.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 4 9s, which means there would need to be at least three more 9s among the other five players' hands (total of 40 digits). Given that 9s are less common digits, this seems unlikely. I should challenge the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand and just won a challenge on 4 9s last round, proving there are at least 6 9s total. Since I'm starting this round and know there are multiple 9s, starting with a conservative bid of 3 9s is a safe play. This leaves room for escalation while leveraging known information about 9s distribution.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and have a strong hand with one 9. In previous rounds, I successfully bid on 9s and won challenges, suggesting there might still be several 9s in play. Starting with a conservative bid of 3 9s is reasonable - it worked before, and even if other players lost some 9s between rounds, I know there's at least one (mine), making this a relatively safe opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:5 - gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 3, 9, 4, 4, 6, 3, 4, 1. Counting the 9s, I have at least one 9, but likely fewer than 3. The current bid is 3 9s, which is close to my maximum possible count for 9s, but I only have one. Challenging now makes sense because the total number of 9s across all players is unlikely to be 3 or more, given my limited number of 9s and the previous bids. Bidding higher on 9s isn't feasible since I only have one, and increasing the quantity or digit isn't justified. Therefore, challenging is the best move.

Player 3 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and have a strong hand with two 9s. In previous rounds, I've successfully bid and won with 9s multiple times. With 24 total digits and 3 players, starting with a conservative bid of 3 9s is reasonable - I already know where 2 of them are, and only need 1 more among 16 other digits to be safe.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have only one 9 in my hand and there are 16 unknown digits. The expected number of 9s among them is 1.6, and the probability of at least two more 9s (to make three total) is only about 48%. It’s slightly more likely that Player 3’s bid of 3 9s is false. I should challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand and have been successful bidding 9s in previous rounds. With 16 total digits and 8 per player, starting with a conservative bid of 2 9s is reasonable, as I already know about one and there's a good chance Player 2 has at least one more.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. To make a bid of 3 7s I only need one more from the opponent, which has about a 57% chance given 8 unknown cards. Challenging the current bid of 2 9s would only win roughly 43% of the time since I only hold one 9. It's more favorable to raise to 3 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand of 10928945, I have one 7. For Player 2's bid of '3 7s' to be true, they would need to have at least two 7s in their hand. While possible, this seems unlikely given my hand. Additionally, I've shown strength with 9s in previous rounds, consistently winning challenges. Since there are only 16 total digits remaining and I can see my own hand contains just one 7, the probability of Player 2 having exactly two or more 7s in their eight digits is relatively low. A challenge here is the safer play.
