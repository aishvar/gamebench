Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I’m the opening bidder. I already have two 7s, and with 48 total digits the average count of any single digit is about 5. The chance that there are at least two more 7s among the other 40 hidden digits is very high (around 90%), so a bid of 4 7s is safe while still giving me some leverage for future raises.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 7s' by Player 0, I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Since I have the digits 5, 2, 6, 5, 0, 6, 3, and 3 in my hand, and none of them are 7s, I don't have direct information to assess the likelihood of '4 7s'. However, considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 players, the average number of any single digit across all players would be 8 (since 48/6 = 8), which makes the bid of '4 7s' plausible but not extremely high. To make a higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or the digit value. Given that I have two 6s and two 5s, but no 7s or higher, bidding on a higher digit seems risky without more information. Thus, considering the balance and aiming to stay in the game without taking too much risk, I could consider bidding on a digit I have, like the 6, but I must increase the quantity to make it a valid higher bid. Since I don't have enough information to comfortably challenge '4 7s' and given the constraints, a reasonable approach might be to bid on a digit I have knowledge of, but given the rules, I must strictly increase the bid, which means either bidding a higher quantity of 7s or the same quantity of a higher digit. Given these considerations and the fact that bidding on a digit I have more of (like 6) but with a higher quantity could be risky without knowing others' hands, the safest increase would be to match the quantity and increase the digit, but since I don't have an 8 or 9 to bid on with confidence, and increasing quantity without direct evidence is risky, challenging might be the safer option if the current bid seems unlikely. However, without a clear indication that '4 7s' is unlikely and considering I don't want to risk being wrong, making a bid that is reasonably higher and based on what I know seems prudent. Given the current bid and my hand, I must think about what could reasonably come next that I could support or challenge effectively.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 5 6s, which is plausible but risky. I could bid 6 5s, increasing the digit but keeping the quantity low. However, challenging might be a better strategy since the current bid is pushing the limits of what's likely with only 48 digits remaining and 6 players. I'll challenge the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 52650633, I have three 6s and other digits. Since I have to make a bid that is strictly higher than 'None', I can start by bidding on the digit I have the most of, which is the 6. Bidding 3 6s seems like a safe start because it's based on the information I have from my own hand, and it allows for the possibility that other players may also have 6s, potentially making the bid valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 55926987, which contains one 6. The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 1. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, an average of 4 digits per digit value across all hands is expected if distribution is uniform. A bid of 3 6s is quite low and likely to be true since it's below the average. I don't have a strong reason to challenge as my single 6 contributes to the count, and it's plausible others have at least two more 6s. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 3 6s, I can bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 4 6s feels risky with only one 6 in my hand, so I'll bid 3 7s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, as I also have one 7 which gives me some confidence.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have three 8s and two 0s in my hand. With 5 players and 8 digits each, the average count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4.  A bid of 3 7s is below average, and I have no 7s.  However, I have three 8s. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable increase based on my hand and the average distribution, and it's a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. There are 5 players and 40 total digits. The expected number of any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. My hand is 77281783. I have two 8s. This means only 2 more 8s are needed among the other 4 players (32 digits) for the current bid to be true. The expected number of 8s among those 32 digits is 3.2. Therefore, the bid of 4 8s is quite plausible, and challenging it seems risky. I should make a higher bid. Possible higher bids are 4 9s or increasing the quantity to 5. I have three 7s in my hand. Bidding 5 7s requires only 2 more 7s among the remaining 32 digits (expected 3.2). This is statistically well-supported by my hand, even though Player 3 previously bid 3 7s. Bidding 5 8s (requiring 3 more 8s from 32) is also possible given my two 8s, but 5 7s feels stronger due to holding 3 of the required 5.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I can see two 7s in my own hand. Challenging 5 7s would be dangerous because I’d only need three more 7s among the other 32 hidden digits for that bid to be correct, which is quite likely. Instead, I’ll raise the quantity while staying on the digit I’m strongest in. Bidding 6 7s means I still rely on my two 7s, so the table needs just four more 7s among 32 unknown digits—something that occurs roughly 40 % of the time. This is a safer move than switching to a different digit or challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 6 7s, I must decide whether to bid higher or challenge. With my hand being 52650633, I have no 7s, which makes it difficult for me to assess the likelihood of the current bid being true. However, considering the total digits remaining are 40 and there are 5 players, the maximum number of any digit can be is 40. Since the bid is for 6 7s, it's plausible but challenging to determine its validity without more information. Given that I have multiple 6s and 3s in my hand, and considering the previous bids and the game's progression, I should consider bidding on a digit I have knowledge of. However, since the current bid is high and on a specific digit (7s), and I don't have any 7s, challenging seems like a viable option, especially since the previous challenge resulted in a win for the bidder, indicating players might be bidding strategically rather than randomly. But, I must also consider that bidding on a digit I have more information about could be beneficial. Given my hand and the need to bid higher, I could consider bidding on 6s, but the quantity must be higher than the current bid's quantity or the digit must be higher if the quantity remains the same. Since I have two 6s and considering previous bids, increasing the quantity of 6s seems less feasible without more information on other players' hands. Thus, challenging the current bid might be the safer option, considering I have no 7s and the bid quantity is already high.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. With 32 total digits in play, the other 24 cards are expected to contain about 2–3 more 7s, giving an overall expectation of roughly 4–5 sevens. Opening with 4 7s uses the strongest digit in my hand, is statistically likely to be true if I’m challenged, and sets a reasonable starting point for the round.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 55926987, which contains two 7s. The current bid is 4 7s by Player 0. With 32 total digits across 4 players, it's plausible that there are at least two more 7s among the other players' hands, making the total of 4 7s possible. However, I need to make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity to 5 7s or bid on a higher digit with at least 4 as the quantity. Given that I have two 9s in my hand, bidding 4 9s might be a safer move since it's a higher digit and I have some support for it in my hand. This also avoids pushing the quantity too high on 7s, which might invite a challenge. I'll go with 4 9s to test the waters and see if others believe there are enough 9s in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand. With 4 players and 32 total digits, the average count for any digit is 3.2. A bid of 4 9s is slightly above average but not extremely high, especially since I know I have none. However, increasing the bid to 5 of any digit or 4 of a higher digit (which doesn't exist) feels risky given my hand doesn't strongly support higher bids on other digits. Given the current bid and my hand, challenging seems like a reasonable option to potentially eliminate a player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 4. I hold two 8s in my hand (77281783). This means that for the bid of 3 8s to be true, only one more 8 needs to exist among the 16 digits held by Player 0 and Player 4. This is highly probable (expected number of 8s in 16 digits is 1.6). Therefore, challenging the bid is very risky and likely to result in my elimination. I should make a higher bid. I can bid 3 9s or increase the quantity to 4. Since I have two 8s, bidding 4 8s is a credible and relatively safe increase. It leverages my hand and builds directly on the previous bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 8s at all in my eight-digit hand. That means all four (or more) 8s required by the current bid would have to be packed into the 16 digits held by Players 4 and 5. Randomly, the chance of seeing 4 + eights in just 16 digits is under 10 %. Even allowing for the fact that both opponents seem to hold some 8s (because they have been bidding them), getting to four still feels less than 50 % likely, and any further bid I make would be even riskier – I’d be forced to claim quantities I consider even less probable with no useful information advantage. Therefore the best play is to challenge the current bid of 4 8s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am Player 5 and I need to make the opening bid in this heads-up round against Player 4. There are 16 total digits (8 in my hand, 8 in Player 4's). My hand is 77281783, containing three 7s and two 8s. The statistically expected number of any digit across all 16 is 1.6. My three 7s represent a strong holding. The expected total number of 7s is 3 (my hand) + 0.8 (expected in Player 4's hand) = 3.8. Therefore, a bid of '3 7s' is extremely safe. A bid of '4 7s' requires Player 4 to have at least one 7, which is statistically probable. Given my strong holding of 7s, opening with '4 7s' is a confident but likely safe bid that leverages my hand information.

With 16 total digits, 4 7s is slightly less than the expected average of 1.6 7s per player (16 total digits / 10 digits = 1.6 average per digit type), meaning it's possible but not highly likely. However, given my strong hand in 8s, I can confidently bid higher with 8s. Bidding 5 8s is a strong bid based on my three 8s, and it's a valid higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s made by Player 4. I have two 8s in my hand (77281783). For Player 4's bid to be true, they need to hold at least three 8s out of their eight digits. Given Player 4's previous bids on 8s (3 8s, 4 8s in prior rounds, and now 5 8s), it's plausible they have at least three 8s, making a challenge risky. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 5 9s or any bid with quantity 6 or more. I have three 7s in my hand. Bidding 6 7s is a strong possibility. This requires Player 4 to have at least three 7s. Given my previous bid was 4 7s, Player 4 might expect me to have several 7s. Bidding 6 7s leverages my hand's strength and puts the pressure back on Player 4. Bidding 6 8s would require Player 4 to have four 8s, which is riskier than bidding on my own strong suit. Bidding 5 9s or 6 of other digits where I have few is too speculative.
