Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. Bidding 2 2s is a safe bid since the total count across all players must be at least two (my own). This bid is strictly higher than the current bid of 1 0s by increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. Player 1 has bid '2 2s', claiming there are at least 2 twos among all players' hands. Looking at my own hand (48089503), I don't have any 2s. This means all the 2s would need to come from the other 5 players. Is this reasonable? With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 other digits I don't see. The probability of finding at least 2 twos in 40 random digits is quite high. Since I don't have any 2s to support raising on that digit, I should either bid on a different digit or raise the quantity. I have one 0, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 8, and one 9 in my hand. I could bid '2 3s' (raising the digit) or '3 0s' (raising the quantity). Since I have a 0 in my hand and Player 0 already bid on 0s, bidding '3 0s' seems reasonable as there's likely at least 2 more 0s among other players.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I don't have any 0s, but I also don't have enough information to confidently challenge. I will make a slightly higher bid to gather more information: 3 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 1s, which I can surpass by increasing the quantity to 4 and using a higher digit (6). This leverages my strong holdings in 6s while making a plausible bid that challenges opponents to either match or call me out.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand has one 8. The current bid is 4 6s, and I need to raise. Bidding 4 8s means I need at least three more 8s among the other 40 digits. The probability of seeing ≥3 out of 40 with p=0.1 is about 78%, making it the safest minimal increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding 5 3s increases the quantity from the current bid of 4 9s. Since I have two 3s, it's plausible that there are at least 5 total, so this bid is reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (48089503), I have one 3 in it. The current bid is 5 3s across all players. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. If I have one 3, that means there need to be at least 4 more 3s among the other 5 players' hands. That's less than 1 per player on average, which is quite reasonable. I could bid higher, but I don't have strong evidence to support a much higher bid. Since I have one 8 in my hand, and I see Player 5 previously bid 4 8s, I could bid 5 8s. This is a safe increase that's supported by my own hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 6 8s seems like a reasonable increase, and it's likely there are at least five more 8s among the other players.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:3 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. My hand has no 8s, and with 40 remaining digits across 5 players, the expected number of 8s is 4. A bid of 6 8s exceeds this average significantly. The probability of 6 or more 8s being present is low (~18%), making a challenge strategically advantageous. Bidding higher (e.g., 6 9s) would also be speculative, but challenging offers a higher chance of success based on statistical likelihood.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: As the first bid in the round, I need to establish a reasonable starting point based on my hand. My hand contains three 6s, which is the highest count of any single digit. Bidding 4 6s is plausible since I have three, and assuming at least one other player has a 6. This is a cautious yet strategic opening bid that leverages my strong digit count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. There are 32 unknown digits among the other players and we expect about 3.2 more 6s (32×0.1), so a total of about 5.2 sixes. Challenging 4 6s is too risky, so I should raise the quantity to 5 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. With 40 total digits across 5 players, the expected count for any digit (including 7s) is around 4. The current bid of 5 7s is slightly above this average. Given my limited 7s and the statistical unlikelihood of reaching 5 total 7s, challenging seems favorable to eliminate Player 0.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Since there are 32 total digits across 4 players and the previous 4-player round started with a bid of 4 6s, bidding 4 3s is a reasonable starting bid based on my hand and the game's progression.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. In my hand (48089503), I have one 3, which means there are at least that many in play. Player 1 has bid 4 3s, suggesting there are at least 4 threes among all players. With 32 total digits remaining and 4 active players, this is certainly possible. Looking at my options: I could increase the quantity to 5 3s, but that's risky without knowing how many 3s others have. I could keep the quantity at 4 but increase the digit (e.g., 4 4s, 4 5s, etc.). Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 8, and one 9. The safest option is to bid on a digit I have multiple of, so 4 0s would be reasonable. However, I could also bid 4 5s or 4 8s since I have those digits in my hand. Since I have one 8 and the previous rounds showed there were at least 5 8s in an earlier round (when more players were active), 4 8s seems like a safe bid.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:3 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains no 8s, and the current bid is 4 8s. With 32 total digits and 4 players, the expected number of 8s is 3.2 (32 * 0.1). However, since I have none, the remaining 24 digits would average 2.4 8s. Bidding higher (e.g., 5 8s or 4 9s) risks overestimating scarce digits. Challenging is optimal if the bid is likely false, as the probability of ≥4 8s in 24 digits is low (~30%+ based on binomial distribution).
