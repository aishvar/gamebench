Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 58251670, which contains a variety of digits. I have a total of 2 fives and 1 eight. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but not too low. Bidding on a digit that I have seen can be a good strategy. I will bid on '3 5s' as it is a moderate quantity and I have seen two 5s in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s, which requires at least three 5s in total. With 48 total digits across six players and a uniform distribution expectation (~4.8 total 5s on average), the bid is conservative. Given my two 5s, the actual count likely exceeds 3, so raising to 4 5s aligns with statistical probability and leverages my hand strength.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand, so the bid could be plausible. To continue the game, I can increase the digit to a higher value. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 4 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This leverages my existing 7s while raising the stakes.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Challenging 4 8s is risky because, with 48 total digits, the expected number of any digit is about 4.8, so 4 8s is very plausible. I hold two 4s in my own hand, giving me solid information about that digit. By bidding 5 4s I only need at least three more 4s among the 40 unseen digits; the expectation for those players is roughly four 4s, making my bid statistically favorable while still legally higher (greater quantity) than the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s, meaning at least five 4s exist among all players. I have one 4 in my hand. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can increase the digit at the same quantity or increase the quantity. I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding 5 8s is a reasonable next bid, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This bid is plausible given my hand and the previous bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 48 total digits and 6 players, a bid of 5 8s implies an average of less than one 8 per player. Given that I have one 8, it's plausible others have more. However, increasing the quantity to 6 or more seems risky. I can bid 5 9s, keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit, which is a safer move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid of 5 9s requires at least 5 nines in total across all hands. My hand contains no 9s, and the expected number of 9s in all hands (based on uniform distribution) is 4.8. Since I have none, the remaining 40 digits must contain all 9s, which averages 4.8. This makes the bid slightly above the expected count. Given the high risk of a 6+ bid (average per digit is ~4.8) and the statistical unlikelihood of 5 9s being valid, challenging is the optimal move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started with 5 active players, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 58251670, which contains a variety of digits. I see that I have two 5s, which is a moderate count for my hand. A reasonable starting bid could be around the average count of a digit. Since there are 40 digits in total, the average count for any digit is 4. I will bid 4 5s as it seems like a safe and reasonable starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains two 7s, one 5, and other digits. The current bid is 4 5s. Bidding 4 7s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, leveraging my two 7s. This is plausible as the total digits remaining (40) allow for sufficient 7s across other players' hands. Challenging 4 5s risks elimination since the expected count of 5s (4.2) is near the bid threshold, making it likely valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Challenging 4 8s feels risky. I only have one 8, but with 32 unseen digits it’s better than even money that there are at least three more. Instead, I can make a small, legal raise. I hold one 9 and in the last round there were 6 total 9s among 48 digits, so 9s seem plentiful. With only 8 cards gone, it’s quite plausible there are still at least four 9s in the 40 digits. Raising the digit while keeping the quantity the same puts pressure on the next player without over-extending.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I must bid higher either by increasing the quantity or by increasing the digit with the same quantity. I have one 9 in my hand, but only one. Since the current quantity is 4, I can bid 5 0s, which is a higher quantity. Given that zeros are common and I have one zero, bidding 5 0s is a reasonable step up and likely believable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand (58251670). With 5 players remaining and 8 digits each, the total count of 0s across all hands is likely to be around 5 (since 8*5=40 and the distribution is random). My hand has one 0, so the remaining 4 players must have 4 0s in total. It's plausible. However, I can bid higher by increasing the digit. I will bid 5 1s. There's a possibility that the count of 1s could be higher or around 5.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:1 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. My hand contains one 1, and with 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. Bidding 5 1s is on the edge, and challenging could eliminate Player 0 if the actual count is less than 5. Given the previous challenge outcome (5 9s was correct), but 1s are more common, I suspect the bid is unlikely. Challenging is the optimal move.

Player 2 Reasoning: As the first to bid, I need to set a reasonable starting point. My hand contains two 7s and two 9s. Bidding 3 7s is plausible since I have two, and there's a good chance at least one more exists in the remaining hands. This balances safety and allows for escalation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. Challenging would succeed only if there are fewer than 3 eights among the 32 digits. I already hold one 8, so only two more are needed among 24 unknown digits—roughly a 70% chance that the bid is valid. Challenging is therefore risky. A safe, minimal raise is to keep the quantity at 3 but move up to the highest digit, 9. I hold one 9 myself, and the expected total of any digit in 32 digits is about 3.2, giving roughly a 70% chance there are at least three 9s. This meets the “higher” requirement while forcing later players to increase the quantity on their turns, which may draw a challenge toward them instead of me.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand (digit at position 7). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since the maximum digit is 9, I cannot increase the digit at the same quantity. Therefore, I must increase the quantity to 4 and can bid any digit from 0 to 9. I have two 8s in my hand, which makes bidding 4 8s reasonable because it's a higher quantity and a digit I hold relatively frequently. This bid is a valid and reasonable step up from 3 9s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand, so three more are needed across the other 24 digits. While possible, the probability is moderate. Bidding 4 9s leverages my two 9s and requires only two additional 9s in the remaining digits, which is more plausible given the expected distribution. This maintains pressure without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I hold one 8. Earlier in this very round Player 5 confidently bid 4 8s, which strongly suggests they possess several 8s themselves. If they have just three and I have one, we already total four 8s, needing only a single additional 8 among the remaining 16 hidden digits of Players 2 and 3 to reach five—a likelihood of roughly 80 %. Increasing the digit from 0 to 8 while keeping the quantity at 5 is therefore a credible, safe way to beat the current bid and shifts the next decision to Player 5.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s by Player 4. I have two 8s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 5 and increase the digit. The next higher bid after 5 8s is 5 9s or 6 0s. Since 5 9s was previously challenged and found to be valid with 6 actual digits, bidding 5 9s again seems reasonable. However, I want to be more aggressive and increase the quantity to 6, starting with the lowest digit 0. I have one 0 in my hand, which adds some confidence to this bid. Therefore, I will bid 6 0s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s by Player 5. My hand contains no 0s, and the remaining 24 digits across three players would need to contain 6 0s for the bid to be valid. Given the low probability of 6 zeros in 24 digits (expected value ~2.4), this bid is highly unlikely. Challenging is the optimal move.

Player 2 Reasoning: As the starting player with two 7s in my hand, bidding 3 7s is a reasonable opening move.
