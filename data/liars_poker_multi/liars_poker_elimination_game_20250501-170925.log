Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. I have three 8s (positions 1, 2, and 7), so at least three 8s are possible. Bidding '3 8s' seems reasonable to open the bidding, as it reflects my hand and is a safe starting point without risking an immediate challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 93274928, which contains two 8s. The current bid is 3 8s by Player 0. Since I have two 8s myself, it's plausible that there is at least one more 8 among the other 40 digits across the remaining players. The probability of at least one 8 in 40 digits, assuming random distribution, is reasonably high. Therefore, challenging seems risky. Instead, I will make a higher bid. I can increase the quantity to 4 and stay with 8s, as my hand supports a strong presence of 8s. This bid is still plausible and forces the next player to either challenge or bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 1. Looking at my hand (50181464), I have one 8 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For the bid of 4 8s to be valid, there need to be at least 3 more 8s among the other 5 players (since I have 1). This is certainly possible. If the digits were evenly distributed, we'd expect about 4.8 of each digit (48 total digits ÷ 10 possible digits). So having 4 or more 8s total is reasonable. I could bid higher, either by increasing the quantity to 5 or keeping the quantity at 4 but choosing a higher digit (9). Since I don't have any 9s in my hand, I'll go with 5 8s, which is a reasonable escalation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I hold only one 8, so challenging the bid of 5 8s would win for me only if there are fewer than four more 8s in the 40 unseen digits—about a 40% chance. A better option is to raise. I have two 2s, and with 40 unknown digits we expect roughly four more 2s, for an average total of six. That makes a bid of 6 2s plausible while legally exceeding the current bid by increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. The expected total number of 2s across all 48 digits is approximately 4.8, meaning the actual count is likely below 6. Since the bid exceeds the statistical average and there's no indication of strong support for 2s in prior bids, challenging seems favorable.

Player 3 Reasoning: I’m the opening bidder this round. I have two 3s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits in the other players’ hands, the expected number of additional 3s is about 3.2. The chance that at least two more 3s exist is comfortably high (well over 80%), so bidding 4 3s is a sound, believable opening that doesn’t give away too much information.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 3s is necessary. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit seems more reasonable as I only have one 3. Bidding 4 4s is a safe and logical next step, as it's a higher digit with the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I hold two 4s in my hand, which means I cannot possibly have 5 or more 4s. Bidding higher on 4s is risky, but I can try to increase the digit to 5, which I do not have, or challenge. Since I have no 4s at all, challenging the current bid of 4 4s is the best move, as it's unlikely that there are 4 or more 4s across all hands.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is None, meaning I can bid anything. I have two 9s, one 4, one 3, and one 0. Bidding 2 9s is a reasonable starting bid, as I have two of them. It's a conservative bid to start, allowing me to gauge the other players' hands.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 93274928, which contains three 9s. The current bid by Player 5 is 2 9s, which is already satisfied by my hand alone. Since the total number of digits across all players is 32, it's plausible that there could be more 9s in other players' hands. I can safely make a higher bid to push the game forward and test the other players. I'll bid 3 9s, as I already have three 9s, making this a confident bid while still being conservative enough to avoid an immediate challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher than '3 9s' or challenge. Looking at my hand (50181464), I have zero 9s. Player 1 has increased Player 5's bid of '2 9s' to '3 9s', suggesting they might have at least one 9. With 4 active players having 8 digits each (32 total), and me having zero 9s, there are at most 32 - 8 = 24 digits in other players' hands that could be 9s. For the bid '3 9s' to be valid, we need at least 3 nines total. This is certainly possible, so challenging would be risky. I should make a higher bid. Since I have two 0s in my hand, bidding '4 0s' seems reasonable - I'm increasing the quantity and have some of these digits myself.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my 8-digit hand. That means all four 0s must come from the 24 unseen digits. With random digits the chance of getting at least 4 zeros in 24 draws (Binomial n=24, p=0.1) is only about 21%. It’s even rarer that any single 8-digit hand (like Player 2’s) contains 3+ zeros (≈4%). Therefore the current bid of 4 0s is statistically unlikely to be correct, giving me roughly a 79% chance to win the challenge. Eliminating Player 2 is worth the risk.

Player 3 Reasoning: I hold two 3s. With 16 unknown digits among the other two players, the expected additional count of 3s is about 1.6, so the probability that at least one more 3 exists is high. As the first bidder this round, I need only place an opening bid, and 3 3s is a credible, modest start that leverages my hand without being overly aggressive.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 93274928, which contains two 3s. The current bid is 4 3s by Player 5. With a total of 24 digits across three players, it's plausible that there are at least two more 3s among the other 16 digits, given that each player has 8 digits. However, I can make a higher bid to keep the game going and test the waters. I'll bid 4 4s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have one 4 in my hand, so it's a reasonable bid, and it forces the next player to either increase the bid or challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Player 5 already raised the count of 3s to 4 earlier this round, so they almost certainly hold several 3s themselves. With only three players left, it is quite plausible that between my two 3s and Player 5’s likely stash, there are at least five 3s in total. Challenging 4 4s is risky because Player 1 probably has multiple 4s in hand, giving that bid a good chance of being correct. Instead, I’ll increase the quantity, moving it back to the digit that already showed strength this round. Bidding 5 3s both beats the current bid and is supported by the information I have.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. I have two 3s in my hand. Player 1 bid 4 4s previously, and Player 3 then upped it to 5 3s. Bidding 6 3s would be a reasonable increase, but it's risky as I only have two 3s. Instead, I can bid 5 4s, which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). I have one 4 in my hand, but it's still a gamble. Alternatively, challenging seems too risky, as Player 3 could easily have enough 3s. Therefore, I will bid 5 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 93274928, which contains one 4. The current bid is 5 4s by Player 5. With a total of 24 digits across all players, a bid of 5 4s means that there need to be at least 4 more 4s in the other players' hands combined (16 digits). This is possible but not extremely likely, as it would require a relatively high concentration of 4s. However, looking at the bidding history, Player 5 has been aggressive with bids and previously bid 4 4s which turned out to have an actual count of 6, suggesting they might have a few 4s or are confident in their bids. I also note that Player 3 bid 5 3s just before, which might indicate they have some 3s but not necessarily 4s. Given that I only have one 4, and considering the risk of challenging incorrectly, I think it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I can bid 5 5s, as it's a modest increase and I have no information about the distribution of 5s, making it a reasonable bluff. Alternatively, I could bid higher on a digit I have, like 9s (I have two), but since 9s were bid earlier at 3 by me, increasing to 5 or 6 might be too risky. I'll stick with 5 5s to keep the bid conservative yet higher.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have zero 5s in my hand. That means all five required 5s must come from the 16 digits held by the other two players. With a 10% chance per digit, the expected number of 5s among those 16 digits is only about 1.6, and the probability that there are at least five is roughly 2%. This makes the current bid of 5 5s exceedingly unlikely to be correct, so challenging is the safest play.

Player 3 Reasoning: As the opening bidder this round, I want a bid that is guaranteed to be true yet leaves room to maneuver later. I hold exactly two 3s (digits 3,3) in my own hand, so I know with certainty that there are at least two 3s among the 16 total digits. Bidding 2 3s is therefore completely safe—any immediate challenge would automatically fail—and it satisfies the requirement to be higher than the non-existent current bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: Player 3 bid 2 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. Bidding 3 3s would be a logical next step, increasing the quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on another digit I have, but 3 3s feels like the most reasonable play given the current bid and my hand.

By bidding 4 3s I only need Player 5 to have two 3s (plausible given their confidence in the current bid), and I avoid the high chance of losing an immediate challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: Across 16 total digits, the expected number of any specific digit is 1.6.
