Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bid, I need to establish a reasonable starting point. My hand contains two 7s, so bidding 3 7s is plausible. This accounts for my two 7s and assumes at least one more exists in the remaining 40 digits (5 players). Starting with a modest bid allows for escalation while maintaining credibility.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. Player 0 bid 3 7s. Since I have three 6s, I can make a bid of 4 6s, which is higher than 3 7s. There is a reasonable chance that, across all players, there are at least 4 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (58935580), I don't have any 6s. The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 1. With 6 players having 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. If the digits were evenly distributed, we'd expect about 4.8 of each digit (48 รท 10). So 4 6s is a reasonable bid. However, since I don't have any 6s in my hand, that means the other 5 players would need to have at least 4 6s among them, which is still plausible. I could challenge, but it's risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 5s and two 8s in my hand, so I could bid on either of those. I'll bid 5 5s, increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I need to bid higher or challenge. My hand is 62328404. I have zero 5s. While 5 5s is not an incredibly high bid with 48 total digits, I have no 5s to support it. Bidding higher on 5s would be risky. I have two 2s and two 4s, but bidding 6 of either would be a significant jump without more information. Given I have zero of the bid digit and the bid is moderate, challenging is a reasonable option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding this round. Looking at my hand (58935580), I have two 5s and two 8s. Since I have two 5s in my hand, there's a good chance other players have some 5s as well. With 5 players each having 8 digits, there are 40 total digits in play. A conservative bid would be to start with something based on what I can see in my hand. I'll bid 4 5s, which means I need just 2 more 5s among the other 32 digits held by other players, which is quite reasonable.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand and the previous challenge confirmed 6 5s existed when Player 3 was still active. Since Player 3's hand is now eliminated, the total number of 5s could have decreased. However, challenging 5 5s carries risk because Player 4's bid suggests confidence. I have two 7s in my hand, making 5 7s a plausible higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) to pressure opponents.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 5 7s, which requires at least three more 7s across the remaining 32 digits. With 40 total digits and an average of 4 per digit, this is plausible. Bidding 6 7s increases the quantity while maintaining the same digit, leveraging my existing 7s and pushing the required count to four more 7s, which remains statistically feasible. Challenging carries higher risk given the reasonable probability of the bid being valid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have two 6s and two 2s in my hand. Since the current bid is 6 7s, I need to bid higher. Bidding 7 6s is a reasonable move because it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. If I challenge, I might lose because there could be enough 7s among the other players' hands. Therefore, bidding 7 6s is the safer and more strategic play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (58935580), I have zero 6s. The current bid is 7 6s made by Player 1. With 5 active players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits in play. For there to be 7 6s, and given that I have none, the other 4 players would need to have an average of 1.75 6s each (7 รท 4 = 1.75). While possible, this seems somewhat high. Additionally, from the previous round, we know there were at least 6 5s across all players, and I have two 5s in my hand. I could bid 7 7s, but I only have one 7 in my hand, making this risky. I could also bid 7 8s, which is safer since I have two 8s. However, given that I have zero 6s, challenging seems like the better option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I'm starting this round with my hand containing 58935580. I have two 5s, two 8s, one 9, one 3, and one 0. Since I'm the first to bid in this round, I should make a strategic opening bid. I should bid on a digit I have multiple of to increase confidence. With two 5s in my hand, and knowing that 5s were common in previous rounds (there were at least 6 5s when I bid 5 5s earlier), bidding on 5s seems reasonable. I'll start with a conservative bid of 4 5s, which I'm fairly confident exists across all players based on my two 5s and previous round information.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid of 4 7s is plausible given the expected distribution of digits (total 32 digits, 4 players). Challenging risks elimination since the actual count of 7s could easily meet or exceed 4 (I already have two 7s). Bidding 4 8s is a strategic bluff, escalating to a higher digit while avoiding overcommitting to quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand, making the bid plausible. Bidding 5 7s is a valid higher bid (increasing quantity) and leverages my two 7s. Challenging is risky since 4 8s is possible if others have at least three 8s. Bidding 5 7s balances aggression with the likelihood of having more 7s in other players' hands.

Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand 58935580, I have zero 7s. The current bid is 5 7s made by Player 0. In the previous round, Player 0 bid 6 7s, suggesting they might have multiple 7s in their hand. However, with no 7s in my hand and needing to account for 5 total 7s across all players, this seems risky but not impossible. I have two 8s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 8s. Since the last bid was 5 7s, I can either increase the quantity to 6 or keep the same quantity but increase the digit. I'll bid 5 8s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value, which is a safer play based on the two 8s I hold.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. My hand contains a 9, and bidding 5 9s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 9 and challenges the current bid's digit without risking a higher quantity that may not be supported by my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. My hand contains no 9s, and the expected number of 9s across all 32 digits (assuming uniform distribution) is 3.2. Since the bid requires at least 5 9s, which exceeds the statistical expectation and I have no 9s to contribute, challenging seems optimal. Player 4's bid likely overstates the true count.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Starting the round with a bid of 4 7s leverages my hand strength and aligns with previous bidding patterns where higher quantities were common. With three players remaining and 24 total digits, it's plausible there are at least four 7s across all hands.

Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (58935580), I have no 7s. Player 0 has bid 5 7s, claiming there are at least 5 sevens among all players. Since I have 0 sevens, that means Player 0 and Player 5 would need to have 5 sevens between them. Each player has 8 digits, so it's possible. However, Player 0 increased Player 5's bid from 4 7s to 5 7s, which suggests Player 0 might have at least one 7. If Player 5 had many 7s, they might have bid higher initially. I have two 8s in my hand, so I could bid 5 8s, which would be a valid higher bid. This seems safer than challenging, as the 5 7s bid is plausible.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. With 24 total digits across three players, the remaining two players have 16 digits combined. The expected number of 8s in their hands is low (average ~1.6 additional 8s). Since 5 total 8s would require at least 4 more from the other players, which seems statistically unlikely, challenging is the optimal move.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. Since there are 16 total digits and I have two 7s, the opponent must have at least one 7 for the bid to be true. Challenging risks losing if the opponent has even one 7. Bidding 4 7s is a safer, incremental increase that leverages my existing 7s and forces the opponent to respond. If the bid is challenged later, my two 7s plus potential opponent 7s could meet the 4 7s claim.
