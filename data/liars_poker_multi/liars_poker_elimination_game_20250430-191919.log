Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder (Player 0) with 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected quantity for any digit is 4.8. My hand (46082064) contains two 0s, one 2, two 4s, two 6s, and one 8. Holding two 0s provides a good basis for an opening bid. Bidding 5 0s is slightly above the quantity I hold but close to the statistical average. This requires 3 additional 0s among the other 40 digits, which is probable. Starting with a low digit like 0 keeps the bidding level low initially.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 0s and my hand containing 28091288, I notice that I have no 0s. However, I should consider the possibility of other players having 0s. Since the bid is relatively low and we are at the beginning of the game, it's possible that there are indeed at least 5 zeros among all players. Considering the next possible bids, increasing the quantity to 6 for the digit 0 or bidding on a higher digit seems reasonable. Given that I have two 8s and no other player's hand is visible, bidding on 8s could be risky without more information. Thus, the safest increase would be to bid on a quantity that is not too high but still higher than the current bid. An alternative is to challenge the current bid if it seems unlikely, but given that we're at the start and the bid is not extremely high, making a higher bid might be more strategic.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have no zeros in my hand, so the bid of 6 zeros must come from the other 40 unknown digits. The expected number of zeros among them is only 4, and the chance of seeing at least 6 zeros is under 25%. The bid seems too unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Of the 32 unknown digits, we expect about 3.2 more 7s, for a total expectation of around 5.2. Opening with 4 7s gives a high probability (~84%) of being correct while setting a reasonably strong baseline.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s, and I have multiple digits in my hand that are greater than 7. Specifically, I have a 9 in my hand. Given the remaining digits, bidding 5 8s seems like a reasonable move, increasing both quantity and digit from the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s made by Player 3. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, the total number of digits is 40. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Bidding 6 0s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and I have no information about other players' hands. However, I should also consider the likelihood of 5 8s being true. With my one 8, the remaining 4 8s must be distributed among the other 4 players, which seems possible but I have no 8s to spare to make it more likely. I will challenge the bid as it seems high given my information.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning I can make any initial bid. I have the digits 4, 2, 9, 1, 3, 5, 6, 6 in my hand. Counting my digits, I have two 6s. Since no one has bid yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 2 6s seems reasonable as it's based directly on my hand and sets a low bar for others.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, making the current bid of 2 6s already valid. Challenging would guarantee my elimination. To continue the game, I must raise the bid. Bidding 3 6s leverages my existing two 6s and assumes at least one additional 6 exists among the remaining 24 digits across three opponents.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:3 - google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (46082064). This means the bid requires only one more 6 among the remaining 24 digits held by the other 3 players. The expected number of 6s in those 24 digits is 2.4 (24/10). Therefore, the current bid of 3 6s is highly likely to be true, and challenging is risky. Player 4 previously bid 2 6s, and Player 5 raised to 3 6s, indicating some belief or possession of 6s. Since I hold two 6s, bidding 4 6s is a reasonable escalation. This bid requires two additional 6s from the other 24 digits, which is plausible (close to the expected value of 2.4). It leverages my strong hand in 6s and follows the bidding trend.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 sixes. I only have one six, so relying on others to hold at least three more is borderline. However, I have two sevens in my hand and expect about 2.4 more among the other 24 cards (0.1Ã—24). That gives an expected total of about 4.4 sevens, making a bid of 4 sevens quite plausible while still strictly higher than 4 sixes (same quantity, higher digit).

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 2. I have two 6s in my hand, and the previous bids were all for 6s or 7s. Given that there are 32 total digits remaining and 4 active players with 8 digits each, the maximum possible count for any digit is 32. The bid of 4 7s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. Since my hand contains two 6s and the highest bid so far is for 6s with a quantity of 4, I should consider if bidding higher is feasible or if challenging is more strategic.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, and the expected total number of 6s across all players (assuming uniform distribution) is approximately 3.2. This suggests the bid of 5 is likely exaggerated. Given the history of successful challenges and the low probability of reaching 5 6s, challenging is the optimal move.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', which means I can make any initial bid. I have two 6s in my hand. Since there are 3 active players and each has 8 digits, there are 24 digits in total. I should make a conservative bid that could be reasonable given my hand and the total number of digits. Bidding 3 6s seems like a good starting point as it's based on my hand and not overly aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand (46082064). This means only one more 6 is needed across the other two players' 16 digits for the current bid to be true. The expected number of 6s in those 16 digits is 1.6 (16/10), making the current bid very likely correct. Challenging is therefore risky. I should increase the bid. Since I have two 6s, bidding 4 6s is a strong possibility. This requires two additional 6s among the remaining 16 digits, which is plausible (slightly above the expected 1.6, but reasonable, especially given that a bid of 5 6s won in the previous round with 7 actual 6s out of 32 digits). Bidding 4 6s leverages my hand directly and puts pressure on the next player.

Player 2 Reasoning: I only have one 6 in my hand. To satisfy the bid of 4 sixes, the other two players must hold at least three 6s among their 16 cards. The probability of that is low (around 21%), so challenging is the best play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to start the bidding in this head-to-head round with 16 total digits (8 in my hand, 8 in Player 4's). My hand is 46082064, containing two 0s, one 2, two 4s, two 6s, and one 8. Since there's no current bid, I must make one. My strongest digits are 0, 4, and 6, each appearing twice. A safe opening bid would be '2' of any of these digits. However, a slightly more assertive bid, assuming Player 4 has at least one of my strong digits (which is statistically likely), would be '3'. I have two 0s. Bidding '3 0s' is a reasonable opening, requiring Player 4 to have at least one 0. This starts the bidding at a moderate level based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s made by Player 0. I have the hand 42913566, which contains one 0. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least 3 0s. Since I only have one 0, and Player 0 could have at most 8, it's possible but unlikely that between us there are 3 0s. However, I must also consider my goal is to either make a valid higher bid or challenge if I think the bid is unlikely. My hand does not provide strong evidence for a high number of 0s, but I can try to make a higher bid or challenge. A slightly higher bid could be 4 6s, as 6 is a higher digit than 0 and I have multiple 6s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 4. I have two 6s in my hand (46082064). For the bid to be true, Player 4 needs at least two 6s out of their 8 digits. In the previous round (3 players), I bid 4 6s, Player 2 challenged, and the actual count was 5. Since I had two 6s then, Player 4 must have had three 6s in that round for the total to be 5. Assuming Player 4's hand hasn't drastically changed, they likely still have three 6s. This means the total number of 6s between us is likely 5 (my 2 + their 3). Therefore, Player 4's bid of 4 6s is very likely true, making a challenge risky. The next logical bid is 5 6s. This bid aligns with the probable actual count (5), leverages my own two 6s, and directly raises the quantity on the digit Player 4 bid.

Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and considering my hand, bidding 6 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. However, I should also consider if challenging could be more beneficial if the bid seems unlikely.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand (46082064). The current bid is 6 6s made by Player 4. In the previous round (with Player 0, Player 2, and Player 4), my bid of 4 6s was challenged, and the actual count was revealed to be 5. Since I had two 6s then (and still do), the combined number of 6s held by Player 2 and Player 4 in that round was 5 - 2 = 3. Now, with only Player 4 and myself remaining, the total number of 6s can be at most 5 (my two 6s plus the maximum of three 6s Player 4 could have). Therefore, Player 4's bid of 6 6s is mathematically impossible. I should challenge.
