Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With six players and 48 digits, the average count for each digit is about 4.8. Bidding 3 6s leverages my known two and expects at least one more among the other players, making it a reasonable opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 6s and my hand containing one 6, I must decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Since my hand has a limited number of 6s, bidding higher on 6s might not be the best strategy. However, I also have other digits that could potentially be bid upon. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 players, the average number of any digit across all players is around 8 (since 48 digits / 6 players = 8 digits per player, and assuming an even distribution, each digit 0-9 would appear approximately 8 times). Given this, bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity could be a viable strategy, but it's essential to choose a digit that is reasonably likely to occur at least the bid quantity times. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s and other digits. Since the current bid is on 6s, and I don't have enough information to safely bid higher on 6s, I could consider bidding on a different digit. However, without more information about the distribution of other digits among the players, any bid higher than the current one involves some risk. Challenging the current bid of 3 6s might be a safer option if I believe it's unlikely, given my own hand and the average distribution. But, considering I have one 6, and there are 48 digits in total, it's possible that there are indeed at least 3 sixes among all players. Thus, making a strategic bid that increases the quantity or moves to a higher digit while being mindful of the potential distribution is key. Since I have two 8s and an 8 is a higher digit than 6, I could strategically bid on 8s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same or slightly higher, considering the risk and potential reward.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. With 48 total digits, the expected average count for any digit is 4.8. A bid of 3 is below average and therefore quite likely to be true. Challenging seems risky, especially since I hold zero 8s, making it more likely the required three 8s exist among the other 40 digits. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 3 9s or 4 of any digit. My hand is 95121435. I have two 1s and two 5s. Bidding based on my hand is a good strategy. Bidding 4 1s is a valid increase (higher quantity) and is supported by my holding two 1s, making it statistically more plausible than a random guess.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. I could bid 4 2s, which is a safe increase. However, since the bidding just started this round and the bid is still relatively low, I will bid 5 0s to increase the quantity and potentially put pressure on other players.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The current bid of 5 0s by Player 3 seems reasonable. I should try to increase the digit to a higher number, considering I have no 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, or 9s in my hand. The highest digit I can bid is 8, but I don't have any 8s. Since the current bid is for 0s, I should focus on increasing the quantity for 0s, but I only have one 0, so I should challenge the bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 9s made by Player 4. I have two 9s in my hand, and there are 4 other active players, making a total of 5 players including myself. Given that each player has 8 digits, there are 40 digits in total. With 2 nines in my hand, it's possible that other players have at least one 9, making the total count of 9s at least 2. I should bid higher than 1 9s. A reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll increase the digit and quantity slightly. Bidding 2 9s seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 6s' and my hand '39586845', I notice I have one 6. Considering the total digits remaining is 40 and there are 5 players, the maximum possible count for any digit is 40. Since the current bid is relatively low and my hand contains a 6, I should consider bidding higher. However, I must ensure my bid is reasonable and does not overestimate the total count of the digit. A higher quantity or a higher digit is required for my bid. Given that I have two 8s and an 8 is higher than 6, I can bid on 8s, increasing the digit. Since the last bid on 8s was '3 8s' by me in the previous round and considering the elimination of Player 3, the game dynamics have changed. I should aim for a quantity that is not too high but still competitive, taking into account the reduced number of players and thus the reduced total number of digits. Given these considerations and aiming to make a strategic move, I decide to bid on a higher digit than 6, considering my hand and the previous bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. There are 5 players with 8 digits each, totaling 40 digits. The expected number of any digit is 40/10 = 4. I have zero 8s in my hand (95121435). For the bid of 3 8s to be true, the other 4 players (32 digits) must hold at least three 8s. The expected number of 8s among those 32 digits is 3.2, making the bid statistically plausible. Challenging seems risky as it's a low bid close to the expected value. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 1s and two 5s. Bidding 4 1s is higher than 3 8s (higher quantity). With two 1s in my hand, I only need two more 1s among the remaining 32 digits held by other players. Since the expected number of 1s among those 32 digits is 3.2, bidding 4 1s is a statistically reasonable and safe bid supported by my hand. Bidding 4 5s would be similarly justified. Bidding 3 9s is also possible (I have one 9, and previous bids suggest others might hold 9s), but bidding 4 based on my own strong suits (1s or 5s) seems a better strategic move.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is '4 6s' made by Player 4. I have two 6s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains two 6s, I can see if there's potential for a higher bid. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Given that there are 5 active players with 8 digits each, the total number of digits is 40. If I bid '5 6s', it seems plausible but risky. However, bidding '4 7s' would be a safer bet as it increases the digit and seems more achievable given the distribution of digits.

Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 6s in my hand. To outbid 4 7s I can raise the quantity to 5 and choose 6s, leveraging my extra 6. With an expected ~3.2 additional 6s among the 32 unknown cards, there’s over a 60% chance of at least five 6s total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 6s and my hand containing two 6s, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least 5 sixes among all players. With 40 total digits and each player having 8 digits, the maximum number of any single digit is capped. Since I have two 6s, and considering the bids that have been made, especially the progression from 3 6s to 4 6s and now 5 6s, it seems plausible that there could be enough 6s to meet or exceed the current bid. However, without more information about the other players' hands, I must weigh the risk of challenging versus bidding higher. Given that the current bid is already quite high for a single digit (5 6s), and considering the total number of digits remaining, bidding higher in quantity might not be the best strategy. Instead, I should consider challenging the bid if I believe it's unlikely, but given my own contribution to the count of 6s and the pattern of bids, I should look for a safer option that doesn't risk immediate elimination. Since I need to bid higher than 5 6s and considering the constraints, a reasonable next step could be to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, but given the high quantity of 6s already bid, the safest increase would be in the digit, not the quantity. However, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same (5) might not be feasible given the high value of 6s already bid. Therefore, my best option, considering the need to strictly increase the bid and the potential distribution of digits, is to carefully consider what higher bids are plausible and likely to be true, given the information at hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. The expected average count for any digit is 4. A bid of 5 is slightly above average. I have zero 7s in my hand (95121435), meaning the other 4 players (32 digits) must have at least five 7s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 7s in those 32 digits is 3.2. While Player 5 bid 4 7s and Player 1 raised to 5 7s, suggesting some 7s might exist, challenging is a possibility given I have none. However, I have two 1s and two 5s. Bidding higher based on my hand seems safer. A bid of 6 1s requires four additional 1s among the remaining 32 digits (expected 3.2), which is plausible given I hold two. This leverages my hand's strength and puts pressure on the next player. Bidding 6 5s is similarly justifiable. I will bid 6 1s.

I have 4 9s and 1 6, but I don't have any 8s or higher. Since the current bid is low and I have a good chance of winning, I will increase the quantity on the digit 1.

Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 6s and my hand containing 39586845, I have one 6. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 32 and there are 4 active players, each with 8 digits, the bid of 3 6s seems plausible but not extremely high. Since I need to make a bid that is strictly higher, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Given that my hand does not provide a clear advantage in any specific digit, and considering the bidding history where higher bids have been challenged and lost, I should aim for a conservative increase. However, since the current bid is 3 6s, and I only have one 6, bidding higher on 6s might not be the best strategy without more information. Instead, looking at my hand, I notice I have two 8s and an 8 has been bid before, suggesting some presence of 8s. But since the digit needs to be higher or the quantity, and given that 3 8s has been a previous bid, I must consider if there's enough 8s or higher digits to justify a higher bid. Given the constraints and aiming to be conservative while still bidding higher, I could consider bidding on a higher digit if I had enough information to suggest its presence, but given my hand and the need to bid higher than 3 6s, I must weigh the risk of challenging versus bidding. Since I don't have sufficient information to confidently bid higher on any digit without risking being challenged, and given the history of challenges, the safest option might be to challenge the current bid if it seems unlikely, but since 3 6s is not extremely high and could be feasible, I need to decide based on the likelihood of the bid being true. Considering all factors, including the total digits remaining and the distribution in my hand, I should look for a digit that could reasonably have a higher count without overestimating. However, the presence of two 8s in my hand and considering previous bids, I might consider if there's a reasonable next step that doesn't involve challenging but rather making an informed bid based on the game's progression and my hand's composition.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have two 5s in my hand (95121435). There are 32 total digits among 4 players. For the bid to be true, there need to be at least 2 more 5s among the other 24 digits held by the other 3 players. The expected number of 5s in those 24 digits is 24/10 = 2.4. Needing 2 is very plausible, so challenging seems risky. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 1s and two 5s. Possible higher bids include 4 6s+ or 5 0s+. Bidding 5 1s seems strong, as I hold two 1s, meaning only 3 more are needed from the remaining 24 digits (expected 2.4). Bidding 5 5s is also possible, but raising the quantity on the digit just bid might invite a challenge. Bidding 5 1s leverages my hand strength effectively.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Current bid is None. I have two 6s in my hand. I can bid on a digit with a high quantity or a high digit. Considering the remaining total digits (24), I should focus on a high digit to maximize my chances. Bidding on 8s seems reasonable, as it's a high digit and I have no 8s in my hand, so I won't be challenged on this.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 1 8s and I have two 8s in my hand, increasing the quantity seems reasonable. Since the total digits remaining are 24 and there are only three players left, bidding a higher quantity of the same digit or a higher digit with the same quantity could be risky. However, considering I have two 8s, bidding 2 8s seems like a safe and logical move, as it increases the quantity of the same digit, which is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s made by Player 1. With 24 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 2.4. A bid of 2 8s is statistically very likely to be true, making a challenge risky. I have zero 8s in my hand (95121435). To make a higher bid, I can bid 2 9s or increase the quantity to 3. I have two 1s and two 5s, making these my strongest digits. Bidding 3 1s is a safe, credible increase over 2 8s, leveraging one of my strongest holdings and forcing the next player (Player 4) to make a higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have a 1 in my hand. I can increase the digit to 8, which is a higher digit than 1, or increase the quantity to a higher number. I can see that I have a high digit 8 in my hand, so I will bid on that.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Considering the current bid is 4 1s and my hand contains one 1, I need to assess the likelihood of this bid being true. Given that there are 24 digits remaining and I have 8 of them, it's possible that the other players could collectively have 3 or more 1s. However, without more information about their hands, I must rely on the bidding history and my own hand. Since my hand does not provide strong evidence against the bid, and challenging could lead to elimination if the bid is correct, I should consider making a higher bid if possible. Looking at my hand, 39586845, I notice I have two 8s and other digits. The bidding history shows a progression but does not give clear insight into the distribution of digits. Given the constraints and aiming to make a strategic move, bidding higher than 4 1s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since my hand has two 8s and considering the bids made earlier in the game, such as bids on 8s, I could attempt to increase the digit, considering the quantity of 4 might be challenging to surpass with a higher digit. Thus, a reasonable bid could be to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same or slightly higher if feasible. However, given the elimination of players and the bids on 1s and other digits, a cautious approach is necessary.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s made by Player 1. I hold one '2' (95121435). For the bid to be true, there must be at least three '2's among the other 16 digits held by Player 1 and Player 4. This is plausible, but not certain (expected number is 1.6). Challenging seems risky at this relatively low quantity. I need to make a higher bid. Options include bidding 4 3s, 4 4s, 4 5s, etc., or increasing the quantity to 5. I have two '1's and two '5's. Bidding 4 5s is safe (needing 2 more from 16). Bidding 5 1s is also a strong option. I previously bid 3 1s, and Player 4 raised to 4 1s, suggesting they might hold some '1's. Player 1 then moved to 4 2s, possibly indicating they don't hold many '1's. Therefore, bidding 5 1s seems credible, leveraging my two '1's and the previous bidding history around '1's. It requires three more '1's from the other 16 digits, which is plausible given Player 4's bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is None. I have 4 in my hand. Given that the total digits remaining is 16, I can safely bid a high quantity with a moderate digit. Bidding 8 4s seems reasonable.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '8 4s' and my hand '39586845', which contains two 4s and other digits, I must assess the likelihood of there being at least eight 4s in total between Player 4 and me. Since each player has 8 digits and there are only 16 digits in total, the maximum number of any single digit is 16. However, achieving exactly 8 of a specific digit like '4' seems plausible but is on the higher end, especially considering the randomness and distribution of digits in Liar's Poker. My hand contributes 2 to the count of '4s', meaning Player 4 would need to have at least 6 '4s' for the bid to be valid. Given that I have no information about Player 4's hand other than their bids, and considering the bidding history which shows a mix of bids but does not specifically indicate a heavy presence of '4s', I must decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. Making a higher bid would require either bidding a higher quantity of '4s', which seems risky given the total number of digits, or bidding the same quantity with a higher digit, which could be a safer strategy but still speculative. Challenging the bid allows me to test the validity of Player 4's claim directly. Given the potential risk and the fact that I can directly test the bid's validity, challenging seems like a reasonable approach, especially since I do not have enough information to comfortably make a higher bid.
