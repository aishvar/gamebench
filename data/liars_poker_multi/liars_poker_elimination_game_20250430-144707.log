Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 54929811, which has two 1s, and single occurrences of 5, 4, 9, 2, and 8. Starting with a conservative bid based on my hand seems reasonable. I will bid 3 1s, assuming there might be at least one more 1 among the other players' hands, given there are 48 total digits across 6 players.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have two 7s and one 9 in my hand, which suggests I can make a higher bid on a digit I hold. Increasing the quantity to 3 but bidding on a higher digit than 1 is allowed. I will bid 3 7s since I hold two 7s and 7 is higher than 1, making it a valid and reasonable bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have a 7 in my hand, which is the digit being bid. I should bid a higher quantity or digit. I can increase the quantity to 4, as it's a conservative increase, or I can bid on a higher digit like 8, considering the remaining digits and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 2. I have 3 eights in my hand. Given that there are 6 active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total number of digits is 48. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. I should calculate the likelihood of there being at least 4 eights in total. Since I have 3 eights, the remaining 5 players must have at least 1 eight in total for the bid to be valid. This seems plausible but not certain. I can either make a higher bid or challenge. A reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have no information about other players' hands, I will make a conservative bid that is higher than 4 8s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', which means I can make any initial bid. I have the digits 8, 1, 0, 8, 8, 4, 8, 6 in my hand. I see that I have three 8s and no 9s (since the previous round's bid of 4 9s was challenged and won). A reasonable bid would be to start with a quantity and digit that I know exists. Bidding '3 8s' seems like a good starting point as it's based on my own hand and not too high to be unbelievable given the total digits remaining.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 3. My hand contains one 8, so the maximum total count I can contribute is 1. Since the bid of 3 8s is already above my maximum possible contribution, it's highly unlikely that the total count of 8s across all players is 3 or more. Challenging now would be logical, as the bid exceeds the maximum possible total I could support with my hand. Therefore, I will challenge the bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my turn as Player 3. I have the hand 81088486, which contains two 8s. Since I need to make a bid that is valid and higher than 'None', I can start with a low quantity and digit. Bidding 2 8s seems reasonable as it's based on my own hand and sets a starting point for others to follow.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s made by Player 3. In my hand, I have no 8s out of my 8 digits. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 2 8s is quite low and likely to be true given that each player has 8 digits. I think it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge such a low bid. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding on 1s might be a reasonable choice. I'll bid 3 1s, which is higher than the current bid of 2 8s by increasing the quantity.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s by Player 0. I have one '7' in my hand and the previous bids have been low quantities or low digits. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit. Since 7 is higher than 1, I can bid 3 7s. This is a reasonable bid given the current state and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 2. I have 8s in my hand (81088486), specifically two 8s. Given that there are 4 active players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 32 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. With my two 8s and the need for the total to be at least 4 8s, it seems plausible but I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should consider if 4 8s is likely to be true or if I can make a higher bid. Given I have two 8s, bidding higher seems risky without knowing others' hands. However, I can see if I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity or the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 3. In my hand, I have two 9s, which means there are at least two 9s in the total count. With 32 total digits across 4 players, it's possible that there are two more 9s in the other players' hands to make the bid of 4 9s valid. However, since the bid is relatively low and plausible, I will choose to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I will bid 5 1s because I have three 1s in my hand, which supports a higher count, and it increases the quantity over the current bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have one '1' in my hand, but not many to strongly support a higher quantity of 1s. The next valid bid must be either 5 2s or higher quantity of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, which could support bidding 5 7s, but that seems high given the current bid. Bidding 5 2s is safer and a valid increment. However, considering the total digits and previous bids, 5 1s is plausible, but pushing beyond that to 5 2s or 6 0s might be risky. Since the current bid is not excessively high and I have no strong evidence to challenge, I will raise slightly to 5 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s made by Player 2. I have 8 secret digits: 81088486. I see that I have two 1s in my hand. Given that there are 4 active players and each has 8 digits, there are 32 digits in total. The bid of 6 1s seems high but not impossible. However, I must consider if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is more strategic. Since my goal is to either make a valid higher bid or challenge, I will analyze my hand and the bidding history. I have two 1s, and bidding a higher quantity with the same digit or a higher digit with the same or higher quantity is needed. I can bid 7 1s as it's higher in quantity and I have two 1s myself, which could be enough to make this bid plausible given the total number of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 54929811, which contains two 1s. The current bid is 7 1s by Player 3. With a total of 32 digits across all players, a bid of 7 1s means that there need to be at least 5 more 1s in the other players' hands combined (since I have 2). Given that each player has 8 digits, it's possible but not highly likely that the other three players have an average of nearly 2 1s each. Looking at the bidding history, bids on 1s have been increasing steadily (from 3 to 5 to 6 to 7), which might indicate players are bluffing or pushing the bid higher. However, since I have two 1s myself, I think it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I can bid 8 1s, as it's a reasonable escalation and keeps the pressure on others to either challenge or bid higher. If I were to challenge and lose, I’d be eliminated, so I’ll avoid the risk for now.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s, which means there are at least eight '1's among all 32 digits. I have one '1' in my hand. Given the previous bids and the fact that '1's have been frequently bid on, it's plausible but pushing the limit. The next valid higher bid must be either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. I have two '7's and two '9's in my hand, so bidding 8 7s or 8 9s is possible but risky since it assumes many of those digits exist in other players' hands. Increasing the quantity to 9 with any digit is also an option but risky. Considering the high bid of 8 1s, and that the previous bid was 7 1s, bidding 9 1s seems too risky without more '1's in my hand. I will bid 8 7s, which is a valid higher bid with the same quantity but a higher digit, supported by having two '7's in my hand. This bid pressures others and keeps the game moving.

The highest digit in my hand is 8, but bidding 8 8s would be the same as the current bid. The next highest digit in my hand is 9, but I don't have any 9s.

The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. With the current bid being 9 8s, I need to assess if it's likely or not. If I bid 10 8s, it would be higher in quantity but I must consider if 9 8s is feasible. Given that I have 3 8s and assuming the others might have some as well, 9 8s seems plausible but risky. I should calculate the feasibility based on my hand and the total digits remaining.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 10 8s made by Player 3. In my hand, I have only one 8 out of my 8 digits. With a total of 32 digits across all 4 players, a bid of 10 8s means that the other 3 players must collectively have at least 9 8s in their 24 digits. This seems quite high, as it would require an average of 3 8s per player among the others, which is unlikely given the random distribution of digits. Historically, bids on 8s have been challenged before, and while some succeeded, the current bid is significantly higher. I could bid higher, such as 11 8s or 10 9s, but I believe the current bid is already a stretch. Therefore, challenging seems like the better option to potentially eliminate Player 3 if the count is less than 10.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 54929811, which contains no 7s. The current bid is 5 7s by Player 2. With a total of 24 digits across all players, a bid of 5 7s means that there should be at least 5 sevens in play. Since I have none, the other two players would need to have at least 5 sevens combined in their 16 digits. This is possible but not highly likely, as it would require a significant concentration of 7s in their hands. However, looking at the bidding history, Player 1 previously bid 4 7s, which might indicate they have some 7s, and Player 2 raised to 5 7s, possibly bluffing or having a few. Given that I have a strong hand with multiple 1s (three 1s), I can make a higher bid of 6 1s, which is plausible since I contribute 3 to the count, and only 3 more are needed from the remaining 16 digits. This seems safer than challenging a bid that could be valid.

Since I have only one '1' and no '7's, and there are 24 digits total, 6 1s is plausible but pushing it. Bidding 6 2s or higher would be a significant jump and less likely. Bidding 7 1s would be a higher quantity but seems risky without more '1's in my hand. Challenging now could be a good move as the previous count of '1's might be overestimated.

Since there are 16 digits total and I hold three 7s, it is quite plausible that there are at least 4 7s in total. To raise the bid, I must increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. The next valid bids could be 5 0s or higher digits with quantity 4. I have no zeros in my hand, so bidding 5 0s might be risky. Instead, I can bid 4 8s, which is a higher digit with the same quantity. Although I do not have any 8s, this is a reasonable strategic increase. Bidding 4 8s is a valid and safer move than challenging at this point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (96470977). The bid is quite high considering there are only 16 digits total between two players. To raise, I must bid higher than 5 8s. The next valid bids could be 6 0s or higher quantities of other digits. I have two 7s, but bidding 6 7s would be a big jump and risky. Challenging now might be premature as the bid is plausible given the previous bids. I will bid 6 0s as zeroes are rare and I have one zero, making the bid more believable and putting pressure on the opponent.
