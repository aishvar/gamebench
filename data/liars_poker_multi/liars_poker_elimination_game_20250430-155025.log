Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s and one 5, 7, 0, 3, 4, 8 in my hand. Since I'm the first to bid and there are 48 digits in total, starting with a conservative bid based on my hand seems reasonable. I'll bid one 8, as it's a high digit and I have one in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 8s made by Player 0. My hand contains two 8s (68522189), meaning the total count of 8s across all players is at least two. Therefore, the bid of 1 8s is true, and I must make a higher bid. Bidding 2 8s is a valid higher bid (increasing the quantity) and is a safe bid based on the contents of my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 19662530, which contains no 8s. The current bid is 2 8s, which is plausible with 48 digits in play. Since I can't challenge reasonably, I should make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 2 6s is legal and based on my hand. Alternatively, I could raise the quantity to 3 8s, but I have no 8s, so it's riskier. Bidding 2 9s (I have one 9) is also possible. I'll bid 2 9s, as it's a safe, legal increment and doesn't increase the quantity yet.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Challenging 2 9s is risky—there’s a high probability at least two 9s exist among 48 cards. The next valid bid must raise to quantity 3. I hold two 6s, so bidding 3 6s is credible and raises the quantity appropriately.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand. Given the previous bids, and the fact that Player 2 bid 2 9s, it's reasonable to assume there aren't many high digits. Bidding higher than 3 6s would be risky without knowing more about other players' hands. Challenging feels like the best option here, as it's unlikely 3 players have enough 6s to reach a total of 3.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits, the expected number of 6s among them is about 3.2, giving an expected total of around 5.2. Opening with a bid of 3 6s is very safe and also restricts opponents to either raise the quantity or use only digits 7-9 at the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 5s and one 6 in my hand, totaling 3 digits that are either 5 or 6. Given that the previous round's bid of 3 6s resulted in a count of 5, it's likely that there are more than 3 sixes. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 3 7s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit, making it a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which means there needs to be at least two more 7s among the other four players. Given that the previous bid was 3 6s and it was challenged but the actual count was 5, it's plausible that higher digits are less common. I think it's unlikely there are three 7s in total, so I will challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 5, one 7, one 0, two 2s, one 3, one 4, and one 8 in my hand. Since the current bid is None and I'm starting the bidding, I should make a conservative bid based on my hand. I have one 8, so I can start with a low bid to test the waters.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 8s. My hand is 68522189, which contains two 8s. This means the current bid of 1 8s is true. I must make a bid that is strictly higher than 1 8s. The safest and most direct bid based on my hand is 2 8s, as I know I have at least two 8s. This is a valid bid higher than 1 8s.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:4 - gpt-4.1-2025-04-14) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 19662530. Counting the digits, I have one 8. The current bid is 2 8s, which means across all 32 digits, there must be at least two 8s. With four players, it's likely that at least one other 8 is present, so challenging now would be premature. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity on a higher digit. I have two 6s and two 5s, but only one 9 and one 8. Bidding 2 9s is legal and leverages the fact that I have one 9, and the probability that another 9 exists is moderate. Alternatively, I could bid 3 0s or 3 1s, but I only have one of each. Since 2 9s is a minimal raise and keeps the pressure low, I will bid that.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have no 9s myself, and with 32 digits total the expected count of 9s is about 3, so the bid of 2 9s is plausible – not worth challenging. The next valid raise must be quantity 3. I hold two zeros and expect at least one more among the other 24 digits, so bidding 3 zeros is a conservative, likely claim and the lowest possible raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand (from 57023248). The current bid is 3 0s. With 4 players remaining and 32 total digits, the average per digit is about 3.2. Given that 0 is a less common digit and I only have one, it's unlikely there are 3 or more 0s across all hands. Challenging seems like the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. With 16 unknown digits among the other two players, there’s about a 90% chance of at least one more 0, so bidding 3 zeros is a safe opening bid that also sets a solid baseline.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. My hand is 68522189, which contains two 8s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is well-supported by the two 8s I hold. This bid requires only one additional 8 from the other two players combined, which is a reasonable expectation with 16 unknown digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 19662530. I have one 8 and one 9. The current bid is 3 8s. With only one 8 in my hand, I would need the other two players to collectively have at least two more 8s for the bid to be true. Statistically, that's possible but not guaranteed. However, I have two 6s in my hand, and the last few rounds have shown 6s appearing frequently. I can safely increase the bid to 3 9s, since I have one 9, and 9s are less likely to have been bid up already, making it a safe incremental raise.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand, so all 3 9s must be in the other 16 cards. The probability of at least three 9s in those 16 is only about 21%, making the bid unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I hold two 0s in my hand, so a bid of 2 0s is guaranteed true. Under uniform randomness, the chance of at least two 0s in 16 unknown digits is only about 48.5%, so my opponent will rationally challenge and lose. This wins me the round immediately.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s by Player 3. In a previous round, Player 3 successfully bid on 0s (3 0s, actual count 4), suggesting they likely hold a significant number of 0s. Challenging the current bid of 2 0s, while potentially favorable based on random distribution given I have zero 0s, becomes riskier considering this history. My hand contains two 2s. Bidding 2 2s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is guaranteed to be true based on my hand. This is a safe move that puts pressure back on Player 3, forcing them to make a higher bid or challenge a bid I know is true.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. My hand is 68522189. My hand contains two 8s. This means the total count of 8s is at least two. Bidding 2 8s is a valid bid as it keeps the quantity the same (2) but increases the digit from 6 to 8. This bid is guaranteed to be true based on my hand alone, making it a safe and strong move.
