Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I should make an opening bid that reflects my hand and doesn't give away too much information. I have two 4s, two 8s, one 2, one 5, one 1, and one 9. Statistically, each digit should appear about 4.8 times in the 48 digits. I'll start with a conservative but safe opening bid: 2 4s, as I have two in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand and the current bid is 2 4s. Raising to 3 0s increases the quantity, is strictly higher, and is safe—I'll win any challenge since I hold all three zeros myself.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s, which requires at least three 0s in total. By bidding 4 0s, I increase the quantity, which is a valid move. This leverages my existing 0s and pushes the bid higher, maintaining pressure on other players.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have no 0s in my hand, but I have a 4. Bidding 5 4s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have the hand 62272506, which contains one 4 and two other relatively high digits (7, 6, 6, 5, 2). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have a lot of 4s or higher digits in my hand, I'll play it safe and bid 5 5s, increasing the digit. This seems like a reasonable bid given the information available.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have zero 5s in my hand (83916386). For the bid to be true, there must be at least five 5s among the other 5 players (40 digits). The expected number of 5s in those 40 digits is 4 (40/10). While 5 is only slightly above average, my lack of 5s makes challenging tempting. However, challenging this early is risky. I have two 6s and two 8s. Bidding 6 6s is a statistically sound move. The total expected number of 6s across all 48 digits is 4.8. Since I hold two 6s, we need approximately 2.8 more from the other 40 digits for the average count. Bidding 6 requires four more 6s from the other players, which is exactly the expected number (40/10 = 4) among their digits. This bid utilizes my hand strength and increases the quantity, putting pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. In my hand (48251947), I have zero 6s. With 48 digits in play and 8 per player, the expected number of any digit is around 4.8 per digit. Bidding 6 for a specific digit is a bit above average. Since I have zero 6s, and unless another player has an unusually high number of 6s, 6 is a risky bid. Given the statistical unlikelihood and my own hand, I will challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's the start of a new round and I am the first to bid. My hand is 48251947, which contains two 4s, two 7s, one 8, one 2, one 5, and one 9. Since there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 digits total), a safe opening bid is to choose a digit I have multiples of, such as 4 or 7. Bidding 2 4s is a reasonable and non-risky opening bid, as I personally hold two 4s and it's likely there are more among all players.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand guaranteeing at least three 0s in total. The current bid is 2 4s, so bidding 3 0s strictly increases the quantity and is safe—if challenged, I win.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. If the total count of 0s across all players is less than 3, challenging would win. Since I already have two 0s, it's plausible the total is 2, making this a risky but potentially winning challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand. With 32 total digits (including mine), each digit appears roughly 10% of the time, so the other 24 digits should contain about 2.4 zeros on average. To reach a total of 4 zeros I need at least one zero from the other players, which has about a 91% chance (1–0.9^24). Therefore opening with 4 0s is a strong yet safe bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have 3 digits in my hand, none of which are 0. I can make a valid higher bid by increasing the digit to 1, as it's a higher value than 0. I'll bid 4 1s.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s, and I need to make a higher bid or challenge. My hand is 62272506, which contains one 1. The total count of 1s across all players must be at least 1 (from my hand) plus some from other players. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I see two 2s and two 6s in my hand, and the bid is on 1s, I can consider bidding on a higher digit or increasing the quantity. Bidding 4 2s or 5 1s are both valid options. Given that I have some confidence in there being more 2s (since I have two), bidding 4 2s seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 48251947. I have no 2s, so the current bid of 4 2s is already risky from my perspective. However, I need to either challenge or make a higher bid. The next legal bids are 4 3s or 5 0s. In my hand, I have one 4, one 8, two 5s, one 1, one 9, and two 7s. I have no 3s and only one 4. Given that I have no 2s and the bid is 4 2s, it's plausible someone might have 2s, but with 32 digits in play, the expected count for each digit is about 3.2. Bidding 4 3s is risky since I have no 3s, and increasing the quantity to 5 of any digit is a bold move. Since the bid of 4 2s already seems aggressive and I have none, I will challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Since it's my turn to start bidding and I have the hand 62272506, I can see I have two 2s, two 6s, and other digits. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and the total number of digits remaining (24). I have a total of 8 digits, and there are 16 digits with other players. A conservative bid considering my hand could involve the digits I have more of. I have two 6s and two 2s. A bid of 4 2s seems reasonable as it is a digit I have and doubles the quantity of what I have, considering the other players might also have 2s.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 2s in my hand and there are only 16 unknown cards. The probability of at least four 2s among those is very low (under 10%), so Player 4’s bid of 4 2s is unlikely. I should challenge.
