Player 0 Reasoning: Since no previous bid has been made, I can start by making an initial bid. Looking at my hand 51490825, I have digits: 5, 1, 4, 9, 0, 8, 2, 5. Counting each digit: 0 (1), 1 (1), 2 (1), 4 (1), 5 (2), 8 (1), 9 (1). The highest count I have for any digit is 2 (for 5). To make a safe opening bid, I should choose a quantity that I can reasonably expect to be met or exceeded, considering all players' hands. Since total digits are 48, and I have at most 2 of any digit, starting with a bid of 2 5s seems reasonable. Alternatively, I could start with 2 4s or 2 0s, but 2 5s utilizes my strongest digit. Opening with 2 5s is a safe, low bid, leaving room for others to raise.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s, which is a relatively low bid and likely true given there are 6 players and 48 total digits. Challenging is risky. My hand contains two 0s. Bidding 3 0s is a valid higher bid (increasing the quantity) and is a reasonable expectation across 6 players, especially since I hold two of them. This seems safer than challenging or bidding on digits I don't hold.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s, and I can bid the same quantity with a higher digit. Bidding 3 6s is safe because I already hold exactly three 6s, guaranteeing the bid holds if challenged.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which means there are at least two more 6s among the other five players (total of 40 digits). Given that the probability of having two more 6s is reasonable, I will make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 7, which I also have one of in my hand. This maintains the quantity but increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit. I have two 8s in my hand, which makes bidding 3 8s a reasonable and safe increase.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 17814653. I have one 8. The current bid is 3 8s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected number of any specific digit is around 48/10 = 4.8.  Bidding 3 8s is plausible, but with only one 8 in my hand, I'm not confident in bidding higher on 8s.  Looking at my hand, I have two 1s. Bidding 4 1s is a stronger bid than 3 8s and is supported by my hand. Alternatively, I have one 7 and one 6, but bidding 4 7s or 4 6s seems less likely to be true across all hands compared to 4 1s, given I have two 1s. Bidding 4 1s is a safe and reasonable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s made by Player 5. Considering my hand (5,1,4,9,0,8,2,5), I have at least two 1s (the '1' and '1' in my hand). Since the total digits are 48, and the previous bid is 4 1s, it's quite plausible that the total count of 1s is at least 4, especially with multiple players. Bidding higher (e.g., 5 1s) seems risky given my hand, but challenging now could be justified if I think the count is less than 4. However, given the previous bids and my hand, I believe the total count could easily be 4 or more. Therefore, the safest move is to challenge the previous bid, as it's not certain that the total number of 1s across all hands is 4 or more.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round. My hand is 17814653. I have two 1s, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 8. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4. Since I have two 1s, a bid of 4 1s is a reasonable starting point, slightly above average and supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have zero 1s in my hand, which makes me consider challenging. However, the previous round's outcome showed the actual count of 1s was 6, which is significantly higher than average and higher than the current bid. This suggests there might still be a higher than average number of 1s among the remaining players. Challenging 4 1s seems risky given this history. My hand contains two 2s. Bidding 4 2s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires 2 more 2s from the other 4 players (32 digits). The average expectation for any digit in 32 digits is 3.2, so requiring 2 is reasonable and supported by my hand. Bidding 4 2s is a safer move than challenging.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s, meaning at least three 2s exist among all players' hands. I have no 2s in my hand. Since there are 24 digits total, and only 3 2s are claimed, this is a reasonable bid. I need to make a strictly higher bid. I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. I have one 4, one 5, one 6, one 8, one 9, and one 1 in my hand. Bidding 3 4s is a valid higher bid with the same quantity but higher digit. This is a safe and logical step to continue the game.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 17814653. The current bid is 3 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. With 3 players and 8 digits each, the expected count of any digit is around 24 / 10 = 2.4. A bid of 3 4s is slightly above average but not unreasonable. However, I have two 1s in my hand, which is above average for me. Bidding 4 1s is a higher quantity than the current bid and I have two 1s to support it, making it a plausible bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s, made by Player 5. I have zero 1s in my hand, which makes challenging a consideration, but 4 is only slightly above the average expected count per digit (2.4), so the bid is not extremely unlikely. My hand contains two 0s, two 2s, one 3, one 4, one 7, and one 8. Player 4 previously bid 3 4s in this round. I have one 4. Player 4's bid suggests they likely hold at least two 4s. If Player 4 has two 4s, and Player 5 has at least one 4, the total count of 4s would be 4 or more. If Player 4 has three or more 4s, the total count is 4 or more regardless of Player 5's hand. Bidding 4 4s is a valid higher bid than 4 1s and is strategically plausible given Player 4's previous bid, leveraging information about their likely hand composition. This seems like a safer and more strategic move than challenging the 4 1s bid.

I have one 4 in my hand, which doesn't strongly support the bid of 4 4s, but I do have one 5 and one 6, which might allow me to bid 4 5s or 4 6s. Bidding 4 5s is a valid higher bid and more plausible than increasing quantity to 5, which might be risky. Therefore, I will bid 4 5s.

Let's reconsider bidding. The current bid is 5 4s. I have one 4. The total digits are 24. The average expected count for any digit is 24 / 10 = 2.4. A bid of 5 is significantly above the average, but not impossible.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s, made by Player 5. There are 24 total digits remaining among 3 players. My hand (07203482) contains one 4. For the bid to be true, the other two players must collectively hold at least four 4s among their 16 digits. Based on probability (Binomial distribution, n=16, p=0.1), the chance of getting 4 or more of a specific digit in 16 random digits is low (around 7%). Therefore, the bid of 5 4s seems unlikely to be true, making a challenge the statistically favorable move.
