Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no previous bids, I need to start with a bid that is reasonable given my hand and the total number of digits. I have 79102947, which includes two 9s, a 7, a 1, a 0, a 2, a 4, and no 3, 5, 6, or 8. Given that I have two 9s and considering the distribution of digits could be somewhat even across players, bidding on a lower digit might be safer but bidding on 9s could be strategic. However, starting with a high digit like 9 might not be the best strategy since it immediately sets a high bar. Instead, I'll consider the digit 1, which I have, and make a conservative bid to start the game, aiming not to overbid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have zero 2s in my hand. Bidding 4 2s would be a lie, and potentially risky. I could challenge, but 3 2s is a relatively low bid and could be plausible. I have one 3, one 4, two 5s, and one 6. Bidding 3 3s would be a valid, slightly higher bid, and I have one 3. Bidding 3 4s is also valid, and I have one 4. Bidding 3 5s is valid and I have two 5s. Bidding 3 6s is valid and I have one 6. However, since I have two 5s, bidding 3 5s seems like the most reasonable option to increase the bid while leveraging my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Challenging 3 5s has only about an 8% chance to succeed, while raising to 3 9s requires just one more 9 among the other 40 cards (over 98% chance). Bidding 3 9s is valid and forces the next player to raise the quantity if they want to continue.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 90204550. I have one 9, three 0s, one 2, one 4, and two 5s. The current bid is 3 9s.  Since I have one 9, and there are 6 players, a bid of 3 9s is plausible but not guaranteed.  However, I have three 0s in my hand. A bid of 4 0s is a higher quantity than the current bid and is well supported by my hand. This seems like a safe and strategic bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, which is a strong showing for the current bid of 4 0s. With 48 digits in play, it's statistically likely there are at least 4 zeros among all hands. Therefore, it's risky to challenge. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Since I have two 5s and two 0s, I could bid 4 5s or 5 0s. Bidding 4 5s keeps the quantity but raises the digit, while bidding 5 0s increases the quantity. Given that 0s are relatively common and I hold two, I will bid 5 0s, which puts pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 0s and my hand 79102947, which contains one 0, I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 players, the maximum number of 0s any player can have is 8. Since I have one 0, it's possible but not guaranteed that the total count of 0s reaches 5. However, bidding higher than 5 0s requires either increasing the quantity, which seems risky given the total available digits, or increasing the digit, which I can consider based on my hand. My hand contains digits 7, 9, 1, 2, 9, 4, 7, which gives me a good spread but no clear indication of a digit being overly abundant. Given the bidding history, players have been cautious, and the jump to 5 0s might be a bluff. I have two 7s and two 9s in my hand, suggesting that higher digits might be more abundant than initially thought. However, challenging the bid of 5 0s seems more strategic at this point because if the total count of 0s is less than 5, I win, and if it's 5 or more, the risk of challenging is worth the potential gain of eliminating a player.

Player 5 Reasoning: It's the start of a new round with 4 players (32 digits). My hand is 38415905, which contains the following digits: 3, 8, 4, 1, 5, 9, 0, 5. I have two 5s, and one each of 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9. Since there is no current bid, I must open. Bidding 2 5s is reasonable, as I hold two 5s myself, making it likely there are more among the 24 unknown digits. This is a safe, conservative opening bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. I hold two 9s, so by bidding 3 9s (same quantity, higher digit) I only need one more 9 among the 24 unknown digits to make the bid true. The probability of at least one 9 in 24 random digits is about 91%. This bid also forces opponents to raise the quantity to 4 if they continue, increasing their risk. Therefore, I should bid 3 9s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand contains one 9 and three 0s. Bidding 4 0s is a valid higher bid and is supported by the three 0s in my hand. Bidding 4 9s seems too risky with only one 9 in my hand. Challenging 3 9s is an option, but with 32 total digits, there could easily be three 9s across the four players. Bidding 4 0s is a safer and more plausible move based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 38415905, which contains two 0s. The current bid is 4 0s. With only 8 digits per player and 4 players (32 digits total), and considering I have 2 of the 0s, the bid requires at least 2 more 0s among the remaining 24 digits (held by 3 players). The expected number of 0s in 24 random digits is about 2.4 (since each digit has a 1 in 10 chance). This makes the bid plausible, but not certain. However, it's early in the round and I can safely make a higher bid by increasing the digit (keeping the quantity the same but moving to a higher digit in my hand), to put pressure on the next player. I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding 4 5s is reasonable.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have only one 5. To meet the bid of five 5s, the other 24 digits must contain at least four more 5s. With an expected ~2.4 and a probability of about 16% to have four or more, this bid seems highly unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 38415905, which contains two 0s. The current bid is 4 0s. With 24 total digits and only 2 0s in my hand, there would need to be 2 more 0s among the other 16 digits held by Players 2 and 4. Statistically, this is plausible, but not guaranteed. However, raising the bid by quantity or digit is safe, and I have a strong count of 5s (two in my hand). Since 5s have already been bid on, and based on previous rounds, 5s have appeared frequently. I will make a higher bid on 5s, as I have two in my hand and the others may have more, making it a credible and safe play.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 90204550. I have three 0s and two 5s. The current bid is 5 5s. With 24 total digits, the average count for any digit is 2.4. A bid of 5 5s is above average and requires a good number of 5s from the other two players.  However, Player 2 just bid 5 5s after Player 5 bid 4 5s and I bid 4 0s. Player 2 won a challenge on 5 5s in the previous round when there were 32 digits, indicating they likely have a good number of 5s.  Challenging seems risky given Player 2's history with 5s.  I need to bid higher than 5 5s.  Bidding 6 0s is possible as I have three 0s, and it's a significant increase in quantity. Bidding 6 5s is also possible given I have two 5s and Player 2 seems to have a good number. Bidding 6 0s is a safer bet based on the digits I know I have.

With 24 digits in play and 2 0s in my hand, the probability that there are 6 or more 0s total is not unreasonable, but it's getting risky. However, since the bid is only at 6, it's plausible someone else also has 2 or more 0s. Challenging now is risky. I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, as I have two 5s in my hand, and 5s have been bid up previously, suggesting others may have them as well.

Seven 5s is a high bid relative to the average, but the previous challenge on 5 5s revealed 7 5s, so it's plausible. I have two 5s.  I also have three 0s. A bid of 7 5s is a quantity of 7 and digit 5. I need to bid higher. I could bid 8 of any digit, or 7 of a digit higher than 5. Bidding 8 0s is possible given my three 0s, but 8 is a high quantity. Bidding 7 6s is also possible. Given the previous history and my hand, bidding 8 0s seems more likely to be true than challenging 7 5s or bidding 7 of a higher digit.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 38415905, which contains two 5s. The current bid is 3 5s. Since I have two 5s, it's plausible that Player 2 has at least one 5, making the bid reasonable. However, I cannot challenge yet since the bid is not obviously impossible, and the rules require me to either raise the bid or challenge. The next valid higher bid would be 3 6s (same quantity, higher digit), but I have only one 6. Alternatively, I can bid 4 0s, as I have two 0s, or 4 5s, but I have only two 5s. The safest aggressive move is to bid 3 9s, as I have one 9, or to increase the quantity on a digit I have multiples of. Given the previous rounds, 5s have been bid up successfully, suggesting Player 2 favors 5s. To diversify and possibly put pressure, I'll bid 3 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 38415905, which contains two 9s. The current bid is 4 9s, meaning there would need to be at least two more 9s in Player 2's hand for the bid to be valid. The probability of Player 2 having two or more 9s in their 8 digits is fairly low (expected is less than 1). Given the risk to Player 2 and my own hand, it's statistically unlikely that there are 4 or more 9s in total. Therefore, I should challenge.
