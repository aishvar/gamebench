Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand and there are 40 unknown digits. Bidding 4 7s means only one more 7 is needed, which is highly likely (~98.6%). This is a strong opening bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Given there are 48 digits total among all players, 4 sevens is reasonable. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity to 5 of any digit or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. I have three 6s and two 3s, but 6 is lower than 7 so I can't bid 4 6s. The next higher digit after 7 is 8, but I have no 8s. Bidding 4 8s might be risky but plausible. Alternatively, bidding 5 3s is a higher quantity but 3 is a low digit, which is allowed. Since I have two 3s, bidding 5 3s might be risky as I only have 2, but the total count could be higher. Bidding 5 7s is also possible and safer since the digit stays the same but quantity increases. I have one 7, so 5 7s might be a good bid to pressure others. Therefore, I will bid 5 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to evaluate the current bid of 5 7s made by Player 1. Looking at my hand (61448029), I don't have any 7s. With 6 players having 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For the bid of 5 7s to be valid, about 10.4% of all digits would need to be 7s, which is slightly higher than the expected 10% for random distribution. Since I don't have any 7s in my hand, all 5 would need to be among the other 40 digits held by other players. This is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's a risky move this early in the game. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 8s in my hand, so bidding on 8s gives me some confidence. I'll bid 5 8s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 27891756, which contains one 8. The current bid is 5 8s by Player 2. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the bid of 5 8s is relatively low and plausible, as it represents only about 10% of the total digits. I don't have strong evidence to challenge this bid since I contribute one 8 myself, and it's reasonable that other players could have a few more. Instead of challenging, I will make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 5 8s, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. I have two 7s in my hand, but since 7 is lower than 8, I cannot bid on 7s with the same quantity. I will bid 6 8s to increase the quantity while staying on a digit I have at least one of, making my bid slightly more believable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. My hand contains two 9s, which supports a bid on 9s. Bidding 6 9s maintains the same quantity but increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid. Since I have two 9s, it's plausible that the total across all players meets this bid, especially compared to the original 8s where I have none. This is a safer move than challenging, which risks elimination if the bid is correct.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 6 9s and considering the total number of digits remaining (48), it's essential to assess the likelihood of higher bids. Since the current bid is already at a high digit (9), increasing the quantity is the most feasible way to make a higher bid. However, considering the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48 and there are 6 players with 8 digits each, bidding a higher quantity of 9s might be risky. Instead, looking at my hand (58560244), I notice I have multiple 5s and other digits, but no 9s. Given that the bid needs to be strictly higher, and challenging seems risky without more information, I should consider the distribution of digits. Since I have no 9s and making a significantly higher bid might not be believable, I need to decide between challenging the current bid or making a strategic bid. Considering the game's progression and the fact that I don't have any 9s, challenging might be a safer option, especially since the current bid is quite high and specific to the digit 9, which might not be as common as other digits. However, without clear insight into other players' hands, the safest strategic move, given the information and the need to make a 'higher' bid, would be to either challenge or bid on a different digit if I had enough information to support such a bid. Given these considerations and the fact that I don't have enough information to confidently make a higher bid, challenging the current bid seems like the most cautious approach, considering the risk of elimination for making an incorrect bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None' and I have to make a bid that is strictly higher, I need to consider my hand and the total possible digits. My hand contains 58560244, which has multiple instances of the digit 5 and other digits. Since the goal is to make a valid higher bid and considering the distribution of my hand, bidding on a digit I have multiple of seems like a good starting point. The digit 5 appears twice in my hand, and given that there are 40 total digits remaining, it's plausible that there could be at least a few more 5s among the other players. Thus, bidding on 5s seems reasonable. However, I must also consider the maximum possible quantity for any digit, which is 40, and the fact that I'm starting the bidding, so I should start with a quantity that is reasonable and has a good chance of being correct without being too high.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s, so raising to 4 7s is a valid increase in quantity. I only need at least one more 7 among the 32 unknown digits, which is highly likely (P≈97%). This is a strong, safe bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. Player 1 has bid 4 8s, which means they believe there are at least 4 8s among all players. Since I have 1 of them, there would need to be 3 more among the other 4 players. This is certainly possible, but not guaranteed. I could challenge, but it's a risky move at this early stage. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 4s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 4s. However, I need to make a higher bid than '4 8s'. I could bid '5 4s', which increases the quantity, or I could bid '5 8s', which increases the quantity while keeping the same digit. Since I only have 1 eight, I'll go with '5 4s' as I have more personal knowledge about the frequency of 4s.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 27891756, which contains no 4s. The current bid is 5 4s by Player 2. With 40 total digits across 5 players, an average of 4 of each digit is expected. A bid of 5 4s is slightly above average but not unreasonable. However, since I have no 4s, the likelihood of 5 4s existing depends heavily on the other players. I could challenge, but it's risky as 5 4s is plausible. Instead, I'll make a higher bid of 5 5s, as it's the minimal increase (same quantity, higher digit), and I have one 5 in my hand, making it slightly more believable to me. This also avoids an immediate challenge risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 5s by Player 3, I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge. Looking at my hand, 58560244, I have three 5s. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 40 and there are 5 players, the maximum number of any digit can be is 40. Since I already have three 5s, it's plausible that there could be at least 5 5s in total, given that each player has 8 digits. However, bidding higher than 5 5s requires careful consideration. A safe increment would be to bid on a higher digit with the same quantity or increase the quantity of the same digit. Given my hand and the fact that I've seen bids for higher digits (like 7s, 8s, and 9s) earlier, which were not extremely high, I should consider what's likely to exist in higher quantities. Since I have no 6s, 7s, 8s, or 9s in my hand and considering the previous bids, making a bid for a higher digit seems risky without more information. However, I do have a significant number of 5s and 2s, but bidding on 2s might not be strategic given their low value. Challenging the bid of 5 5s could be an option if I thought it was highly unlikely, but given I have three 5s myself, it seems possible there could be two more 5s among the other players, making the challenge risky. Given these considerations, the safest strategic move seems to be to increase the quantity of a digit I have knowledge of, which is the 5, but since I need to bid higher than 5 5s and I don't have enough information to safely bid on a higher digit with the same quantity, I must consider the next logical step carefully.

Player 0 Reasoning: I hold three 7s in my hand. To meet a bid of 6 7s I need only three more among the other 39 unknown digits. The probability of at least three 7s in 39 random digits is about 75%, making this a strong, valid raise (same quantity, higher digit than 6 5s).

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I must bid higher, either by increasing quantity or keeping quantity at 6 and increasing digit. I have one 7 in my hand and one 6, but no 8s or higher digits of the same quantity. Bidding 6 8s is the next valid higher bid. Since 6 7s is already quite high and I only have one 7, it is risky to bid higher, but bidding 6 8s is the minimal valid increase and plausible given the total digits. Challenging now might be premature as the bid is not extremely high yet.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 6 8s across all players' hands. That means there need to be at least 5 more 8s among the other 4 players, which is an average of 1.25 8s per player. This seems plausible but not certain. Looking at the bidding pattern, Player 1 increased from 4 8s to 6 8s after a few rounds, suggesting they might have multiple 8s. However, I have a lot of 4s (two of them) in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 4s. I'll bid 7 4s, increasing the quantity while using a digit I have multiple of.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 27891756, which contains no 4s. The current bid is 7 4s by Player 2. With 40 total digits across 5 players, a bid of 7 4s means that there should be at least 7 instances of the digit 4 in all hands combined. Since I have zero 4s, the other 4 players must account for all 7. This averages to about 1.75 4s per player, which is plausible but on the higher side given that digits are typically distributed somewhat evenly. Looking at the bidding history, bids have been increasing steadily, and Player 2 escalated from 6 8s to 7 4s, which might be a bluff to push the quantity higher. However, challenging carries a risk since 7 out of 40 is only 17.5%, and it's not extremely unlikely. I could bid higher, such as 7 5s, since I have one 5 in my hand, and the previous bid of 6 5s suggests there might be some 5s out there. This seems safer than challenging a bid that is statistically possible. Therefore, I will bid 7 5s to stay in the game and test the waters.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 7 5s and my hand containing multiple 5s (58560244), I must assess the likelihood of this bid being true. Since I have three 5s in my hand and there are 40 total digits remaining across all players, it's possible that the total count of 5s could be around or slightly above 7, considering other players might also have 5s. However, without exact information on other players' hands, making a higher bid requires careful consideration. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40 and we are already at a bid of 7 5s, increasing the quantity further might be risky. On the other hand, challenging the bid could be a viable option if I believe the actual count of 5s is less than 7. Since my hand contributes significantly to the count of 5s and I'm not certain about the distribution in other players' hands, I will choose to make a bid that increases the quantity, as it seems more strategic to push the bid higher with a digit that I have a good amount of, rather than immediately challenging.

Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (61448029), I have two 8s. Player 1 has bid 4 8s, meaning they believe there are at least 4 8s among all players. Since I have 2 of them, there would need to be at least 2 more 8s between Player 0 and Player 1 for this bid to be valid. This is certainly possible. Player 1 might have seen my previous bid of 5 8s in an earlier round and inferred I have some 8s. I could bid 5 8s, but that might be risky if there aren't actually 5 8s total. I could also bid 4 9s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Looking at my hand, I have one 9, so bidding 4 9s seems reasonable. I'll go with that.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand. There are 24 digits total, 8 in my hand and 16 unknown. The chance of seeing at least four 9s in the 16 unknown (Binomial(16,0.1)) is only about 7%. Challenging 4 9s is very likely to win.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold three 7s in my hand and there are only two players, so there are at least three 7s total. Bidding 3 7s is the highest guaranteed safe bid, forcing my opponent to make a riskier raise or lose if they challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Given there are 16 digits total, having at least 3 sevens is plausible. I can increase the bid by either raising the quantity or the digit. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid and reasonable since I have no 8s, but it is only one digit higher and same quantity. Bidding 4 0s would be a higher quantity but I have no 0s to support that. Bidding 3 8s is a safe incremental raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have only one 8 in my hand. For the bid of 3 8s to be true, my opponent must have at least two 8s in their eight cards. The probability of that is under 20%, so it’s unlikely the bid is valid. I should challenge.
