Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid. My hand is 39385387, which contains three 3s. There are 6 players in total, with 48 digits. The average count for any digit is 4.8. Bidding '4 3s' is slightly higher than my personal count (three 3s) but is close to the expected average count across all 48 digits. It requires only one more 3 among the other 40 digits, which is very likely. This seems like a reasonable and plausible starting bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The average number of any specific digit across all players is 4.8, making a bid of 4 5s statistically plausible. Since this bid (same quantity, higher digit) is strictly higher than the current bid of 4 3s, it follows the rules and leverages my hand's composition.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my eight-digit hand. To beat the current bid of 4 5s I can either keep the quantity at 4 but raise the digit, or raise the quantity. Bidding 5 7s both increases the quantity and uses a digit I already hold in abundance. Across the remaining 40 hidden digits, the expected number of 7s is about 4, so I need only 2 more to reach 5, which has roughly a 92% chance of being true. This is a strong, safe advance that puts pressure on the next players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 5 7s, which means there would need to be at least four more 7s among the other five players (total of 40 digits). The probability of having four 7s in 40 digits is relatively low, but not impossible. However, since I only have one 7, I might challenge this bid. But to be safe, I could also bid 5 8s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Given that I have an 8 in my hand, this seems like a reasonable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand of 19253942, I only have one 8. With 6 players total and 8 digits each (48 total digits), the claim of five 8s seems plausible but risky. Given that I only see one 8 in my hand, that means there would need to be at least 4 more 8s among the other 40 digits (10%). While possible, this seems unlikely enough to warrant a challenge, especially since the bid is getting high and the digit (8) is also high, making it harder for the next player to make a safe higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and have a good view of my hand. I see two 9s, which is a high digit. With 5 players having 8 digits each (40 total), starting with a conservative bid like 3 9s is strategic - it's likely there's at least one more 9 among the other 32 digits I can't see, and the high digit (9) makes it harder for others to bid over without increasing quantity.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have 6s in my hand, so I can safely increase the digit to 6. The current bid is 3 9s, so I'll increase the quantity to 4 as well.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand contains zero 6s. While 4 is the average expected count for 40 digits, challenging is risky as it's a plausible number for the other players to collectively hold. My hand contains three 3s. Bidding 5 3s is a valid higher bid that leverages my strong hand in 3s and requires only 2 more 3s from the remaining 32 digits among the other players, which is a reasonable expectation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid of 5 3s requires at least 5 threes across all 5 players. With only 1 three in my hand and the average count per digit being ~4 (40 total digits / 10 possible digits), the bid is above average. Given that previous bids of similar magnitude (e.g., 5 8s) were invalidated, challenging seems favorable. The required 4 additional threes in the remaining 32 digits (from other players) is statistically unlikely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It is the start of a new round, and I am the first to bid. There are 4 players with 8 digits each, totaling 32 digits. The expected average count for any digit is 32 / 10 = 3.2. My hand contains three 3s. Bidding 4 3s is a reasonable starting bid, slightly above the expected average, and well supported by the three 3s I hold.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I hold three 7s (27279766). To satisfy a bid of 4 7s, only one more 7 needs to be present among the 24 unknown digits held by the other three players. Randomly, 24 digits would be expected to contain about 2–3 sevens, so the chance that there is at least one is very high (over 90%). Bidding 4 7s is strictly higher than the current bid of 4 3s (same quantity, higher digit) and keeps the risk of an immediate challenge low.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: In my hand of 19253942, I have one 7. The current bid is 4 7s. With 32 total digits and 4 players, each having 8 digits, finding 3 more 7s among the other players seems plausible. However, given that Player 2 didn't increase the quantity from the previous bid of 4 3s (only changed the digit), they might be bluffing. Since I only have one 7 and would need three more to exist, I think challenging is the safer option rather than having to bid 5 of something or 4 of a higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I am the first to act this round, so I must make a bid. I hold three 7s (27279766). With 16 unknown digits in the other two hands, the expected additional number of 7s is about 1.6, making it very likely there is at least one more 7. A bid of 4 7s is therefore statistically safe and raises the bar enough to pressure the other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. My hand contains one 9. With 24 total digits among 3 players, there are 16 digits hidden from me. For the bid of 4 9s to be true, the other two players must hold at least 3 9s among their 16 digits (since I have 1). The expected number of any digit in 16 random digits is 1.6. The probability of having 3 or more 9s in 16 digits is approximately 21.1% (calculated using Binomial distribution P(X>=3 | n=16, p=0.1)). This means there is approximately a 78.9% chance that the other players have fewer than 3 9s, making the total count of 9s less than 4 and the bid false. Challenging this bid gives me a high probability of winning. My alternative is to bid higher, which requires bidding 5 of any digit. Based on my hand (three 3s, two 8s, one 9, one 5, one 7), the least risky bid would be 5 3s (requires 2 more 3s from 16 digits, ~48.6% chance of being true if challenged). Challenging 4 9s is significantly more likely to succeed than any possible bid I can make being true if challenged. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have 9, 3, 6, 7, 6, 4 in my hand. The current bid is None. I don't have any information about the other player's hand, but I can start with a reasonable bid based on my own hand. I have two 6s, so I'll bid on that digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold exactly two 6s, so the current bid of 2 6s is certainly satisfied; challenging would be an automatic loss for me. To stay in the game I must raise the bid. I also hold three 7s, so a bid of 3 7s is guaranteed to be true even if my opponent has no 7s at all. This makes it a safe and strictly higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s, and I have a 6 in my hand. Given the relatively small total digits remaining (16), I should increase both quantity and digit to make a higher bid. Bidding 4 8s seems plausible, as it's a higher digit than 7 and a higher quantity than 3.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand. For the bid of 4 8s to be valid, all four (or more) must come from Player 5’s eight unknown digits. The chance of them holding at least four 8s out of eight digits is well under 1%, while they could just as easily have made a safer bid based on a digit they actually see. This bid is almost certainly an over-reach, so challenging gives me an overwhelming likelihood of winning the round.
