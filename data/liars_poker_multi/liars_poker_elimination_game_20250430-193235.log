Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made, I can start with a reasonable bid. I have two 8s and one 9 in my hand. Bidding 3 8s is a conservative start, as it's likely there are at least three 8s among all players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. With 48 total digits, the expected average count for any digit is 4.8. A bid of 3 is below average and statistically likely to be true, even though I hold zero 8s. Challenging seems risky. My hand is 65575421, containing three 5s. Bidding based on my hand is a strong strategy. A bid of '4 5s' is higher than '3 8s'. Since I have three 5s, we only need one more 5 among the remaining 40 digits held by other players for this bid to be true, which is statistically very probable (estimated probability > 98%). Therefore, bidding 4 5s is a safe and logical next step.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s. Bidding 4 8s is valid as it maintains the same quantity (4) but increases the digit (8 > 5). Given my strong holding in 8s and the bid being below the average expected count for a digit (4.8), this bid is credible and pressures others.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. Across 48 digits we’d expect about 4 more fives among the other cards, so a total of at least 5 fives is plausible. Raising from 4 8s to 5 5s is a valid and reasonably safe move.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:4 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 4s, two 0s, one 9, one 3, one 7, and one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 5 5s. There are 6 players, meaning 48 total digits. On average, each digit should appear about 4.8 times (48 / 10). Player 3's bid of 5 5s is slightly above average, but not excessively so. Looking at my hand, I don't have any 5s, which makes me slightly more skeptical of a high number of 5s. However, challenging at 5 5s could be risky if other players have a few 5s. My hand has two 4s and two 0s. Bidding 6 0s or 6 4s would be a reasonable increase in quantity and is supported by my hand. Bidding 6 0s seems slightly safer as 0s are generally less bid upon early. Bidding 6 4s is also supported by my hand. Bidding 6 0s is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '6 0s' made by Player 4. Looking at my hand (77949292), I don't have any 0s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For there to be 6 zeros, the other 5 players would need to have an average of 1.2 zeros each, which is certainly possible. However, the bidding has been escalating quickly, and Player 4 might be bluffing. Given that I have two 9s in my hand, I could bid '6 9s', keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to 7 with a lower digit. Since I have two 2s, I could bid '7 2s'. Between these options, '6 9s' seems safer as it requires fewer digits from other players. I'll go with that.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. In my hand, I have two 9s. Given that the previous bids have been relatively moderate, it seems unlikely that there are 6 9s in total. Additionally, the bid history shows that higher digits have not been bid frequently. Therefore, challenging the bid seems like a good strategy.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In the previous round, there were 5 9s revealed, leaving at most 4 9s remaining. Since I have one 9, there could be up to 3 more 9s among the remaining players. Bidding 4 9s is risky, but it's a strategic move to pressure other players. If challenged, I can potentially eliminate a player. Alternatively, bidding 5 6s is a safer option, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity reasonable, as I have two 6s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (65575421). This means there need to be at least four more 6s among the remaining 32 digits held by the other 4 players. The expected number of 6s across all 40 digits is 4. The bid of 5 is slightly above average but plausible. However, I have three 5s in my hand. Bidding 6 5s requires only three more 5s among the other 32 digits. The expected number of 5s in those 32 digits is 3.2. Bidding 6 5s leverages my strong hand in 5s and is statistically well-supported, making it a better option than challenging the plausible 5 6s bid or making a riskier bid on another digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid of 6 5s requires at least 6 fives in total. With 40 digits across 5 players and my hand containing zero 5s, the expected number of 5s in the remaining 32 digits is ~3.2. This makes the bid of 6 5s highly unlikely, especially since the average total for any digit is 4. Challenging this bid is statistically favorable given the low probability of the bid being true.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. Starting the round, bidding 4 8s is reasonable as it's likely at least one more 8 exists among the other players' hands. This bid leverages my strong holding in 8s while staying conservative given the reduced player pool.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. Bidding 4 8s is reasonable because the expected total of 8s across all three players (including mine) is likely higher than 4, given the statistical distribution. This bid leverages my strong holding in 8s and forces opponents to either challenge or raise the stakes.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the average count per digit is 2.4. A bid of 4 8s is slightly above average, but not excessively so, especially considering the previous round had 7 eights with 32 total digits. Challenging might be risky if Player 2 has multiple 8s. I need to make a higher bid. I have two 0s, one 3, one 4, one 7, one 8, and one 9. Bidding 5 0s is a reasonable increase based on my hand and the probability of other players having 0s.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. The current bid is 5 0s, which is a reasonable bid. However, I have two 8s in my hand, and the previous bid was 4 8s. Bidding 5 8s increases the digit and maintains the quantity, making it a strong bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have four 8s in my hand. The current bid of 5 8s requires at least one more 8 in the remaining two players' combined hands. Since Player 0 made the bid, they likely hold at least one 8, making the total count at least 5. Challenging would risk elimination if the count meets or exceeds 5. Bidding 6 8s leverages my strong holding in 8s and forces opponents to either challenge or raise further, which could be advantageous if the actual count is 6 or higher.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. My hand has two 8s. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the average count for any digit is 2.  A bid of 6 8s seems possible, but not extremely likely.  Given my two 8s, it's plausible there are a few more among the other two players.  Bidding 7 8s would be a significant jump, but a bid of 7 of a lower digit like 7 0s or 7 3s is even less likely given my hand. I have two 0s and one 3.  Bidding 7 8s is the most reasonable higher bid based on my hand and the current bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Player 4 has bid aggressively on 8s, suggesting they might have a few 8s. However, with only 24 digits remaining, 7 8s seems plausible. Bidding 8 6s is a reasonable move, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity modest, given the remaining digits and the history of aggressive bidding on 8s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid of 8 6s requires at least 8 sixes across all three players. I have only one 6 in my hand, and given the prior focus on 8s (with bids reaching 7 8s), it's plausible that other players also prioritized 8s, leaving fewer digits for sixes. The expected total sixes in 24 digits is around 2.4, making 8 sixs highly unlikely. Challenging this bid carries a risk, but the probability of the bid being false seems high enough to justify the challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have four 8s in my hand, making 8s the most prominent digit. Bidding 4 8s is a safe starting point because even if Player 4 has zero 8s, the total would still be 4 (all from my hand), ensuring the bid holds if challenged. This forces Player 4 to bid higher or switch digits, giving me strategic control.
