Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With 48 total digits across all players, the expected count for any digit is around 4.8. Bidding four 8s is a reasonable starting point since the actual count is likely to meet or exceed this bid, leveraging my knowledge of having two 8s already.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s, which is close to the average expected count (4.8 for 48 digits across 6 players). Challenging this bid is risky, especially since I hold one 8 myself. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 5s. Bidding 5 5s increases the quantity from 4 to 5 and is a valid higher bid. Based on my two 5s, this bid requires only three additional 5s from the other 5 players (40 digits total), which is less than the average expectation of four 5s among them. This makes 5 5s a plausible and reasonably safe bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Bidding 6 5s would be a lie, and I don't want to risk being the first to challenge a potentially truthful bid. I could bid a higher digit with a quantity of 5 or more, but I don't have enough of any other digit to confidently do so. I have two 2s, one 6, one 9, one 0, and one 1. Bidding 5 6s seems reasonable as I have one 6, and it's a higher digit than 5. This is a slight bluff, but plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total), and Player 2 claiming there are at least 5 sixes, this seems somewhat high but not impossible. Since I have one 6, there would need to be 4 more 6s among the other 40 digits (10%). While this is possible, it's getting into risky territory. However, making a higher bid would be even riskier. The next valid bid would need to be either 6 6s (very unlikely) or 5 7s or higher (also unlikely since I see no 7s in my hand). Given these factors, challenging is the safer play.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None'. I have two 6s in my hand, and the previous round involved 5s and 6s. Bidding 1 7s is a safe and reasonable starting bid, increasing the digit from the previous round. It's a small bid to gauge the other players' hands without risking too much.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (the last digit). Since the bid is very low, I can safely increase the bid. The next higher bid could be 1 8s or 2 0s. I don't have any 8s, but I do have multiple 4s, so bidding on 4s might be more plausible later. For now, bidding 1 8s is a minimal increase and safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (93679361), I have one 8 digit. The current bid is '1 8s' made by Player 4. Since I already have one 8 in my hand, and there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total digits), it's very likely that there is at least one more 8 among the other players. I could safely bid '2 8s'. Alternatively, I could increase the digit and bid '1 9s', which would also be a valid higher bid. Since I have two 9s in my hand, bidding '2 9s' would be even safer. Given my confidence in having multiple 9s, I'll bid '2 9s' to establish a stronger position.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, making a bid of 3 5s plausible. The current bid of 2 9s requires a higher quantity bid, and 3 of any digit qualifies. Given my possession of two 5s, it's reasonable to assume at least one more 5 exists among the remaining 32 digits (40 total - my 8 digits). Challenging 2 9s is risky since the expected count of 9s in 40 digits is ~4, and even with my lack of 9s, the remaining digits could still meet or exceed the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s by Player 0. Challenging 3 5s when I hold two 5s is very risky, as it's likely at least one other 5 exists among the remaining 32 digits held by other players. Therefore, I must make a higher bid. Bidding 4 5s is a valid higher bid (increasing the quantity). This bid requires only two additional 5s among the other 4 players, which is a statistically plausible number given 32 remaining digits. This leverages my hand strength in 5s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 5s is necessary. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 5s seems risky. Increasing the digit to 4 6s is a viable option, as I have two 6s. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move given my hand and the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, which makes the bid plausible but not guaranteed. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. I have three 4s and two 6s, but no 7s or higher digits. Bidding 4 7s would be a higher digit at the same quantity, which might be risky since I have no 7s. Increasing the quantity to 5 with digit 0 or higher seems safer. I have one 0, so bidding 5 0s is a valid and reasonably safe next bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (93679361), I have 0 zeros. Player 4 has bid 5 0s, meaning they believe there are at least 5 zeros among all 40 digits. Since I have none, all 5 would need to be in the other players' hands. This is possible but not highly probable. With 5 players having 8 digits each, the expected count of any digit would be around 4. I could challenge, but it's risky since 5 zeros across 32 digits (excluding my hand) is plausible. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 9s in my hand, so I'm confident in bidding 5 9s, which is higher than 5 0s because the digit is higher while maintaining the same quantity.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. My hand contains no 9s, and the average expected count for any digit (including 9s) across 40 total digits is 4. Given that I have 0 9s, the remaining 32 digits (other players) would need at least 5 9s for the bid to hold, which is statistically unlikely (probability ~22%). Challenging seems favorable as the actual count is likely below 5.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. Starting the round with a bid of 3 5s leverages my known digits and assumes at least one more 5 exists among the remaining 24 digits (3 players × 8 digits). This is a moderate opening bid that balances confidence and risk, as 3 is well below the maximum possible quantity (32) and aligns with prior bidding patterns involving 5s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. My hand contains two 5s. With 32 total digits, the expected count for any digit is around 3.2. The current bid is plausible, and challenging is risky given I hold two 5s, making it likely the total count is 3 or more. I need to make a higher bid. Bidding 4 5s is a natural escalation from 3 5s and leverages the fact that I hold two 5s, making the bid of 4 more likely to be true than if I held zero 5s. I need 2 more 5s from the other 3 players (24 digits), which is close to the expected count (2.4).

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have one 5 in my hand, and there are 32 digits total. Given that 5 5s is a moderate bid, increasing it to 6 0s is a valid and safer increment since 0s are common and I have one in my hand. Bidding 6 0s is a valid higher bid and puts pressure on others.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, and the previous bids focused on 5s. Bidding 6 5s is a valid higher bid than 6 0s (same quantity but higher digit) and leverages my knowledge of my own digits. This seems plausible given the history and my hand composition.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. My hand contains two 5s, two 1s, two 2s, one 8, and one 9. There are 32 total digits. A bid of 6 is high, representing 6/32 (18.75%) of the total digits, compared to the expected 10%. Based on my hand, 6 5s requires 4 or more 5s among the other 24 digits, which has a probability of about 20.4%. While challenging is an option with a good chance of winning (approx 80% based on probability), the sequence of bids on 5s (3, 4, 5, 6) suggests that other players might also hold 5s, making the bid more plausible. Instead of challenging, I can make a valid higher bid. Bidding 6 of a digit I have multiple of is a strong defensive move. I have two 1s and two 2s. Bidding 6 1s requires 4 or more 1s in the remaining 24 digits, which also has a probability of about 20.4%. This bid is statistically as likely as the current bid being true (from my perspective) and is a valid increase (same quantity, higher digit than 6 0s, which was the previous bid before Player 0's 6 5s). It puts the pressure on the next player without taking the immediate risk of a challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. I hold two 5s in my hand. For the bid to be true, there must be at least four additional 5s among the other 3 players (24 total digits). Assuming a random distribution, the probability of having 4 or more 5s in 24 digits (each with a 1/10 chance of being a 5) is approximately 20.86%. This implies there is about a 79.14% chance that the total count of 5s is less than 6. Based on this low probability of the bid being accurate, challenging is the statistically favored move.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid of 4 6s requires at least four 6s across all three players' hands. With only 24 total digits remaining and the average expected count for any digit being ~2.4, a bid of 4 6s is statistically unlikely.
