Player 0 Reasoning: It's the first round, and no one has bid yet. I have a 9 in my hand. To make a valid bid, I should start with a small quantity and a high digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '1 9s' and my hand '15675887', I notice I don't have any 9s. However, to make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I have two 7s and two 8s, and considering the total number of digits remaining is 48, bidding on these digits could be reasonable. But, without knowing the distribution of other players' hands, it's a bit risky to bid high. Given my hand and the need to make a strictly higher bid, I could consider bidding on a digit I have in abundance or try to challenge if the current bid seems unlikely. However, challenging '1 9s' might not be the best move since it's a relatively low bid and there could easily be at least one 9 among all players. Thus, making a bid that increases either the quantity or the digit seems like a safer strategy. Since I don't have any 9s but have multiple 7s and 8s, and given that bidding on a higher digit is also considered a higher bid, I can consider these options.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 63435471, which contains one 7. The current bid is 2 7s by Player 1. With 6 players and 48 total digits, it's plausible that there are at least two 7s across all hands, especially since I have one. I don't think challenging is wise at this low bid level. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Since I have two 4s in my hand, bidding 3 4s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and changes the digit. However, to be more conservative and strategic, I'll bid 3 7s to stay on the same digit but increase the quantity, testing if others believe there are more 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding higher requires me to estimate the number of 7s other players might have. Since I have no 7s, it's likely the bid is an overestimation. Given the relatively low quantity, challenging seems like a reasonable risk. A successful challenge would eliminate Player 2.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet in this round and I am starting the bidding, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand is 63435471, which contains two 3s, two 4s, one 1, one 5, one 6, and one 7. Bidding on 3s or 4s seems reasonable as I already have two of each. I will bid 3 4s to start with a moderate quantity and a digit I have some confidence in, leaving room for others to bid higher while not overextending early in the round.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s made by Player 2. I have 8 secret digits: 52408868. I count two 4s and two 8s, and other digits are 5, 2, 0, 6. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 40 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Since my hand contains two 4s, and there could be more 4s in other players' hands, bidding a higher quantity seems risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding 4 4s would be a straightforward increase in quantity. But considering my hand and possible higher digits, bidding 3 5s or higher digit with same quantity might be strategic. But to be safe and considering my hand, I should challenge if I think it's unlikely or bid reasonably.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have a 5 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I could increase the quantity or the digit. However, I don't have any higher digits in my hand, so I'll increase the quantity to 5. This is a reasonable bid based on my hand and the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 5s and my hand containing one 5 and other digits, I must decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Since my hand has one 5, and considering the total number of digits remaining is 40, it's possible that there are at least 5 fives among all players. However, bidding higher than 5 5s requires careful consideration. A higher bid could be increasing the quantity (e.g., 6 5s) or increasing the digit (e.g., 5 6s). Given my hand, I have two 7s and one 8, which could support a bid for a higher digit if I choose to keep the quantity the same. But, without knowing the exact distribution of other players' hands, any bid higher than 5 5s involves risk. Since I have one 5, one 6, one 7 (twice), one 8, and one 9 (none of which directly supports a bid of 5 5s or higher without more information), challenging seems like a viable option. But, considering the potential for other players to have multiple 5s, and given that I do not have enough information to confidently challenge the bid of 5 5s, making a strategic bid seems more appropriate. Given my hand and the fact that I need to make a higher bid, I could consider bidding on a digit I have more of or a higher digit. Since I have two 7s and one 8, and considering the need to bid higher, I could consider bidding on 6s or 7s if I had enough, but since I don't have enough to confidently bid higher on those, and given that I must bid higher than 5 5s, I should look for a digit that could reasonably have a higher count. Given the constraints and my hand, I should consider what digits are more likely to appear in higher quantities across all players and make my decision based on that.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 63435471, which contains one 6. The current bid is 5 6s by Player 1. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, an average of 4 of each digit is expected across all hands. I only have one 6, which means the other 4 players must collectively have at least 4 more 6s to meet the bid. This is possible but not highly likely given the distribution. However, since the bid is still relatively low compared to the total digits, I’ll avoid challenging and instead make a higher bid. I’ll bid 6 6s, increasing the quantity slightly, as it’s a reasonable escalation and keeps the pressure on others to either challenge or bid higher. I could switch to a higher digit, but I’ll stick with 6s since I have one in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s made by Player 2. I have 2 sixes in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are 40 digits in total. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. I should assess the likelihood of there being 6 or more 6s. Since I only have 2 sixes and there are 4 other players, it's possible but not certain that there are 6 or more 6s in total. I will bid higher than 6 6s by increasing the quantity because I don't have a high digit to increase it that way. A bid of 7 6s seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand. Given the current bid of 2 1s and considering the total number of digits remaining is 32, it seems plausible that there could be at least two 1s among all players. However, without more information about the other players' hands and given that I only have one 1, I should consider making a bid that is reasonably higher. Since I don't have enough information to confidently challenge, and given the low quantity of the current bid, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Looking at my hand, I see I have two 7s and other higher digits, but increasing the digit might be risky without knowing the distribution. Thus, increasing the quantity of a lower digit or matching the digit with a higher quantity seems safer. Considering my hand and the goal to make a higher bid, bidding on a digit I have more of or seems more plausible could be a good strategy.

With 32 total digits across 4 players, it's plausible that there are at least 3 1s in play, especially since I have one. I don't think challenging is wise here as the bid seems reasonable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Since I have two 3s and two 4s, bidding on 4s seems like a safe bet to increase the quantity. I'll bid 4 4s, which is higher than 3 1s in both quantity and digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 63435471, which gives me two 3s, two 4s, one 1, one 5, one 6, and one 7. With 24 total digits across three players, I can make a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 3 4s seems reasonable, as I already have two 4s, and it's likely there is at least one more 4 among the other 16 digits. This keeps the bid low enough to avoid an early challenge while starting the round.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s made by Player 2. I have 9 in my hand, which is the highest digit I have. Considering the total digits remaining is 24, a reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity and digit, but since I have no other 4s, I should bid a higher digit. I also consider the previous bids, and no one has bid a higher quantity or digit than 3 4s yet. Therefore, I should bid 3 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 5s by Player 0 and considering my hand 15675887, which contains no 5s but has a variety of other digits, I must decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Since my hand does not provide a clear advantage for bidding on a higher quantity of a specific digit, and considering the total digits remaining is 24, I should be cautious. Bidding higher without sufficient information from my hand could be risky. However, challenging the bid of 3 5s could be a good strategy if I believe the actual count of 5s across all players is less than 3. Given that I have no 5s and the game has progressed significantly, reducing the total number of digits, it's plausible that the count of 5s might not meet the bid, especially since no player has bid on 5s previously in a way that suggests a high abundance of 5s. Thus, challenging seems like a reasonable move, leveraging the uncertainty and the potential that the actual count of 5s might be lower than bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 63435471, which contains two 5s. The current bid by Player 0 is 8 5s, meaning they are claiming there are at least 8 fives across our combined 16 digits. Since I only have two 5s, Player 0 would need to have at least 6 fives in their 8-digit hand for the bid to be true. This seems unlikely, as having 6 or more of a single digit in an 8-digit hand is statistically rare. With only two players left and a total of 16 digits, a bid of 8 is very high—representing 50% of all digits being 5s. I believe this bid is a bluff. Therefore, challenging seems like the better option rather than making a higher bid like 9 5s or switching to a different digit, as I don't have strong counts in other digits to confidently bid higher.
