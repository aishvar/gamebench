Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first to act. In my hand I already have two 7s. With 40 unknown digits among the other five players, the chance that at least two more 7s are present is high (well over 90% if digits are uniformly distributed). Opening with 4 7s is therefore safe for me while setting a respectable bar for the table; opponents can only keep the same quantity with 8s or 9s, or else they must raise the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 7s' and my hand '52790061', I notice I don't have any 7s. However, I should consider the total possible count of 7s across all players and the likelihood of the current bid being true. Since there are 48 digits in total and 6 players, each having 8 digits, it's possible but not highly probable for there to be exactly 4 or more 7s without any additional information. Considering I don't have any 7s, challenging seems like a reasonable option, but I must also think about making a higher bid. A higher bid could be increasing the quantity or the digit. Given that my hand contains a couple of high digits, I could consider bidding on one of those if I think the quantity could be reasonable. However, without specific knowledge of other players' hands, it's a gamble. Since the current bid is on the lower end of possible quantities (considering the maximum is 48), and I don't have personal evidence to support or refute the existence of 4 or more 7s, I must weigh the risk of challenging versus bidding higher. Given these considerations and aiming to make a strategic move, I decide to challenge the current bid as it seems risky to immediately increase the bid without more information.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 7s. In the previous round there were 7 total 7s among 48 digits. With only one player's 8 digits now gone, statistical likelihood still suggests at least five 7s remain among the 40 current digits (≈90% chance). Starting the round with 5 7s is a solid, defensible opening bid that leverages my hand while being hard to challenge outright.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and Player 0 has shown confidence in 7s by bidding them twice. Their first bid of 4 7s was proven true with 7 actual 7s found. Now they're bidding 5 7s. Given I have two 7s, and Player 0's previous accurate bid suggests they likely have multiple 7s as well, this bid of 5 7s is quite plausible. It would be risky to challenge. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Since 7s seem common, I'll increase to 6 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. While I have a 7 in my hand, I do not have enough information to confidently bid higher. However, considering that Player 0 and Player 2 have already bid high on 7s, it's likely that many 7s have been revealed. There are 40 digits remaining, and with 5 players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 8 per player, totaling 40. Given the history, challenging seems like a reasonable move, as the bid might be too high to sustain.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, and I've seen from previous rounds that 7s are common (last round had 6 total). Since I'm starting the bidding and know I have two 7s, a conservative opening bid of 4 7s should be safe. This matches the initial bid from the previous successful round.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (54439278). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll base my decision on my hand and the current bid. I can bid 5 7s or 4 8s. Given that I have one 7 and no 8s, bidding 4 8s might be too risky unless I think others are likely to have 8s. Bidding 5 7s seems more reasonable as it increases the quantity, and I know at least one 7 exists in my hand. Thus, I'll choose to bid 5 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, but previous challenges showed higher counts of 7s (6 and 7). Bidding 6 7s is a logical increase from 5 7s, leveraging the historical pattern of 7s being more prevalent. Challenging risks elimination if the count is indeed 6 (as previously seen), so bidding is safer.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:0 - o3-2025-04-16) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I see only 2 sevens in my own 8-digit hand. To make Player 5’s bid of 6 7s true, the other three players (24 unknown digits) must contain at least 4 more sevens. In the previous rounds the table revealed 7 sevens out of 48 digits and 6 out of 40 digits, about 15 % sevens overall. At that rate we would expect roughly 3–4 sevens among the 24 unseen digits, so the probability there are at least 4 is around or below 50 %. Rather than raise to an even riskier bid, it is wiser to test this one.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains two 5s. Since the current bid is 'None' and I need to start the round, bidding 5 5s is a reasonable opening. This accounts for my two 5s and assumes there are at least three more in the other players' hands, which is plausible given the total digits remaining (24). The bid is conservative but allows for escalation if opponents believe they can challenge it.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand (74771559). The current bid is 5 5s, and with 24 total digits in play across 3 players, this is quite possible. Given my two 5s, and that Player 5 confidently bid 5 5s, it's likely they have at least 2-3 fives. Making a higher bid would be risky since I'd need to claim either 6 5s (which seems unlikely given I only know of my two) or bid a higher digit with 5 quantity (like 5 6s or higher). Since the current bid of 5 5s seems reasonable based on my hand and the remaining digits, I should bid 5 6s to stay safe while increasing the bid.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 (from 54439278) in my hand, so the total count of 6s across all players is at least 1 (mine) + unknown others. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have information about the other players' hands, I'll consider my own hand and the total digits. Bidding 6 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, bidding 5 7s is also valid as it increases the digit. Given that there's a history of players bidding relatively high quantities and winning, and considering the total digits remaining (24), bidding 6 6s is a cautious increase.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:1 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s by Player 4. My hand contains one 6, so the remaining two players would need to have at least five 6s combined in their 16 digits. Given that 6s are 10% of all digits, the expected count is 1.6 in 16 digits. A count of five 6s is statistically improbable (binomial probability ~1.9%). Previous challenges have succeeded, suggesting bids may be inflated. Challenging this unlikely bid offers a high-reward opportunity to eliminate Player 4 if the bid is false.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: As the starting player, I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 5s and two 2s. Bidding 3 5s is a safe choice since I already have two, and it's likely the opponent has at least one 5. This bid is conservative but provides room to raise if challenged, leveraging the higher digit value for future flexibility.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand (74771559). With only two players remaining and 16 total digits, the opponent's bid of 3 5s is quite reasonable since I already have 2 of them. Based on the game history, Player 5 has shown to be a reliable bidder. I should continue bidding rather than challenge. Since I can't be certain of more 5s, I'll bid 3 6s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit. This is safer than increasing the quantity.

Player 2 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 5s. The opponent bid 4 5s total, which means they're claiming there are at least 2 more 5s in their hand. Given the previous rounds, especially where Player 5 started with a 5s bid, it's plausible they have multiple 5s. With 2 in my hand and likely at least 2 in theirs, 4 5s is a reasonable bid. I should either bid higher or challenge. Since 4 5s seems legitimate based on my hand, making a higher bid of 4 6s is safer than challenging.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand contains one 6 and two 5s. Bidding 5 5s increases the quantity while using a digit I have, making it a plausible challenge for Player 2 to meet. Challenging 4 6s risks losing if Player 2 has at least three 6s, which is possible. Bidding 5 5s leverages my existing 5s and raises the stakes without overcommitting.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand (74771559). The current bid is '5 5s', meaning Player 5 claims there are at least 5 fives total between our hands. Since I only have 2 fives, Player 5 would need to have at least 3 fives in their hand for this bid to be valid. While possible, this seems unlikely given the bidding pattern and their previous bids. They've been aggressively bidding on 5s, which could be a bluff. With 8 digits in their hand, having 3+ fives would be quite concentrated. I should challenge.
