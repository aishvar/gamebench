Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 and one 0 in my hand, which suggests these digits might be reasonably common among all players. Since there are 48 digits total, starting with a moderate bid like 3 7s is a safe opening bid to establish a baseline without being too risky.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which means there needs to be at least two more 7s among the other five players (total of 40 digits). Given the low probability of having two more 7s in the remaining digits, it's unlikely the bid is valid. Therefore, I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, which supports bidding a quantity of 3 or more 7s as a reasonable starting bid. Since there is no current bid, I can set the initial bid. Bidding 3 7s is a safe and plausible opening bid given my hand, encouraging the game to progress.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand and the total number of digits is 32. Starting with a bid of 3 7s is reasonable since it's likely there are at least three 7s across all players. This is a safe opening bid to set the pace.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 7 and two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s, which has been successful in previous rounds. Bidding 3 8s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, leveraging my two 8s and likely distribution of digits among other players. Challenging risks elimination given the bid's prior success.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Player 3 bid 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that there are only 32 digits remaining across 4 players (8 digits each), it's unlikely that there are 3 8s in total. Challenging seems like a good move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand. The total digits remaining are 24, and with two other players, there's a high likelihood that at least one more 5 exists in their hands. Bidding 4 5s is a reasonable starting bid, leveraging my three 5s and assuming at least one additional 5 in the remaining digits. This bid is both higher in quantity than a basic 3 5s and maintains a plausible chance of being true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have zero 5s in my hand. Player 3 bid 4 5s. Given the previous rounds where bids were challenged and won, and the fact that I have no 5s, it's highly likely that there are fewer than 4 5s in total. Challenging seems like the best option to try and eliminate Player 3.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 3 Reasoning: As the starting player, I need to make the first valid bid. My hand contains three 5s. Bidding 4 5s is reasonable because I have three, and there's a good chance the opponent has at least one 5. This bid is conservative yet leverages my existing digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have only one 5 in my hand, so I need to consider if bidding higher is reasonable. I have two 7s, which is a better digit to bid on. The next higher bid after 4 5s must have either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Bidding 4 7s is valid and plausible given I have two 7s and the total digits are 16. Challenging now might be risky because 4 5s was previously supported by actual counts. Therefore, I will bid 4 7s.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:1 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand contains one 7 and two 8s. Bidding 4 8s leverages my two 8s and raises the digit while maintaining the same quantity. This forces Player 0 to either accept a higher-digit claim or challenge, which could backfire if they lack sufficient 8s. Since I have two 8s, it's more plausible that combined with Player 0's hand, the total 8s meet or exceed four compared to the 7s scenario where I only have one. This bid balances risk and hand knowledge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Since the bid is at quantity 4, digit 8, I need to bid higher. The next higher bid could be 4 9s or 5 0s. I have no 9s, but I do have one 7 and one 5, which are lower digits. I can increase the quantity to 5 and bid 5 0s, which is a valid higher bid. Bidding 5 0s is a reasonable step up and not too aggressive, given I have one 0 in my hand. Challenging now seems risky because 4 8s is plausible. Therefore, I will bid 5 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 5s in my hand. The current bid is 5 0s. Bidding 5 5s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, making it a valid higher bid. This is plausible since I have three 5s, and Player 0 might have at least two more to meet the total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have one 5 in my hand and one 0, but the bid is already at quantity 5. To make a valid higher bid, I need either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since the quantity is 5, I can bid 5 6s or higher digit at the same quantity, or increase the quantity to 6 with any digit. I have one 7 in my hand, so bidding 5 7s is a reasonable next step, as it is higher than 5 5s and I hold one 7, making it plausible. Bidding 6 of any digit might be risky given the current bid and my hand. Therefore, I will bid 5 7s.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:1 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have one 7 in my hand, so Player 0 must have four 7s for the bid to be true. Given the low probability of Player 0 having four 7s in their 8-digit hand (especially with no prior evidence of high 7 concentration), challenging the bid is the optimal move. Previous challenges in the game history have often resulted in the bidder winning, but this bid exceeds reasonable statistical likelihood. A challenge would test the validity of the claim directly.
