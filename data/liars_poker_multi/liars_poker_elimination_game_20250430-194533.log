Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. Starting the bidding with 3 4s seems reasonable since it's based on my own digits and the total possible across all players. This sets a moderate baseline that others will need to raise, leveraging the uncertainty about the remaining hands.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have four 3s in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s. Bidding 4 3s is a valid higher bid (increased quantity) based on my strong holdings of 3s, even though the digit is lower. This leverages my known 3s to push the bid forward.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Challenging 4 3s would likely lose since I expect about four 3s among the 40 unknown cards plus my one. Instead, I can minimally increase the bid by keeping the quantity at 4 and raising the digit to 9. With roughly 4 expected 9s among unknown cards plus my two, bidding 4 9s is plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. It's plausible that there are at least four 9s in total. I could bid higher, but I'm not confident enough to increase the quantity significantly. I will make a slightly higher bid of 5 0s, increasing the quantity while choosing a digit that I don't have in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have the hand 41567666, which contains no 0s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits in total. A bid of 5 0s implies that there are at least 5 zeros among the 48 digits. Given that I have no zeros and there are 5 other players, it's possible that they collectively have 5 or more zeros. However, considering the distribution, bidding 5 1s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit. I can see that there's at least one 1 and multiple 6s in my hand, suggesting that others might also have these digits, making a bid on a higher digit plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. The current bid is 5 1s, which means there would need to be at least three more 1s among the other five players (total of 40 digits). Given that the bid has already increased from 5 0s to 5 1s, it's possible but risky. I could bid 5 2s, but I only have one 2 in my hand. Alternatively, I could challenge, but with two 1s in my hand, it's plausible that there are at least three more among the other players. Bidding 5 2s seems like a safer move to keep the game going.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 5 2s. Since 5 4s is a higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and I have a moderate basis to suspect there may be more 4s in other hands, this bid is strategically valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 5 4s. Bidding 5 5s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity. Given the expected distribution of digits (48 total), the average count for any digit is ~4.8. Since I have one 5, others likely hold enough 5s to meet the bid. Challenging the current bid is risky as 5 4s is close to the expected average. A bid of 5 5s balances plausibility and strategic progression.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand and no one else has bid 9s yet. Moving to 5 9s is a valid raise (same quantity, higher digit) and with two guaranteed, the chance of at least five 9s among all 48 digits is about 78%, making this a strong, plausible bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. I could bid 6 0s, but that feels risky. I could also challenge, but 5 9s doesn't seem entirely unreasonable with 48 total digits. I will bid slightly higher to see if I can get someone else to challenge or fold. I will bid 6 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. My hand is 41567666, which contains no 0s. Given that there are 48 total digits and 6 players, the maximum number of 0s I can expect is if every other player had as many 0s as possible. However, it's unlikely that all other players have a high number of 0s. I have to make a bid that is higher than 6 0s. I can either bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since my hand doesn't contain any 0s, and there are 5 other players, bidding 6 1s seems reasonable as it increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. The current bid is 6 1s. With 5 other players, it's possible that the total count of 1s is at least 6, but it's a risky bid. Since I can't bid higher in quantity without going to 7, which seems too high, and I can't bid the same quantity with a higher digit (since 1 is the lowest digit), the best option is to challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. Since the current bid is None and I'm starting the round, I should make a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 3 0s is reasonable as it's slightly higher than what I have, considering other players might have 0s as well.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s. Bidding 3 4s (same quantity but higher digit) is a valid higher bid and leverages my strong position with 4s, which are more likely to meet or exceed the bid compared to lower digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have four 3s in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s. Bidding 4 3s is a valid higher bid (increasing quantity from 3 to 4) and is supported by my hand. This ensures the bid is likely true, as I already have four 3s, making it a safe move.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 9s, and the current bid is 4 3s. To meet 4 9s I need only two more across the 32 unknown digits, which has about an 84% chance. Bidding 4 9s is valid (same quantity, higher digit) and gives me a strong position.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. To bid, I need to bid higher. I could bid 5 of any digit or 4 of a digit higher than 9 (which doesn't exist, so it would have to be 0). Bidding 5 0s seems like a safe option, as I don't have any 0s and it's a small increase. However, given the limited number of digits (40), and the fact that 4 9s has already been bid, it might be risky. I'll bid 5 0s. I could also challenge, but I don't have a strong reason to believe the bid is incorrect.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. The current bid is 5 0s, which seems high given that there are only 40 digits in total and 0s are not particularly common. The previous round saw a challenge on a similar bid (6 1s) which was successful. Given that, I think challenging the current bid is the best move.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 2 0s. Bidding 2 4s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and aligns with my strong 4s. This bid is likely safe since I already hold two 4s, requiring at least one more from other players, which is plausible.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains four 3s, which supports a bid on 3s. The current bid is 2 4s, which is low given 32 total digits. Bidding 3 3s increases the quantity and uses my strong digit (3s) to create a defensible bid. Challenging 2 4s is risky since even without my 4s, others could collectively hold 2 4s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 9s in my hand (8,5,4,9,9,0,3,2). The current bid is 3 3s. By bidding 3 9s (same quantity, higher digit), I leverage my strong position—needing only one more 9 from the other 24 cards. The probability of at least one 9 among them is over 90%, making this a safe increase.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand (20388130). The current bid is 3 9s, which means there would need to be at least two more 9s among the other three players' hands (total of 24 digits). Given that 9s are less common digits and the previous bids have been aggressive, challenging seems reasonable as the likelihood of two more 9s is low.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand and there are 16 unknown digits. The expected number of 9s among them is about 1.6, making a total of at least three 9s quite likely. Opening with 3 9s is a safe bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Given the expected average of 2.4 for any digit in 24 total digits and the need for at least two additional 9s in the remaining 16 digits (Players 1 and 2), the probability of meeting or exceeding 3 total 9s is estimated around 45% (Poisson distribution). This makes challenging a calculated risk, especially since Player 2's bid appears aggressive. Previous successful challenges against similar bids (e.g., Player 5's challenge of Player 3's 5 0s) suggest that overbids are vulnerable. Challenging avoids committing to a high-risk 4+ bid with uncertain support.
