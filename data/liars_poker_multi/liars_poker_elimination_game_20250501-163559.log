Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have my 8 digits: 52571816. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 2, one 5, one 6, one 7, one 8. Since I'm the first bidder, I should start conservatively but strategically. Starting with what I know I have, bidding '3 1s' is reasonable - I have one 1, and with 5 other players having 8 digits each, it's very likely there are at least two more 1s among them.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have two 1s in my hand (12547351). This means only one more 1 is needed across the other 40 digits (5 players * 8 digits) for the bid to be true. The expected number of 1s across all 48 digits is 4.8 (48/10). Given my two 1s, the expected total is even higher. Therefore, challenging 3 1s is extremely risky and likely to fail. I need to make a higher bid. My hand also contains two 5s. Bidding '3 5s' is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). With two 5s in my hand, the expected total number of 5s is 2 (mine) + 40/10 (others) = 6. A bid of 3 5s is very safe and uses information from my hand without significantly increasing the quantity early in the round.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 5 0s is a reasonable increase in quantity. Alternatively, I could bid on another digit I have, but increasing the quantity of 0s seems like the safest option given the current bid and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. The current bid is 5 0s. Considering the expected number of 0s across all players (48 digits total, 10% chance per digit), the expected count is 4.8. The bid of 5 0s is near this expectation, making it plausible. Challenging risks losing if the bid is correct. Bidding 6 0s increases the quantity while maintaining the digit, leveraging my two 0s and the likelihood of additional 0s in others' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze whether I should challenge the current bid of '6 0s' or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (81228340), I have one '0'. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For the bid of '6 0s' to be valid, there need to be at least 6 zeros across all players. I already have 1 zero, so there would need to be at least 5 more zeros among the other 5 players, which is certainly possible (averaging 1 zero per other player). Since the bid seems reasonable, I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two '2's and two '8's, which might give me an advantage in bidding those digits. I'll bid '6 2s' to maintain the same quantity but increase the digit value, which constitutes a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (52571816), I only see one 2. For the bid of '6 2s' to be true, there would need to be 5 more 2s among the other players' hands. While this is possible, the fact that Player 5 jumped to this bid after a series of 0s bids seems suspicious. Given that I can see one 2 and would need 5 more among 40 remaining digits (48 - 8 in my hand), the probability feels low enough to warrant a challenge. The odds of having exactly 5 more 2s in 40 random digits is not favorable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 1, one 2, one 5, one 6, one 7, and two 8s. Since I'm starting the round and there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total), a conservative opening bid would be reasonable. Given I have two 8s myself, and 8 is a relatively high digit that gives room for others to bid up, starting with '3 8s' seems strategic - it's likely there are at least one more 8 among the other 32 digits in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 0. There are 5 players and 40 total digits. The expected number of any digit is 4. A bid of 3 is quite low and likely true, making a challenge risky. I have zero 8s, meaning the other 4 players (32 digits) need to have at least three 8s. The probability of this is reasonably high (estimated >60%), so challenging is not advisable. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 12547351, containing two 1s and two 5s. Bidding based on my hand is generally a good strategy. Possible bids higher than 3 8s include 3 9s, 4 0s, 4 1s, 4 2s, etc. Bidding 4 1s or 4 5s leverages my hand. Since I have two 5s, bidding '4 5s' requires only two more 5s among the remaining 32 digits held by other players. This is statistically plausible (expected number of 5s among 32 digits is 3.2). It's a safe increase from the current low bid and utilizes the information from my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. My hand contains a 6, and bidding 4 6s is a valid higher bid since it maintains the same quantity but increases the digit. This leverages my existing digits without overcommitting.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 6s would be risky without knowing the other players' hands. A challenge seems reasonable, as 4 6s represents a significant portion of the remaining 40 digits, and it's unlikely to be true if I have none. Challenging is better than blindly bidding and potentially being eliminated.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: It's the start of a new round with 32 total digits remaining and 4 players. The previous rounds saw aggressive bidding and successful challenges. I have one 3, one 5, one 7, two 0s, one 8, and two 9s in my hand. Given the small number of total digits, and that the last two rounds ended with successful challenges, I should make a conservative bid. I have two 0s, so bidding 3 0s is reasonable. It's a small increase over the previous bids and doesn't commit me too strongly.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s, which is likely true given the expected distribution of digits. Bidding 4 0s increases the quantity while maintaining the digit, leveraging the higher-than-expected probability of additional 0s in the remaining 24 digits (expected ~2.4 0s). Challenging is risky as the bid is plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (52571816), I have zero 0s. Player 4 claims there are at least 4 zeros among all players. With 32 total digits and 4 players, each having 8 digits, and knowing I have no zeros, that means the other 3 players would need to have at least 4 zeros between them. While possible, this seems unlikely given that I've seen Player 4's bidding behavior in previous rounds being aggressive (like bidding 6 0s in the first round). Additionally, Player 3's lower bid of 3 0s suggests they might not have many zeros either. Based on this pattern and my hand knowledge, I think Player 4 is bluffing.

Since I'm starting the round with 3 players (24 total digits), a conservative opening bid would be reasonable.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 0. I have two 5s in my hand (12547351). This means the bid requires only one more 5 among the other 16 digits held by Player 0 and Player 3. This is statistically likely (approx 81.5% chance), so challenging is risky. I need to make a higher bid. A higher bid could be 3 6s, 3 7s, etc., or 4 0s, 4 1s, etc. I have two 1s in my hand. Bidding 4 1s requires two more 1s from the remaining 16 digits, which is plausible. This increases the quantity and is supported by my hand.

Bidding 4 3s is a reasonable option, slightly increasing the quantity. Bidding 5 0s is also possible but feels riskier given the previous rounds' challenges involving 0s. Therefore, I will bid 4 3s.

Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 52571816, I have zero 3s. The current bid claims there are 4 3s total among all players. With only 24 total digits remaining (8 per player), and knowing I have none in my hand, this means the other two players would need to have at least 4 3s between them. While possible, this seems unlikely given the conservative bidding pattern shown in the game history. Previous challenges have succeeded at similar bid levels (4 0s, 4 6s). Based on this and having zero 3s in my hand, challenging is the safer option than making a higher bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s made by Player 0. My hand is 12547351. I have two 1s in my hand. This means the bid of 2 1s is guaranteed to be accurate, as the total count of 1s across both hands is at least two (my two). Therefore, I cannot challenge this bid, as I would lose. I must make a higher bid. Possible higher bids are 2 2s, 2 3s, ..., or 3 0s, 3 1s, ... I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 2 5s is a valid higher bid (same quantity '2', higher digit '5' > '1') and is guaranteed to be true based on my hand alone. This is a safe and strategically sound move.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. With only 16 total digits in play (8 per player), and the opponent bidding 2 5s, this is a reasonable bid since I already account for one of them.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s made by Player 0. I have 8 digits: 12547351. I have zero 6s. For the current bid to be true, Player 0 must have at least two 6s in their 8 digits. While possible, challenging is risky as I would lose if Player 0 has two or more 6s. I need to make a higher bid. Options include bidding 2 7s (or higher digits) or bidding 3 of any digit. I have two 1s in my hand. Player 0 started this round by bidding 2 1s, which strongly suggests they possess at least one 1. Therefore, it is highly likely that the total count of 1s across both hands (16 digits total) is at least three (my two + Player 0's one or more). Bidding 3 1s is a valid higher bid than 2 6s and is very likely to be true based on my hand and Player 0's previous bidding.
