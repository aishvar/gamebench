Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there is no current bid, I need to start the bidding. My hand is 41431430, which has three 4s, two 1s, and single digits for 0 and 3. Bidding on 4s seems reasonable as I already have three of them, and with 48 total digits across all players, it's plausible that there are at least a couple more 4s out there. I'll bid 5 4s to set a moderate challenge while leaving room for escalation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 5 4s, which means there would need to be at least four more 4s among the other five players (who have 40 digits total). This seems possible but not guaranteed, so I'll make a conservative higher bid by increasing the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 5s in my hand, which means there need to be at least 5 fives in the other 40 digits (since I have 8 digits). While this is possible, it's about a 12.5% probability per digit to be a 5, meaning we'd expect around 5 fives total across all hands. Given I see zero 5s in my hand, the claim of 5 fives seems unlikely. Additionally, Player 1 only increased the digit from Player 0's bid, not the quantity, suggesting they might be bluffing. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and have a good view of my hand. I see one 4, one 3, one 6, one 9, one 0, one 1, and no 5s. Since I won the last challenge on 5 5s (actual count was 3), I know there aren't many 5s in play. A conservative opening bid would be best. Given I have one 4 in my hand, bidding 3 4s is a reasonable starting point - it's likely there are at least two more 4s among the other 32 digits in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s, which I cannot support since I have no 4s. Bidding 3 5s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity. Since I hold one 5 and there are four other players, it’s plausible that at least two more 5s exist across their hands. This bid is strategically defensible without relying on my own digits alone.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Player 3 bid 3 5s. I have zero 5s in my hand. Bidding higher than 3 5s is necessary. I have two 2s, three 3s, one 6, one 8. I can bid 4 2s, 4 3s, 4 6s, or 4 8s. Alternatively, I could bid 3 6s or 3 8s. Given the previous challenge and elimination, players might be bluffing more. I have three 3s, so bidding 4 3s is a reasonable option, increasing the quantity. It's also a digit that hasn't been heavily bid on yet.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have 0 threes in my hand; the chance of at least four 3s among the other 32 cards is only about 40%, so the bid of “4 3s” is unlikely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I need to make the first bid. I have two 3s in my hand. A conservative bid would be 1 3s. However, Player 3 just bid 3 5s and Player 4 (me) previously bid 4 3s, so a slightly higher bid might be more believable and less likely to be challenged immediately. I'll bid 2 3s, which is a valid opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:2 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 41431430, which contains three 4s and two 3s. The current bid is 2 3s by Player 4, which is very low and likely true since I already have two 3s myself. With 32 total digits across 4 players, I can safely make a higher bid. Bidding 3 4s seems reasonable since I have three 4s in my hand, and it's possible there are more among the other players. This bid increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a strategic move to keep the game going without taking unnecessary risk of a challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. With 32 total digits and 4 players, the average per digit is 3.2. Player 0's bid of 3 4s seems reasonable given I have one 4. Since I can't be certain it's false and the bid is relatively conservative, challenging would be risky. Looking at my hand, I see I have a 6, so I can safely bid '3 6s' - keeping the same quantity but using a higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, making it risky to bid on 6s. Bidding on a higher digit like 8s (which I have two of) increases credibility. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid than 3 6s, leveraging my existing 8s and assuming others may hold additional 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand. Bidding higher seems risky. I could bid 4 8s, but that's very unlikely to be true given my hand. I could bid on a digit I have, like 3s (I have three 3s), but that would require bidding 4 3s which is lower than the previous bid of 3 4s. The best course of action is to challenge the current bid of 3 8s. It's highly improbable that there are three 8s among the remaining 32 digits, especially since I have none.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: As the first to bid, I need to set a reasonable starting point. My hand contains three 9s, which is a high digit. Bidding 3 9s is a safe starting bid because I have exactly three, so if challenged, the actual count would be at least three (my own), ensuring I win the challenge. This bid is conservative and leverages my known holdings without overextending.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:2 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 41431430, which contains no 9s. The current bid by Player 3 is 3 9s. With only 24 total digits across three players, and considering I have none, the likelihood of there being at least 3 9s in the remaining 16 digits seems plausible but not overly high. However, since the bid is relatively low (only 3), it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I have four 4s in my hand, which is a strong count for a single digit. Bidding 4 4s increases the quantity and changes the digit, making it a reasonable escalation based on my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Looking at my hand, I have only one 4. For the current bid of '4 4s' to be true, there would need to be three more 4s between the other two players (since I only have one). While possible, this seems unlikely given the relatively high quantity. Additionally, in previous rounds, Player 0 has shown a tendency to make aggressive bids. With only 24 total digits in play and my single 4, challenging seems like the safer option than raising to 5 4s or switching to a different digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet in this round and I am starting the bidding with Player 3 as the only other active player, I need to make an initial bid. My hand is 41431430, which contains four 4s, one 1, one 3, and one 0. With a total of 16 digits across both players, I can make a conservative bid based on my strong count of 4s. Bidding 5 4s is reasonable, as it accounts for my four 4s and assumes Player 3 might have at least one 4, which is plausible. This bid sets a moderate starting point and reduces the risk of an immediate challenge.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:3 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s by Player 0. My hand contains no 4s, so the total 4s must come entirely from Player 0's hand. Given that each player has 8 digits, it is statistically unlikely Player 0 has 5 or more 4s. Challenging this bid offers a high probability of winning if the count is less than 5, which is plausible given random distribution.
