Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player (Player 0), I must make a bid. My hand is 31458152. I have two 1s and two 5s, which are the most frequent digits. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total), the expected count for any specific digit is 4.8. Based on my two 5s, the statistically expected total number of 5s is around 6 (2 in my hand + 4 expected in the other 40 digits). Bidding '4 5s' is a reasonable opening bid; it's supported by my hand, slightly below the statistical expectation, and uses one of my most frequent digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 3s in my hand and I know there are 48 digits remaining across all players. Player 0 bid 4 5s. It's reasonable to believe there are at least 5 3s in total. I will bid 5 3s, increasing the quantity while using a digit I have in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s. My hand contains two 5s, and I have no 3s. Bidding 5 5s increases the digit value while maintaining the same quantity. Since there are 5 other players, it is plausible that at least three additional 5s exist in their hands. This bid is strategically higher than the current bid and leverages my existing 5s to strengthen the claim.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 5 5s. Raising to 5 7s is a valid increase (same quantity, higher digit) and requires only three more 7s among the other 40 unknown digits, which is very likely (~78%). This is a safe raise that pressures the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s, and I need to make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (4, 5, 4, 0, 0, 2, 5, 8), I have two 5s and one 8, but no 7s. To beat 5 7s, I could bid 6 0s, 6 2s, 6 4s, or 6 8s. Given I have two 5s and one 8, I might consider bidding 6 8s, but I only have one 8, so that's unlikely. Alternatively, I can bid 6 0s or 6 2s, which I have enough of (two 0s and one 2). Since I have two 0s, I can confidently bid 6 0s, which is higher than 5 7s, and it's a plausible bid. Bidding 6 0s seems reasonable and safe.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand. The expected total count of 0s across all 48 digits is around 4.8, making 6 seem unlikely. Since the bid requires at least 6 zeros and the statistical probability favors fewer than 6, challenging is the optimal move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one 3 in my hand (31458152). This means only two more 3s are needed among the remaining 32 digits held by the other 4 players for the bid to be true. With 40 total digits, the expected average count for any digit is 4. A bid of 3 is below average and thus quite likely to be true. Challenging is too risky. I need to make a higher bid. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). It's a safe bid, as it only requires one more 5 among the other 32 digits, which is highly probable given my hand and the total number of digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. With 40 digits remaining and 5 players, the average digit count per player is 8. I have two 3s in my hand, and the previous bid of 5 3s suggests there could be several 3s in other players' hands. Bidding 4 3s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 4 3s. Bidding 4 5s increases the digit while keeping the same quantity, which is a reasonable move based on my hand. This bid is plausible given the total digits and my contribution of two 5s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I hold two 7s in my hand. To make the bid 4 7s, I only need two more 7s among the 32 unknown cards, which has a high probability (~84%). Challenging 4 5s is risky since thereâ€™s still a good chance of four 5s existing. Bidding 4 7s is a strong, valid raise.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid of 4 7s seems plausible given the expected distribution of digits. Bidding 4 8s follows the required hierarchy (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages my knowledge of holding at least one 8. Challenging would risk elimination if the 7s count meets or exceeds 4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (31458152). The expected number of 8s across all 40 digits is 4. Therefore, the bid of 4 8s is statistically average and not inherently unlikely, making a challenge risky. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 4 9s or increasing the quantity to 5. I have two 1s and two 5s. Bidding 5 1s or 5 5s is statistically supported by my hand, as the expected number of any digit among the remaining 32 digits (held by others) is 3.2. A bid of 5 requires 3 more digits from others, which is below the expectation. I previously bid 3 5s, and Player 2 bid 4 5s. Bidding 5 5s leverages my strong hand (two 5s) and aligns with the bidding history for this digit, potentially putting pressure on the next players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have three 3s in my hand, which makes a bid of 6 3s unlikely. I do not have any 6s in my hand, but I do have three 3s, which makes a bid of 6 3s unlikely. I also do not have any 7s or 8s in my hand. The only digit I have more than one of is 3, and even then, I only have three of them. Given that there are only 40 digits remaining, a bid of 6 0s seems unlikely. Therefore, I should challenge the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It's my turn to start the bidding in this round with 4 active players and 32 total digits. The expected average count for any digit is 3.2. My hand is 31458152, containing two 1s and two 5s. Opening with a bid based on one of these pairs is a good strategy. Bidding '3 1s' is a safe and conservative opening bid, as I already hold two 1s, making it likely there's at least one more among the other 24 digits held by the other 3 players. This bid is low, forcing subsequent players to increase the bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 1s, which I can surpass by bidding 3 7s (same quantity, higher digit). This is a safe bid since my hand alone meets the 3 7s requirement, making it a low-risk move to increase pressure on others.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand and the current bid is only three 7s. Given 32 total digits, thereâ€™s a ~92% chance that at least one other 7 exists among the 24 unknown digits, so challenging is too risky. By bidding four 7s, I leverage my two known 7s and only need two more among 24 digits, which has a ~71% chance of being true. Therefore I raise to four 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 3s by Player 5. I have one 3 in my hand (31458152). This means the other 3 players need to have at least four 3s among their 24 digits for the bid to be true. The expected number of 3s in those 24 digits is 2.4 (24/10). Needing 4 is significantly above average, making a challenge plausible. However, 5 out of 32 total digits is not an impossible bid. Player 5 previously bid 3 3s, suggesting they might hold some. Instead of challenging, I can make a slightly higher bid based on my hand. I have two 5s. Bidding 5 5s requires only three more 5s among the other 24 digits. This is statistically more likely (needing 3 vs needing 4) than the current bid of 5 3s, given my hand. It's a minimal increase in bid (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages my strongest pair. I also won a challenge on 5 5s last round, which might add complexity to how others perceive this bid.

The expected number of 5s in those 24 digits is 2.4, making the total expected count 4.4. The probability of the actual count being â‰¥5 is ~43.56%, meaning the bid is likely false.

Player 0 Reasoning: This is the final round with only two players (myself and Player 5) and 16 total digits. I need to make the opening bid. My hand is 31458152, containing two 1s and two 5s. The expected average count for any digit is 1.6 (16 digits / 10 possibilities). Bids based on my hand are strongest. I have previously won challenges by bidding 3 1s (actual count was 3 with 24 digits) and 5 5s twice (actual count was 5 with 40 and 32 digits). Player 5 is aware of this history. Bidding '3 1s' is a strong opening: it's supported by my two 1s, requires Player 5 to have only one 1 (statistically plausible: 1 - (0.9^8) â‰ˆ 57% chance), and leverages my successful bid history with 1s. This forces Player 5 into a difficult position early on.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid of 3 1s requires at least three 1s in total across both players' hands. I have one 1 in my hand (83602173), so Player 0 must have at least two 1s for the bid to be valid. Statistical analysis suggests that Player 0 having two or more 1s is relatively unlikely (estimated ~18.7% probability). Additionally, challenging this bid avoids escalating with a bid that could be weak (e.g., 3 3s) or risky (e.g., 4+ quantity). The historical success of Player 0's 3 1s bid in a prior round adds uncertainty, but the low probability of two 1s in Player 0's hand favors challenging.
