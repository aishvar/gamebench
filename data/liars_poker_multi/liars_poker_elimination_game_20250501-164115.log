Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is the minimum possible: 1 0s. I must make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (12870492), I have one 0, two 2s, and two 9s. Since there are 48 digits in play, it's statistically reasonable to increase either the quantity or the digit. I'll bid 2 2s, as I already have two 2s in my hand, making it a safe and valid higher bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s. I have the hand 83963502, which contains two 2s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 2s, it's likely that the total count of 2s across all players is at least 2 * 6 = 12 (if everyone had as many 2s as me), but that's an overestimation. A more conservative bid would be to increase the digit. I can bid 2 3s, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. My hand is 16200370, which contains three 0s. Bidding 3 0s is a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity from 2 to 3. This bid is strongly supported by the digits in my hand, making it a safe and strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 0s' and my hand '87306056', I notice I have one '0' and multiple other digits. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 players, each with 8 digits, the bid of '3 0s' seems relatively low. However, without specific knowledge of other players' hands, it's challenging to accurately assess the likelihood of this bid being true. Since my hand contains a '0' and other digits, and given that increasing the quantity or the digit would require careful consideration, I should look for a reasonable increase. Given that '3 0s' is the current bid, a logical next step could be to either increase the quantity of '0s' or move to a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I only have one '0', increasing the quantity of '0s' might not be the best strategy without more information about other players' '0' counts. Thus, moving to a higher digit with the same quantity could be a viable strategy, considering the distribution of digits in my hand and the goal to make a higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: Challenging 3 1s is unwise: with 48 digits in play and none in my hand, the chance that at least three 1s exist is high. I hold two 5s, so by bidding 4 5s I only need two more 5s among the 40 unknown digits—an event with roughly a 92% likelihood. This safely beats the current bid by increasing quantity and leverages information from my own hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: I start the bidding this round. I have two 5s in my hand. Last round we learned there were exactly four 5s among all 48 digits. Player 0 has been eliminated, and the chance he held both of the other two 5s is very small (~4%). So it is very likely (over 96%) that there are at least three 5s still among the 40 digits now in play. Opening with 3 5s is therefore very safe while still giving me room to maneuver in later turns.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have the digits 1, 2, 8, 7, 0, 4, 9, 2 in my hand. I have no 5s, making it unlikely that there are a large number of 5s overall, but the current bid is only 3 5s, which is plausible with 40 digits in play. Challenging now is risky since even distribution would expect each digit to appear about 4 times. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the digit or quantity. I have two 2s in my hand, so bidding 3 6s or 3 7s would be risky since I have none, but bidding 3 8s is reasonable since I have one 8 and 40 digits in play. This is a safe incremental bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 1. I have one 8 in my hand (83963502), so the total count of 8s is at least 1. I need to either make a higher bid or challenge. Since I have some information about my own hand and the total count of 8s must be at least 1, I can try to make a reasonable bid. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid as it increases the digit. I choose to bid 3 9s because it's a conservative increase and I have no 9s in my hand, making it a relatively safe bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. My hand contains three 0s and zero 9s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected count for any digit is 4. The current bid of 3 9s is slightly below the expected value for the other 4 players (3.2 expected 9s). Challenging this bid is risky, as Player 2 might actually have two or three 9s. My hand is strong in 0s (three of them). Bidding 4 0s is a valid higher bid (increase in quantity) and leverages my hand strength. I need only one additional 0 from the remaining 32 digits, which is very likely given the expected count of 3.2 zeros among other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 0s and considering my hand has one 0, I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Since my hand contains two 6s, which is a higher digit than 0, and considering the total number of digits remaining is 40, bidding on a higher digit seems plausible. However, the quantity of 4 for the digit 0 is relatively low, and given that I have one 0, it's possible that the total count of 0s could indeed be at least 4 across all players. Making a bid on a higher digit than 0, such as the 6s I have in my hand, could be a good strategy, especially since the current bid is on 0s and moving to a higher digit could put pressure on other players who might not have as many of the higher digits.

Player 5 Reasoning: Challenging 4 6s is risky: I already have 1 six and, with 32 unseen digits, the expected total of sixes is about 4, so the bid is quite plausible. I can’t raise with 5 5s because the previous round revealed there were only 4 fives in the whole 48-digit pool, and one player’s digits have now been removed, so 5 fives is impossible. The safest legal raise is to keep the quantity at 4 but move the digit up. I hold one 7; needing only three more 7s among the remaining 32 digits gives roughly a 63% chance the bid is correct, which is better than challenging. Therefore I’ll bid 4 7s.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand (12870492) contains one 7. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in play. The current bid is 4 7s. Statistically, each digit should appear about 4 times (40/10). Since I only have one 7, and the bid is already at 4, it's possible but not certain that there are 4 or more 7s among all hands. However, since the bid is not outrageously high and challenging here is risky, I will make a higher bid. I have two 2s in my hand, so I will bid 4 8s, as I previously bid 3 8s and 8s may be underbid. This increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s by Player 1. I have the hand 83963502, which contains one 8. Given that there are 40 digits in total and I have one 8, it's possible that the total count of 8s is at least 4, especially considering the previous bids have been escalating. However, bidding higher seems prudent. I can either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity and bid on a higher digit. Since my hand doesn't have many high digits, I'll consider increasing the digit. Bidding 4 9s is a reasonable next step as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. My hand is 16200370, which contains three 0s and zero 9s. To make a valid bid, I must bid higher than 4 9s, which means bidding at least 5 of any digit. My strongest digit is 0, with three in my hand. To bid 5 0s, the other 4 players (with 32 total digits) would need to have at least two more 0s. The average number of 0s among 32 digits is 3.2, so requiring 2 is well within the realm of possibility. Bidding 5 0s is a plausible bid based on my hand and the remaining digits, and it's less risky than challenging a bid (4 9s) that is only slightly above the average expectation (3.2) for the remaining 32 digits, especially when I have a strong alternative bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 0s and my hand containing 87306056, I notice that increasing the quantity further might be risky due to the total digits remaining. However, I also see that bidding on a higher digit could be a safer strategy. Since my hand has two 6s and considering the bidding history, I could either challenge the current bid if I think it's unlikely or make a bid with a higher digit. Given that 0s are quite common and there are 40 digits in total, bidding on a higher digit seems like a reasonable strategy. I will choose to bid on a digit that is higher than 0 and consider the quantity based on my hand and the remaining digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I see only one 6 in my own eight digits. For Player 4’s bid of 5 6s to be true, at least four more 6s would have to be hiding in the 32 unknown digits. With digits assumed roughly uniform, the chance of finding ≥4 sixes in 32 draws is about 40 %. That means the bid is more likely false than true, so challenging gives better than even odds of eliminating Player 4 while avoiding the risk of having to make an even shakier higher bid myself.

Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current state of the game with no bids yet in this round and considering my hand contains two 6s, I should start with a bid that seems reasonable and safe. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and we have 32 total digits remaining, I should consider the distribution of digits in my hand and the history of bids. My hand has two 6s, which suggests that bidding on 6s could be a good strategy. However, starting with a higher quantity might put me at risk if others challenge. Thus, starting with a lower quantity for a higher digit seems like a safer approach, considering the game's progression and the fact that I have two 6s, which could support a bid for 6s.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains three 0s (16200370). The current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 4 0s is a valid higher bid as the quantity (4) is greater than the current bid's quantity (3). With 32 total digits across 4 players, the expected number of 0s is 3.2. Since I hold three 0s, I only need one more 0 from the remaining 24 digits held by other players. The expected number of 0s in 24 digits is 2.4, making it highly probable that at least one more 0 exists among the other players. This makes a bid of 4 0s very likely to be true and a strong move. Challenging 3 7s is riskier, as the total expected count of 7s (3.2) is close to or exceeds the bid quantity, suggesting the bid is plausible.

Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 0s' and my hand containing 87306056, I notice I have one 0. Considering the total digits remaining is 32 and there are 4 active players, each having 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 32. Since the bid '4 0s' is quite low and I have one 0, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same or increasing the digit with the same quantity could be reasonable. However, given the information and aiming to make a strategic move, I should consider what is likely to be true given the previous bids and challenges. The last challenge resulted in the bidder winning with an actual count matching their bid, indicating players are making somewhat informed bids. With my hand and the aim to make a higher bid, considering the distribution of digits and previous bids, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains two 6s and the current bid is '4 0s', making a bid that increases either the quantity or the digit is necessary. Given the presence of two 6s in my hand and the fact that '4 0s' is the current bid, bidding '5 0s' or increasing the digit with the same quantity could be strategic. However, since I don't have enough information to safely assume the presence of more 0s and given the history where bids around the middle to higher digits have been made, I should aim for a digit that is plausible and not overly ambitious. Given these considerations and my aim to not overbid, I decide to increase the digit, keeping in mind the distribution and previous bids.

Challenging at this stage with 4 players remaining is risky, as a loss results in elimination. My hand (16200370) contains two 0s. Bidding 5 0s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and is plausible based on my hand, requiring 3 additional 0s among the other 24 digits (expected value 2.4).

Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 5 0s and considering my hand 87306056, I have one 0, but bidding higher than 5 0s requires careful consideration. Since the total digits remaining are 32 and we are bidding on the total count across all players, increasing the quantity further might be risky. However, given that I have two 6s and the game history shows a previous bid of 5 6s was successful, it seems there might be a significant number of 6s. But to bid higher than 5 0s, I should consider either increasing the quantity or the digit. Given the distribution and my knowledge, bidding on a higher digit seems more plausible than increasing the quantity to 6, considering the risk of overestimation. Thus, the next logical step, considering the pattern and the need to exceed the current bid, is to bid on a digit that is higher than 0 and has a reasonable presence based on the game's history and my hand.

The bid of 5 1s is slightly above expectation but not outrageous, especially since I have one. However, since I don't have enough information about the other players' hands and the bid is not extremely improbable, it's safer to continue bidding. Looking at my hand, I have two '2's and two '0's, making those digits safer for me. The next valid bid would be 5 2s (same quantity, higher digit), which leverages my own hand strength.

Bidding 6 0s is a logical progression based on my hand strength in 0s and is a valid higher bid (higher quantity). With 3 of the required 6 in my hand, I only need 3 more 0s from the remaining 24 digits, which is a plausible count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 6 0s and my hand containing 87306056, I notice that bidding higher in quantity is risky since the total number of digits is 32, and we already have a high bid of 6. Considering the distribution of digits and the fact that I have two 6s in my hand, I should consider the likelihood of higher digits appearing more frequently. However, since the bid is on 0s and I only have one 0, I must consider the overall distribution and the bids made so far. Given that we've had several rounds and the bids have been steadily increasing, challenging the current bid seems like a viable option, especially since the bid is quite high for a single digit. I must weigh the risk of challenging versus making a potentially risky higher bid. Considering the total number of digits and the bids made, I think challenging is the safer option because the likelihood of exactly 6 zeros being present might be lower than anticipated, especially given the diversity of bids on other numbers.

Player 3 Reasoning: It is the start of a new round and I am the first bidder. My hand contains three 0s. With 24 total digits among 3 players, having 3 of a digit is above average. Bidding 4 0s is a reasonable opening bid based on my hand strength and the probability of others holding at least one 0.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 12870492, which contains one 0. With 24 digits in play and three players, the expected average per digit is about 2.4. The current bid is 4 0s, which is plausible but not excessive. Since I have only one 0, unless both other players have at least 1 or 2 each, the bid could be risky. However, it's not high enough to justify an immediate challenge. The best move is to make a higher bid. I have two 2s in my hand, so bidding 4 2s is reasonable and keeps the pressure up.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s made by Player 1. My hand is 83963502, which contains one 2. Given that there are 24 total digits and I have one 2, I can infer that there are at least 3 other 2s among the remaining 16 digits (since Player 1 and Player 3 have 8 digits each). The current bid of 4 2s seems plausible. However, I can bid higher. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 3s and one 9 in my hand, suggesting that there might be more 3s or 9s in the other players' hands. Bidding 4 3s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. My hand contains three 0s, which is my strongest digit count. Bidding 5 0s is a valid higher bid by increasing the quantity from 4 to 5. With three 0s in my hand, I only need two more 0s from the remaining 16 digits held by the other two players for the bid to be true. This is a plausible outcome and leverages my hand strength. Challenging 4 3s is also an option, but Player 2 likely has multiple 3s, making the challenge risky. Bidding 5 0s is a confident move based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. In my hand (12870492), I have one 0. With 24 digits in play and only one 0 in my hand, for there to be 5 or more 0s, the other two players would need to collectively have at least 4 more 0s. Statistically, that's possible but not highly likely, as the average number of any digit per player is 2.4. However, since previous rounds have shown that Player 3 has made aggressive 0s bids and won challenges, it's plausible they hold multiple 0s. Still, the bid is not outrageous enough to confidently challenge. I will make a higher bid by increasing the digit to 1, for which I also have one in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have one 1 in my hand (83963502). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 24 total digits and my hand has one 1, the remaining two players must have at most 4 1s between them (because 1 + 4 = 5). It's plausible they have 4 or 5 1s. Increasing the quantity to 6 is a bit aggressive but possible. Alternatively, bidding 5 2s is a safer increase in digit. I will choose to bid 5 2s as it is a more conservative move, keeping the quantity the same while increasing the digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. My hand is 16200370, containing three 0s. In the previous round, my bid of 6 0s was challenged, and the actual count was 7 0s. This means there are at least 7 0s among the three remaining players. Since I hold 3 0s, the other two players (Player 1 and Player 2) must hold at least 4 0s combined. A bid of 6 0s requires a total of 6 0s, which is guaranteed to be true given the known count of at least 7. Bidding 6 0s is a safe and strategic move, leveraging information from the previous challenge and being a valid higher bid than 5 2s (higher quantity).

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. In my hand (12870492), I have one 0. With 24 digits in play, the expected number of any digit is about 2.4. The previous challenge of 6 0s in the last round was successful, and the actual count was 7, suggesting that 0s are currently overrepresented. However, after two eliminations, the digit distribution may have shifted. Since it is still plausible there are 6 or more 0s among 24 digits, and since I only have one, I don't have enough information to confidently challenge. I will make a higher bid that is plausible given my hand, choosing 6 1s since I have one 1, and it's the next valid bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s made by Player 1. I have one 1 in my hand (83963502). To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity to 7 would be a reasonable step if I think there's a good chance of having at least 7 of a particular digit. Since I have one 1 and there are 16 digits remaining in other players' hands, it's possible they have more 1s or other higher digits. My hand contains digits 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9. I can see that I have a 2 and other digits, but no other 1s. Bidding 6 2s is a valid move as it increases the digit. However, considering my hand and the fact that I have a 2, 3, and other digits, bidding 6 2s or even 6 3s could be reasonable. Yet, I should be cautious not to bid too high without a strong basis. Since I have one 1 and the bid is 6 1s, and I have a 2 and a 3, bidding 6 2s seems like a reasonable next step as it is a minimal increase in the digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. There are 24 total digits remaining across 3 players. The expected number of any digit is 2.4 (24 / 10). A bid of 6 2s is 2.5 times the expected value, which is quite high. My hand (16200370) contains only one 2. For the bid of 6 2s to be true, the other two players must have a combined total of at least 5 more 2s among their 16 digits. The probability of getting 5 or more 2s in 16 random digits (each with a 1/10 chance) is very low (approximately 1.8%). The overall probability of having 6 or more 2s in 24 digits is also low (approximately 3%). While I could make a higher bid, such as 7 0s (based on having three 0s), the probability of that bid being true (needing 4+ more 0s from 16 digits, approx 6.8%) is also not high. Given the low probability of the current bid of 6 2s being true, challenging is the most strategic move.

With 16 total digits and only one 0 in my hand, for there to be 4 or more 0s, Player 3 would need to have at least 3 zeros in their 8 digits, which is possible but not highly likely. However, since the bid is not outlandish and it's early in the round, I can safely make a higher bid using a digit that I have more of. I have two 2s in my hand, so I will raise to 4 2s, matching the quantity but increasing the digit.
