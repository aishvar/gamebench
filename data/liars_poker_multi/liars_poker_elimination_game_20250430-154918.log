Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round. My hand contains three 9s and three 5s. Bidding 4 9s is a reasonable opening bid, slightly higher than my count of 9s but not overly aggressive given there are 48 total digits among 6 players.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 2, 9, 6, 8, 4, 8, 8, 6. I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 4 9s. Since I only have one 9, it is impossible for the total to reach 4 9s across all players. Challenging the bid is the best move, as the bid is highly unlikely to be true given my hand and the total number of digits remaining.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count per digit is 4. Bidding 4 9s is a plausible opening bid, slightly exceeding my hand count but aligning with the average expectation across all players. It also sets a reasonably high starting point for the round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 9s and knowing that in the previous round, the actual count of 9s was 7, which is higher than the bid, it suggests that Player 0 might have a good understanding of the distribution of digits. However, since the total number of digits remaining is 40 and we are bidding on the total count across all players, bidding higher than 4 on any digit, especially on 9 which has already been bid, seems risky. Considering my hand, 83008638, I have no 9s but I do have digits that could potentially be part of a higher bid if I choose a different digit. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40 and we are at a relatively low quantity of 4 for the digit 9, there's room to increase the quantity or switch to a higher digit. But without more information on the distribution of other digits, challenging seems like a safer bet, especially since the last challenge resulted in a win for the bidder due to a higher actual count than bid. However, considering the rules and the fact that I need to make a strictly higher bid or challenge, and given that my hand does not provide strong evidence for a higher bid on 9s but does contain other digits, I should think about increasing the quantity or changing the digit to something I have more of or something higher if possible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 39093891, which contains two 9s and two 3s, but no 0s. The current bid is 5 0s by Player 2. Given that there are 40 total digits across all players, a bid of 5 0s is plausible as it represents only 12.5% of the total digits, which is not excessively high. I don't have any 0s myself, but statistically, it's reasonable to expect at least 5 zeros across all hands. Challenging now might be risky since the bid isn't outrageously high. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. Since my strongest digits are 9s and 3s with two each, I’ll bid on 9s to leverage my hand and increase both the quantity and the digit. I’ll bid 6 9s, which is a step up from 5 0s in terms of quantity and digit value. This keeps the bid plausible while putting pressure on the next player.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. Given my hand contains a 9, I can make a valid higher bid by increasing the quantity to 7, as I have one 9 and at least one other player may have a 9. This is a reasonable strategy.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s made by Player 4. I have zero 9s in my hand, so there are only 32 unknown digits. Even with a 10% base rate, the expected count is about 3.2 and getting at least 7 is over two standard deviations above the mean. The bid is extremely unlikely and appears to be a bluff. I should challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. Bidding 3 4s is a safe opening—no matter the other hands, the total is at least 3, and it’s a reasonable quantity given 32 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. My hand contains three 9s. With 32 total digits remaining, the average count for any digit is 3.2. I need at least one more 9 from the other 24 digits for a bid of 4 9s to be true. The average expectation for 9s in the other 24 digits is 2.4, making it very likely that at least one more 9 exists. The game history also shows relatively high counts of 9s in previous rounds (7 and 6), suggesting they might be concentrated among the remaining players. Bidding 4 9s is a strong, plausible bid based on my hand and available information, and is a valid higher bid than 3 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 9s' and my hand '83008638', I notice that I have no 9s. Considering the total digits remaining is 32 and there are 4 active players, each having 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 32. Since the bid '4 9s' is relatively low and I have no information that would suggest a high count of 9s, I should consider challenging. However, since I don't have any 9s and given that a challenge could lead to my elimination if the count is indeed 4 or more, I must weigh the risks. Given that '4 9s' has been bid before and the challenger lost, it might indicate that there could indeed be a significant number of 9s. Thus, making a higher bid seems more prudent than challenging directly. Looking at my hand, I see I have multiple 8s and 0s but no 9s. Since I need to make a strictly higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Given that bidding on a digit higher than 9 is not possible, I must increase the quantity. However, increasing the quantity on 9s directly is risky without having any in my hand. Therefore, I should look for a digit that I have in abundance and try to make a reasonable bid. Since I have three 8s and an 0, and considering the bid needs to be higher than '4 9s', I could consider bidding on 8s or 0s but must do so in a way that is higher than the current bid. Bidding '5 8s' would be a higher bid because it increases the quantity while maintaining a high digit, which seems reasonable given my hand and the need to surpass '4 9s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 39093891, which contains two 9s, two 3s, two 1s, one 0, and one 8. The current bid is 5 8s by Player 2. I only have one 8 in my hand, which means at least four 8s must be in the other players' hands for the bid to hold. With a total of 32 digits across 4 players, and considering that each player has 8 digits, the likelihood of four more 8s existing seems plausible but not certain. However, looking at the bidding history, there seems to be a pattern of aggressive bidding on high digits like 9s. I could challenge, but the risk is high since 5 8s is not an extreme bid with 32 total digits. Instead, I will make a higher bid of 6 9s, leveraging the two 9s in my hand and the historical focus on 9s, which might suggest more 9s are out there. This bid increases the quantity and switches to a higher digit, making it a valid higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand and there are only 32 cards total (24 in other hands). Even with ideal distribution, the chance of there being at least six 9s among the other players is extremely low (around 2%). Therefore Player 3’s bid of 6 9s is almost certainly a bluff and I should challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet in this round and I am starting the bidding, I need to make a reasonable initial bid based on my hand. My hand is 39093891, which contains three 9s. With a total of 24 digits across all players, bidding 4 9s seems like a safe starting point, as it is plausible that at least one more 9 exists among the other players' hands. This bid leverages my strong count of 9s while keeping the quantity conservative to avoid an early challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I hold three 9s in my hand. This means only one more 9 is needed from the other 16 digits for the current bid to be true. Challenging this bid is risky as it's very likely there is at least one more 9 among the other players. Therefore, I should make a higher bid. Bidding 5 9s requires a total of five 9s, meaning two more 9s are needed from the remaining 16 digits. This is a plausible quantity based on my hand strength in 9s, and it's a direct escalation of the current bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 9s and my hand containing 83008638, I have no 9s. Considering the total digits remaining is 24 and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24, bidding a higher quantity of 9s seems unlikely. However, I must consider the possibility of other players having 9s. Since the current bid is already high and I don't have any 9s, challenging seems like a reasonable option, especially given that the total number of digits left is limited and other players might not have enough 9s to meet the bid.

My strongest digits are 9s (three) and 5s (three). With 16 total digits, the expected count for any digit is around 1.6. Having three of a digit is strong. Bidding 4 9s is a reasonable starting bid, slightly above my count but well-supported by my hand, and aligns with the game history where 9s have been frequently bid upon and have had high counts.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 39093891, which contains three 9s. The current bid by Player 0 is 4 9s. Since there are only 16 total digits remaining across both players, and I have three 9s, Player 0 must have at least one 9 for the bid to hold. This is plausible given the history of bids on 9s being frequently high and successful. However, I can make a higher bid to push the game forward. Bidding 5 9s seems reasonable since I already contribute three 9s, and it's possible Player 0 has one or two more. If Player 0 challenges, there's a fair chance the total is at least 5 based on past rounds where 9s were often numerous.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s made by Player 3. I have three 9s in my hand (09995551). With 16 total digits remaining (8 in my hand, 8 in Player 3's hand), Player 3's bid implies there are at least 5 nines in total. Since I have 3 nines, Player 3 must have at least 5 - 3 = 2 nines in their hand for the bid to be true. Looking at the game history, the total count of 9s has consistently been high in previous rounds (7, 6, 6, 6). Given this history, it is quite plausible, perhaps even likely, that the total number of 9s in the current 16 digits is 5 or more. Therefore, challenging the bid of 5 9s would be risky. I need to make a higher bid. The next possible bid is 6 of any digit, or 5 of a higher digit (not possible as 9 is highest). I have three 9s and three 5s. Bidding 6 9s would claim there are at least 6 nines in total, requiring Player 3 to have at least 6 - 3 = 3 nines. Given the history of total 9s often being 6 or 7, it is plausible that Player 3 has 3 or 4 nines. Bidding 6 5s would require Player 3 to have at least 6 - 3 = 3 fives, which is less supported by the historical data compared to the high frequency of 9s. Therefore, bidding 6 9s is the most strategic and plausible move based on my hand and the game history.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 39093891, which contains four 9s. The current bid by Player 0 is 6 9s, and with only 16 total digits remaining across both players, the maximum possible number of 9s is 16. Since I have four 9s, Player 0 must have at least two 9s for the bid of 6 to be true. Given the bidding history, Player 0 has consistently bid high on 9s, and previous rounds show that the count of 9s has often been around 6 or 7 when more players were in the game. With only two players now, it's plausible that Player 0 has a couple of 9s, making the total of 6 achievable. However, I can make a higher bid of 7 9s, which is still within the realm of possibility if Player 0 has three 9s. This bid pressures Player 0 to either challenge or bid even higher, potentially pushing them into an unlikely bid. I will avoid challenging since 6 9s is plausible with my four 9s contributing significantly to the count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. I have three 9s in my hand. This means Player 3 must have at least 4 nines in their hand of 8 digits for the bid to be true. The probability of a player having 4 or more of a specific digit in 8 random digits is very low (less than 0.5%). Additionally, the game history shows the actual count of 9s has been 6 in previous rounds with larger pools of digits (40, 32, 24). Given the low probability of Player 3 holding 4+ nines and the historical actual count being 6, it is highly improbable that the total count of 9s is 7 or more in a pool of only 16 digits. Bidding higher (e.g., 8 of any digit) is even less likely to be true. Therefore, challenging the bid is the most strategic move.
