Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I open the bidding. I see three 0s in my own eight digits. With 48 digits total in play, the average count for any specific digit is about five, so needing just three more 0s among the remaining 40 cards is very likely. Starting at 6 0s is plausible but still high enough to keep some pressure on the other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I don't have any 0s in my hand. Since it's early in the game and the bid is relatively low, I will make a slightly higher bid. I will bid 7 1s, as I have one 1 in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s. I have two 1s in my hand (digits: 0 4 2 3 1 3 5 4), which supports the plausibility of the bid. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Increasing the quantity to 8 0s is a good move since 0s are common and I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 8 0s is strictly higher than 7 1s and seems reasonable given the total digits and my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 0s. I have two 0s in my hand (from 73669168). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 48 total digits and 8 0s are already bid, it's plausible that there are at least 8 0s. However, increasing the quantity to 9 seems risky. I can bid 8 1s, keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit. I have one 1 in my hand, so it's possible others have 1s as well.

Player 0 Reasoning: I hold exactly two 1s in my own hand. By increasing the bid to 2 1s I strictly raise the quantity while keeping the digit the same. Because I already meet the bid on my own, any immediate challenge would automatically fail for the challenger, giving me a risk-free position while still keeping the overall bid reasonably low for flexibility in later turns.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. I could bid 3 1s, or I could bid a higher digit. I will bid 3 2s. It's a slightly safer play than bidding 3 1s, as someone might have a lot of 1s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have one '2' in my hand. Given there are 40 digits total and 5 players, it's reasonable to expect at least 3 '2's in total. To increase the bid, I can either raise the quantity or the digit. Bidding 3 3s would be a higher digit with the same quantity, but I only have one '3'. Bidding 4 0s is a higher quantity and a safe digit since I have two '0's in my hand. Therefore, bidding 4 0s is a valid and reasonable move.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have the digits 0, 4, 2, 3, 1, 3, 5, 4 in my hand, including two 3s and two 4s. Since there are 32 digits in total, bidding a moderate quantity that reflects a common digit seems reasonable. Starting with a bid of 3 3s is a safe opening, as it is not too high to be easily challenged but shows confidence based on my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains a 3 and a 4. The current bid is 3 3s. Bidding 3 4s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages the presence of a 4 in my hand and challenges the likelihood of the current bid being accurate.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold three 0s myself and the current bid is only 3 4s. With 24 unknown digits among the other three players, the odds that at least one more 0 is present are high, giving a strong chance that there are 4 or more 0s in total. Raising the quantity to 4 while switching to the digit I’m strongest in both satisfies the requirement to beat the current bid and leaves me with a bid I’m comfortable defending if challenged.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I don't have any 0s in my hand. I could bid 4 of a higher number, such as 4 1s, or I could bid 5 0s. Since I don't have any 0s, bidding 5 0s seems risky. I'll bid 4 1s, as I have one 1 in my hand, and there are 32 total digits, so it's plausible there are at least four 1s in total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one '1' in my hand, so the bid might be plausible but not guaranteed. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. The next higher bid after 4 1s is 4 2s or 5 0s. I have two '3's and one '4' in my hand, but no '2's or '0's. Bidding 4 2s seems risky since I have no '2's. Bidding 4 2s is the minimal increase but I don't have '2's. Bidding 5 0s is a bigger jump but '0's might be common. I have one '0' in my hand. Given that 4 1s is a moderate bid and the game history shows bids around this level, I will raise the quantity to 5 and bid on '0's, which I have at least one of, making it a reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. My hand contains a 0 and a 1. Bidding 5 1s is a valid higher bid since it matches the quantity (5) but increases the digit (1 > 0). This leverages my existing 1 while avoiding overcommitting to zeros, which may be less certain. Challenging is risky without clear evidence of a bluff.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:0 - o3-2025-04-16) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand. The current bid is 5 1s; with the two 1s I hold, only three more 1s would be needed among the remaining 24 digits, so a challenge is far from certain to succeed. Instead, zeros look strong: Player 2 already felt confident enough to bid 5 0s, suggesting extra 0s out there. By moving the bid to 6 0s I leverage my own three 0s—only three more are required across the other players’ 24 unseen digits, which is quite plausible. Raising the quantity keeps me safe from an immediate challenge on ones and plays to the apparent abundance of zeros.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have no 0s in my hand. I could challenge, but it's not a particularly high bid, and someone else might have a few. I will bid slightly higher, increasing the digit to 1, and the quantity to 7, since there have been a few bids on 1s already.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s. I have only one '1' in my hand, so the bid is quite high, but still plausible given there are 32 digits total. I need to make a higher bid. Increasing the quantity to 8 is the next valid step, and bidding 8 0s is a reasonable move since I have two '0's in my hand, and '0' is the lowest digit, making it a strong bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, but with 32 total digits across four players, achieving 8 zeros would require an average of 2 zeros per player. Given the previous challenges and the high likelihood of bluffing, it's reasonable to challenge the bid. If the actual count is less than 8, I win; otherwise, I risk elimination. However, the high bid seems improbable given the game's progression.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. My hand contains one 1, but the total count across all players is uncertain.

Player 0 Reasoning: I can see three 0s in my own hand (0,0,0). Therefore there are at least three zeros among the 16 total digits, no matter what Player 1 holds. The current bid is only 1 5s, so I must raise. Jumping to 3 0s both increases the quantity and switches to a digit I am certain about. Given earlier rounds, Player 1 has shown few 0s, so they may consider three zeros unlikely and might challenge, but I would win any such challenge with my guaranteed three zeros.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my eight-digit hand I count exactly three 0s. For Player 1’s bid of 4 0s to be true, they would need to have at least one 0. With eight unknown digits the chance they hold at least one 0 is roughly 57 % (1 – 0.9^8). That means the bid is more likely correct than not, but every possible legal raise I could make is even worse for me: 
• 5 0s would require the opponent to have at least two 0s, which only happens about 19 % of the time.
• Staying at quantity 4 but raising the digit (e.g., 4 1s) is still very unlikely—probability of four of any specific non-wild digit in 16 cards is around 13 %.
Given that any raise I make would almost certainly be challenged and would succeed far less often than 43 % (my winning chance if I challenge now), challenging the current bid maximizes my expected survival.
