Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 83307491, which contains two 8s and one 3 and other digits. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but not too low. I see that I have two 8s, so bidding on 8s seems like a good start. Considering there are 6 players with 8 digits each, a total of 48 digits, a bid of 3 8s seems like a reasonable initial bid as it slightly exceeds the count I have in my hand, accounting for the possibility that other players might also have 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand out of the total 48 digits across all players. The current bid is 3 8s by Player 0, which is a relatively low bid. Given that there are 6 players with 8 digits each, it's plausible that there are at least two more 8s among the other players. I will make a higher bid to continue the game and test the waters. I'll bid 4 0s, increasing the quantity and choosing a digit I have none of to avoid giving away information about my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 4 5s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This leverages my existing 5s to create a more plausible claim than challenging, which risks elimination if the zero count is ≥4. Since I have no zeros, challenging is risky, but bidding on a digit I possess (5s) strengthens my position.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 5s' by Player 2, I must decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. My hand contains 15285367, which includes one 5. Considering the total digits remaining (48) and the fact that each player has 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 48. Since the current bid is '4 5s', to make a higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. However, without more information about the other players' hands, it's difficult to assess the likelihood of '4 5s' being true. Given that I only have one 5, challenging seems like a viable option, but let's consider making a bid first. A bid of '5 5s' would be a direct increase in quantity, which seems reasonable given that we are still in the early stages of the game and the total number of 5s could potentially be high across all players. Since my hand does not provide strong evidence against '4 5s' and I do not have enough information to confidently challenge, making a slightly higher bid seems like the best strategy at this point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I hold two 4s. Raising to 6 4s means I need at least four more 4s among the 40 unknown cards. With an expected 4 4s, the chance of ≥4 is about 57%, making this the strongest credible increase over 5 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. I don't have any 4s in my hand. To bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. I could bid 6 of a higher digit, or 7 of any digit. Given that the bids have been escalating fairly quickly, and I don't have any strong information about the distribution of digits, I'll make a conservative bid of 7 0s. This is a small increase, but it keeps me in the game.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Given that there are 48 total digits and 6 players, the maximum count for any digit is 48. A bid of 7 0s implies that at least 7 zeros exist across all hands. Since I have one 0, there are 7 other players' digits that could potentially be 0s. Bidding 8 0s seems too high because it implies a very high count of 0s across other players' hands. However, bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity is a viable option. I can bid 7 1s. This is a safer bet as it doesn't increase the quantity, just the digit. I will choose to bid 7 1s as it's a reasonable next step.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 1s made by Player 0. In my hand, I have two 1s, which contributes to the total count. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average number of any digit across all hands would be around 4.8. A bid of 7 1s is slightly above average but not unreasonable. However, since the bid is still relatively low compared to the maximum possible, I can safely make a higher bid. I will bid 8 1s, increasing the quantity while staying on the same digit, as I have some support for 1s in my hand and it keeps the bid plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s. My hand contains zero 1s, and the expected total number of 1s across 48 digits is ~4.8. Bidding 8 1s is statistically unlikely. Challenging forces a reveal, and if the bid is false, Player 1 is eliminated. The risk of losing by challenging is balanced by the low probability of 8 1s existing, especially with my hand having none.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: As the first bidder in the round, I need to establish a reasonable starting bid. My hand contains three 8s, which is the highest count of any digit. Bidding 4 8s is plausible since it only requires one additional 8 from the other players' hands. This bid is conservative given the average of 4 digits per number (40 total digits / 10 possible digits) and leverages my strong holdings in 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 8s and my hand containing one 8, I must assess the likelihood of this bid being true. With 40 total digits remaining and 5 players, including myself, the maximum number of 8s any single player could have is 8 (if they had all 8s). Considering the bidding history, especially the challenge that led to Player 1's elimination, players seem cautious. My hand has one 8, which slightly increases the likelihood of the bid being valid, but not significantly. However, without more information about other players' hands, bidding higher than 4 8s could be risky. Given that I have no 9s and bidding the same quantity with a higher digit is an option, I could consider bidding 4 9s if I thought it was plausible. Since my hand does not contain any 9s and given the total number of digits remaining, it seems unlikely that there would be four 9s. Therefore, challenging the current bid seems like the most strategic move, as the presence of four 8s across all hands, while possible, is not guaranteed, especially considering the distribution of digits and the previous elimination due to an overbid.

Player 2 Reasoning: As the starting player, I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 5s, two 8s, and two 9s. Bidding 4 5s is reasonable because I have two, and it's plausible others have at least one or two more. This bid is conservative yet allows room for escalation.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 24 total digits and 3 players, a bid of 4 5s suggests a moderate count of 5s. I can see I have one 5. Increasing the quantity seems risky without more information about other digits. However, I can bid 4 6s, keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit, which is a safer move given my hand doesn't have information about 6s in other hands.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 4 8s leverages my two 8s and increases the digit value, making it harder for opponents to meet. With 24 total digits, four 8s is plausible given my two and potential distribution among others. Challenging 4 6s carries moderate risk since the expected number of 6s is low but not impossible.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. It is possible there are at least four 8s in total, but it's less likely. I could bid higher, but I'm unsure. Given the game history of challenges, and the relatively low number of total digits remaining (24), I think there's a reasonable chance that Player 2 is bluffing. Therefore, I will challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: As the starting player, I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 5s, two 8s, and two 9s. Bidding '3 5s' is a reasonable starting point since I have two 5s, implying the other player likely has at least one.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s by Player 2. I have the hand 83307491, which contains one 5. So, the total count of 5s is at least 1 (mine) + unknown (Player 2's hand). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have one 8 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 5s, I can bid 3 8s, increasing the digit. This seems like a reasonable bid given my hand and the current state.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s by Player 0. Since I have two 8s, there must be at least one 8 in Player 0's hand to meet the bid. Bidding 4 8s increases the quantity while keeping the same digit, which is defensible given my hand and the likelihood of Player 0 having at least two 8s. Challenging the current bid risks losing if Player 0 actually has one 8, making the bid true.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 2. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that there are 16 digits in total and I have seen one 8, it's plausible that the total count of 8s is at least 4. However, I should consider if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more appropriate. Since I can bid higher than 4 8s by either increasing the quantity or the digit, I will analyze my hand. My hand is 83307491, which contains one 8. To make a higher bid, I can either bid a higher quantity of 8s or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. Bidding 5 8s is a possibility if I believe there's a good chance of having at least 5 8s in total. However, given that I only have one 8, and there are 8 digits left with Player 2, it's possible they have 3 more 8s, making 4 8s a reasonable bid. I will increase the digit instead, as it's a safer move. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s by Player 2. I have two 8s in my hand (from 83307491), so the total count of 8s must be at least 2. Given that there are 16 digits in total and I have seen my own hand, I need to assess the likelihood of the total count being 5 or more 8s. Since I have two 8s, Player 2 must have at least 3 more 8s for the bid to be valid. While it's possible, it seems a bit high. However, challenging would risk losing if the count is indeed 5 or more. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. I will make a higher bid by increasing the quantity, as I have a relatively high digit (9) in my hand and the quantity isn't extremely high yet.
