Player 0 Reasoning: There are 48 digits remaining across 6 players. With no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 8s in my hand. Assuming an even distribution, there might be around 8 eights in total. I'll start with a bid of 5 8s, which is cautious but reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, which is a good start. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total), having 5 8s total seems quite reasonable. Since I already account for 2 of the 5 needed, it's likely the other 4 players collectively have at least 3 more 8s. I could bid higher, but I'll bid '6 8s' to increase the quantity while staying in a relatively safe range.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. My hand contains no 8s, and the expected total number of 8s across all 48 digits is approximately 4.8. A bid of 6 8s is statistically unlikely, especially with no 8s in my hand. Challenging this bid is a calculated risk based on probability.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, which is a good starting point. With 5 active players and 8 digits each (40 total), a conservative opening bid would be reasonable. Since I won the last challenge with 6 8s when there were 48 total digits, I should start lower now that there are only 40 digits. Starting with 4 8s is a safe bid - it's likely given my two 8s, and leaves room for others to bid up.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. There are 5 players and 40 total digits, making the expected quantity for any digit 4. The bid is exactly the expected average. I have zero 8s in my hand (40244624). For the bid to be true, the other 4 players (32 digits) must hold at least four 8s. The expected number of 8s among those 32 digits is 3.2, so the bid is plausible and challenging is risky. My hand is very strong in 4s, containing four 4s. Bidding based on my strength is a good strategy. A bid of 5 4s requires only one more 4 among the remaining 32 digits held by other players. Since the expected number of 4s in those digits is 3.2, finding at least one more is highly likely. This bid is higher than 4 8s and is well-supported by my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have a 5 in my hand, so bidding 5 5s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid and strategic move. This leverages my existing digits without overcommitting to a higher quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is '5 5s' made by Player 4. I have a total of 8 digits in my hand: 8, 2, 0, 0, 4, 1, 3, 5. I see that I have one 5 and two 0s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40 and there are 40 total digits remaining, bidding a high quantity seems risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding a higher digit with a reasonable quantity might be a safer approach. Since I have two 0s, bidding on 0 seems reasonable. The current bid is quantity 5, so I need to bid at least quantity 6 or higher to increase the quantity, or bid 5 with a higher digit. I will bid '6 0s' as my next action.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have two 0s in my hand. Since there are 40 digits remaining across 5 players, it's plausible that there are at least 7 0s. However, bidding 7 0s seems too risky as I only have two 0s. I should challenge the bid, as it's unlikely that Player 5 has enough 0s to support their bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', which means I can make any initial bid. I have the digits 8, 2, 0, 0, 4, 1, 3, 5 in my hand. I see that there are 32 total digits remaining across 4 players. Making a bid of '4 0s' seems reasonable since I have two 0s and there are enough digits left to potentially validate a bid of this quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have one 0. Given the previous round where Player 5 correctly bid 6 0s (and won the challenge), they likely have multiple 0s. The current bid of 4 0s is quite conservative compared to the proven 6 0s from last round, even with fewer total digits. With my one 0 and Player 5's likely multiple 0s, 4 0s is probably valid. I should make a higher bid. Since I have two 4s in my hand, bidding 4 4s is a safe play - it keeps the same quantity but uses a higher digit that I know I have multiple copies of.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. My hand is 40244624, which contains four 4s. This means the current bid is already met just by the digits I hold. Challenging this bid would be unwise as it's almost certainly true (there are likely more 4s among the other 24 digits). I need to make a higher bid. Since I have four 4s, increasing the bid to 5 4s is a very safe and logical next step. It only requires one more 4 to exist among the other 24 digits held by the other three players, which is highly probable.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. My hand contains one 5, and bidding 5 5s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages the possibility that others may have more 5s, and it avoids challenging without sufficient evidence.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s made by Player 4. I have a 5 in my hand, and considering the total digits remaining is 32, it's possible that other players have multiple 5s as well. However, bidding higher than 5 requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. I can see that my hand contains a 5, and there are other high digits in my hand as well. I will increase the quantity and bid 6 5s because it seems plausible given the distribution of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I only see one 5, and the current bid claims there are 6 fives total. With 32 digits in play (8 per player, 4 players), this means the other players would need to have 5 more fives between them. While possible, this seems unlikely given: 1) Previous bidding behavior suggests players aren't extremely confident in 5s, 2) The bid progression to 6 5s feels like a bluff to force a difficult decision, 3) My hand having only one 5 makes it less likely others have many 5s. The probability of 5 more fives in 24 remaining digits (32 - my 8) is relatively low.

Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have: one 0, one 1, one 4 (twice), one 5, one 6, and one 8. Since I'm starting the round with 3 players (24 total digits), and I have two 4s in my hand, bidding 4 4s seems like a safe opening move. This represents a reasonable quantity that accounts for my known 4s while leaving room for other players to potentially have more.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I hold three 4s in my hand (40244624). The current bid is 4 4s, made by Player 1. For this bid to be true, only one more 4 is needed among the remaining 16 digits held by Player 1 and Player 4. Given my hand, this is highly probable (expected number of 4s in the other 16 digits is 1.6). Therefore, challenging is risky. A higher bid is required. Bidding 5 4s is a natural progression. It requires two more 4s among the other 16 digits. Since Player 1 bid 4 4s, they likely have at least one 4, making the total count potentially 5 or more. Bidding 5 4s leverages my strong hand and puts pressure on the next player.

Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have only one 5. For the current bid of '5 5s' to be valid, there would need to be 4 more 5s between the other two players (each with 8 digits). While possible, this seems unlikely. Looking at the game history, Player 4 has shown a pattern of making risky bids. Additionally, in previous rounds when I had good information (like the 8s count), bids were accurate. Given I can see only one 5 in my hand of 8 digits, and there are only 16 other digits in play, having 4 more 5s seems improbable. The safer play is to challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s made by Player 1. I have four 4s in my hand (40244624). This means the actual total count of 4s across both hands (16 digits total) is guaranteed to be at least 4. Therefore, challenging the bid of 3 4s would result in me losing. I must make a higher bid. Bidding 4 4s is a safe and truthful bid, as my hand alone satisfies this quantity. This forces Player 1 to make a higher bid or challenge, while my bid is unchallengeable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand (60514485). The current bid of 4 4s by Player 3 means they're claiming there are at least 4 fours total between our 16 digits. Since I only have 2 fours, Player 3 would need to have at least 2 more fours for their bid to be true. While possible, this seems unlikely given that 4s aren't particularly common in my hand and they would need exactly the right distribution. The previous rounds also show Player 3 being aggressive with bids. Given these factors, challenging seems like the best option.
