Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid. My hand is 73968368, containing two 3s, two 6s, and two 8s. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total digits), the statistical average for any digit is 4.8. A safe opening bid is typically around this average or slightly below, leveraging digits present in my hand. I have two 3s. Bidding '4 3s' is a reasonable starting point, slightly below the expected average but supported by my hand, leaving room for future bids.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. With 48 total digits, the expected count of any digit is about 4.8, so even after my two 6s there are likely at least two more among the other 40 cards. Bidding 4 6s minimally raises the digit over 3 while being supported by my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 1. I have the hand 21817462, which contains two 6s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have some information about my own hand, I can see that I have two 6s, making the current bid of 4 6s somewhat plausible because there are 6 other players. I will increase the digit to make a higher bid. Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable next step as it is a higher bid than 4 6s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Since the quantity is already at 4, I need to bid higher than 4. Bidding 5 0s seems like a safe and reasonable increment without being overly aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze if the current bid of '5 0s' is reasonable. In my hand, I have one 0, which means there would need to be at least 4 more 0s among the other 5 players (40 digits total) for the bid to be valid. This is certainly possible as each player has 8 digits, and 0s are common. The bidding has been relatively conservative so far (4 3s, 4 6s, 4 7s, then 5 0s), suggesting players are making reasonable bids. I could challenge, but it's too risky at this early stage. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (15009828), I have two 8s, which gives me confidence to bid on 8s. I'll bid '5 8s' to maintain the same quantity but increase the digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s, and I have one 8 in my hand. While 5 8s seems plausible, it's not a certainty. However, challenging would be risky as I only have one 8. Instead, I should try to increase the bid. I have two 2s in my hand, so bidding 6 2s is a reasonable move, increasing the quantity and using a digit I have in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. I have zero 2s in my hand (73968368). The total expected number of 2s across all 48 digits is 4.8. For the bid to be true, the other 5 players (40 digits) must hold at least six 2s. The expected number of 2s among those 40 digits is 4. While 6 is higher than expected, it's not impossibly high, making a challenge risky. I should make a higher bid based on my hand. I have two 3s, two 6s, and two 8s. Bidding 6 3s, 6 6s, or 6 8s seems statistically safe (my 2 + expected 4 among others = 6). Player 4 previously bid 5 8s, suggesting there might be a concentration of 8s. Bidding 6 8s is a valid step up from 6 2s, is supported by my hand, and builds on previous information.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand. The current bid of 6 8s means all 6 must be among the other 40 cards, and the chance of at least six 8s in 40 uniform digits is only about 20â€“25%, making this bid unlikely to be true. I should challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round. My hand contains two 3s, two 6s, and two 8s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. The expected average count for any digit is 4. I hold two 8s. Bidding '3 8s' is a safe opening bid, as it's below the expected average but is strongly supported by my hand (having 2 out of the required 3). It also starts the bidding at a relatively high digit for the quantity, potentially influencing subsequent bids.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 8s in my hand (21817462). The total count of 8s across all 5 players must be at least 10 (2 * 5), but it's possible that other players have more 8s or other digits. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 8s, I can reasonably bid higher on 8s or switch to a higher digit. Bidding 4 8s seems plausible as it increases the quantity.

Player 4 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (15009828), I have one 0 and two 8s. The current bid is '5 0s', which means Player 3 believes there are at least 5 zeros among all players' hands. With 5 active players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. I only have one 0 in my hand, so there would need to be at least 4 more zeros in the other players' hands for this bid to be valid. This is certainly possible, especially since Player 3 might have several zeros in their hand to make such a bid. Looking at the previous round, there were 6 8s total when there were 6 players. Now with 5 players, I know I have two 8s, so there are likely at least 3-4 more 8s among other players. I could bid '5 8s', which would be valid and based on my knowledge of having two 8s. This seems safer than challenging the '5 0s' bid, which could very well be accurate.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have two 2s in my hand. The previous bid of 6 2s by Player 5 was successful, indicating that there are likely at least 6 2s in total. Bidding 6 3s seems reasonable, as it increases the digit while maintaining the quantity. However, I can see that there are only 40 digits remaining and 5 players, so there are 8 digits per player. Since 5 8s is already bid, there are at most 35 digits remaining. Since 35 - 5*5 = 10 digits remaining, and there are only 5 players, I can challenge the bid of 5 8s.

Player 4 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (15009828), I have two 8s, one 0, one 1, one 5, one 9, and one 2. Since 8s are my most frequent digit, I'll start with a conservative bid based on what I know for certain. With two 8s in my hand, there could be more among the other players. A bid of 3 8s seems reasonable as a starting point - it's not too aggressive but establishes a digit I have multiple of.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 4. I hold two 8s in my hand (73968368). With 4 players and 32 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 3.2. Given my two 8s, the expected total number of 8s is approximately 2 (mine) + (24 remaining digits / 10) = 2 + 2.4 = 4.4. Since the expected count is well above 3, challenging the current bid of 3 8s is risky. Player 4's bid of 3 8s suggests they might hold at least one 8. Combined with my two 8s, this already accounts for three 8s. Therefore, bidding 4 8s is a statistically reasonable increase, leveraging my strong holding in 8s and building upon the previous bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 0. I have the hand 21817462, which contains two 8s. Given that there are 32 total digits and I have 2 eights, it's plausible that the total count of 8s is at least 4. However, bidding higher than 4 8s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. I can see that my hand doesn't have a high frequency of digits higher than 8, but I can still bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Bidding 5 8s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand (the third digit). Player 3 has bid 6 0s, meaning there should be 6 zeros across all 32 digits. Given that I have only 1 zero, there would need to be 5 more zeros among the other 24 digits held by the other players. This is certainly possible (about 1 zero per 5 digits for others), but not guaranteed. However, I also notice that 8s have been bid frequently in previous rounds, suggesting they might be common. I have two 8s in my hand, so I could bid 6 8s, which is higher than 6 0s because the digit is higher. This seems like a safer move than challenging the 6 0s bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s with 4 players (32 total digits). I hold two 8s (73968368). This means the other 3 players (24 digits) must hold at least four 8s for the bid to be true. The average number of any digit is 3.2 (32/10). The bid requires significantly more 8s (4) from the other players than the average (2.4). Player 4 bid 3 8s, I bid 4 8s, Player 2 bid 5 8s, Player 3 switched to 6 0s, and Player 4 jumped back to 6 8s. Player 3's switch suggests they may not hold many 8s. Player 4's jump back to 8s at the 6-level seems aggressive and could be a bluff. While previous rounds showed 6 eights existed with more players/digits, it's less likely with only 32 digits. Estimating based on bids (Me: 2, P4: ~1-2, P2: ~1-2, P3: ~0-1), the total is likely closer to 4 or 5 than 6. Bidding higher (e.g., 6 9s or 7 of anything) seems very risky. Therefore, challenging the high bid of 6 8s is the most statistically sound move.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 4. My hand is 21817462, which contains one 8. I have 8 digits, and there are 8 digits for each of the other two players, making a total of 24 digits. The current bid of 3 8s is relatively low considering the total number of digits. I can see that I have one 8, so the total count of 8s must be at least 1. Given that there are 16 digits held by the other two players, it's plausible that there are at least 3 8s in total. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since 8 is a relatively high digit and my hand doesn't give me strong confidence in a much higher quantity of 8s, I will consider bidding 3 9s, which is a higher bid due to the higher digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. In my hand (15009828), I have one 0. The current bid is 4 0s, which means Player 3 is claiming there are at least 4 zeros among all players' hands. Since I have 1 zero, that means there would need to be at least 3 more zeros between Player 2 and Player 3 (who have 16 digits combined). This is certainly possible. Looking at the history, I notice Player 3 has bid on zeros before (5 0s and 6 0s in previous rounds), which might indicate they have some zeros. I also have two 8s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 8s. I could bid 4 8s, which would be higher than 4 0s because the digit is higher. Given my knowledge of my own hand and the previous bidding patterns, this seems like a reasonable move.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 4. My hand is 21817462, which contains one 8. I previously bid 3 9s. To make a higher bid than 4 8s, I need to bid either a higher quantity with the same digit or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since I have one 8 and there are two other players, it's possible they have more 8s, making a total count of at least 4 plausible. However, bidding more than 4 8s seems risky given the total count of 24 digits. I can bid 4 9s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have 8 digits in my hand: 15009828. Looking at the current bid of '5 1s', I count only one '1' in my hand. For this bid to be valid, there would need to be at least 4 more 1s between the other two players (each with 8 digits). This is certainly possible but not guaranteed. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, one 0, one 9, one 5, and one 2. I've successfully bid on 8s multiple times in previous rounds, suggesting there might be more 8s in play. I could bid '5 8s', but that's risky since I only have two 8s myself. I could also bid '5 2s' or '5 5s', but with only one of each in my hand, that's even riskier. I could increase the quantity to '6 1s', but again, with only one 1 in my hand, that's quite risky. Given that I only have one 1 in my hand, and the bid is already at 5 1s, I think challenging is the most strategic move. It's unlikely there are 4+ more 1s between the other two players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I'm starting a new round with only two players remaining (Player 2 and myself). I have 8 digits in my hand: 15009828, which contains one 0, one 1, one 5, two 8s, one 9, and two 2s. Since I'm making the first bid of the round, I should start with something conservative but strategic. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, which means there could be more 8s in Player 2's hand. Based on previous rounds, Player 2 has shown a preference for bidding on 8s and 9s. I have one 9 in my hand, so bidding on 9s might be risky. I'll start with a modest bid on 8s since I know I have two of them.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 4. My hand is 21817462, which contains one 8. So, the total count of 8s is at least 1 (mine) + 1 (assuming Player 4 has at least one 8 to make their bid somewhat reasonable), making the count at least 2. I can bid higher than 3 8s by either increasing the quantity or the digit. Since I have no 9s, bidding 4 8s or 3 9s seems like a reasonable next step. I will choose to bid 3 9s as it is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze my hand and the current state of the game. My hand is 15009828, which contains one 0, one 1, one 5, two 8s, one 9, and two digits that are either 2 or 0. The current bid is 3 9s from Player 2. In my hand, I have one 9. For there to be at least 3 9s total, Player 2 would need to have at least 2 9s in their hand. This is possible but not guaranteed. Looking at previous rounds, Player 2 has consistently bid on 8s and 9s, suggesting they might have several of these digits. I could bid 4 0s since I have one 0 in my hand, or I could bid 4 8s since I have two 8s. However, given that I have only one 9 and the current bid is for 3 9s, I think there's a reasonable chance that Player 2 is bluffing. I'll challenge the current bid.
