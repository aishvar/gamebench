Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With 48 total digits, the expected number of 8s is about 4.8. Bidding 4 8s is below expectation, and since I have 2, I only need 2 more among the 40 unknown digits, making this a safe opening bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 5 8s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have enough 8s to support this bid. Alternatively, I could bid a lower quantity on a different digit, but increasing the 8s seems strategically sound given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 8s in my hand, making it less likely that there are at least 5 8s among all 48 digits, though it's still plausible. However, since there are 40 unknown digits and the bid is not extreme, it's risky to challenge this early. The next valid bid would be 5 9s or 6 0s. I have two 1s in my hand, so bidding 6 1s leverages my own cards and makes a reasonable incremental bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. My hand contains no 1s, and with 5 other players holding 40 digits, the expected number of 1s is 4 (40 * 1/10). Bidding 6 1s is statistically unlikely. Challenging is justified as the bid is likely false.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: As the starting bidder, I need to make a conservative bid based on my hand. My hand contains two 3s, so bidding 3 3s is a reasonable starting point. This bid is low enough to be plausible but allows for escalation. With 5 players, it's likely there are at least three 3s total (including my two).

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Increasing the digit to 4 with the same quantity is a safe move. I don't have any 4s, but bidding 3 4s is a reasonable increment and not too risky given the total number of digits (40).

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: In my hand of 57874756, I have two 4s. The current bid is 3 4s, which means Player 4 thinks there are at least 3 fours total. Given I have 2 fours myself, this bid is very likely true. Since I know the bid is probably valid, challenging would be risky. I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have three 5s, so bidding '3 5s' would be a safe play - it keeps the same quantity but increases the digit, and I know it's likely true based on my hand alone.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s; raising to 3 8s is valid (same quantity but higher digit), and I only need one additional 8 among the remaining 32 cards, which is highly likely (~97%).

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable increase, as it raises the quantity while maintaining the digit. It's a plausible bid given my hand and the remaining digits. I don't have enough information to confidently challenge, and increasing the bid feels safer.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand contains two 9s and one 8. Bidding 4 9s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Since I already have two 9s, itâ€™s plausible others hold two more, making the total count likely meet the bid. Challenging 4 8s risks elimination if the bid is true, so a cautious bid is preferable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. To bid higher, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 but increase the digit. My hand has one '9'. Since the quantity is already 4, I can increase the digit to 0 with quantity 5 or keep quantity 4 and increase digit to 0 (which is not allowed since digit must be higher than 9 if quantity is same). Therefore, I must increase the quantity to 5 with any digit from 0 to 9. I have one '1' and one '0' in my hand, so bidding 5 0s is a reasonable next bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (57874756), I don't see any 0s. The current bid claims there are 5 zeros among all 40 digits. Given that I have zero 0s in my hand, this means the other 4 players would need to have at least 5 zeros between them, averaging more than 1 zero per player. While possible, this seems unlikely given the previous bidding pattern and the fact that players were comfortable bidding on 8s and 9s earlier. The bid of 5 0s feels too high, especially since Player 4 jumped from 4 9s to 5 0s, possibly trying to make a difficult-to-beat bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: In my hand, I have three 7s and two 5s. With 32 total digits in play (8 per player, 4 players), starting with a moderate bid is strategic. Since I have three 7s, bidding 4 7s is reasonable - it only requires one more 7 among the other three players' 24 digits. This is a conservative yet competitive opening bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The expected number of 7s in the other 24 digits is 2.4, and the probability of seeing three or more there (for a total of at least four) is only about 38%, making the bid unlikely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (57874756), I have three 7s. With 24 total digits in play and three active players, starting with a bid of 4 7s is a strong opening move. I know for certain there are at least 3 sevens (in my hand), and the probability of finding just one more 7 among the other 16 digits is reasonably high. This is also a bid I've successfully defended before in the previous round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have no 7s in my hand. Given the history of challenges succeeding when bids seem high, and knowing there are only 24 digits remaining across 3 players, 4 7s seems plausible but risky. I will bid 5 7s to test the waters, increasing the quantity. If Player 5 challenges, I will lose, but it's a reasonable gamble given the limited information.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand (39594083). The current bid is 5 7s. With only two other players and 16 digits remaining between them, the expected number of 7s is 1.6 (16 * 10%). Bidding 5 7s is statistically improbable. Challenging is the optimal move to test the validity of the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 3 9s is reasonable because it leverages my existing digits and sets a high-digit bid that forces the opponent to either increase the quantity or challenge. Since 9 is the highest digit, the next player can only raise the quantity, which could lead to a vulnerable bid if overestimated. This strategy balances aggression and plausibility based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: In my hand (57874756), I have zero 9s. The current bid claims there are 3 9s total between both players. Since I have none, that would mean Player 3 would need to have all 3 9s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, this seems unlikely. Additionally, Player 3's bidding pattern hasn't shown particular confidence in 9s in previous rounds. Given these factors and that I can see 0 of the claimed 3 9s, challenging is the safer option than raising the bid.
