Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a hand with digits 3, 6, 4, 7, 4, 9, 8, 7. The most frequent digit in my hand is 7 and 4, each appearing twice. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits, bidding 2 7s is a safe and reasonable starting bid as it matches my hand and is the lowest possible bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 2 7s, I have three 7s in my hand. Considering the total digits remaining, bidding 3 7s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have the digits 5, 7, 8, 9, 6, 9, 4, 4 in my hand. This means I have at least one 7, one 8, one 9, and two 4s. The current bid is 3 7s. Given my hand, I have only one 7, so I cannot support a bid of 4 7s. However, I do have 8s and 9s, which are higher digits. Bidding 3 8s seems plausible since I have at least one 8, and I can try to challenge the current bid by bidding higher in quantity or digit. Since I can't confidently claim more than one 7, and I have a higher digit (8), I will bid 3 8s, which is higher than 3 7s because the digit is higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 4 8s is a possibility, but it's risky as it relies on other players having at least two 8s. I could bid a lower quantity on a different digit, but I only have one of each digit other than 3 and 8. Increasing the digit seems more reasonable. I'll bid 3 9s, which is a valid higher bid than 3 8s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I hold three 8s in my hand. The current bid of 4 zeros can be minimally raised to 4 8s. There are 40 unknown digits and the chance of at least one more 8 among them is over 98%, making this a very safe increase while advancing the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s, which means at least four 8s exist among all 48 digits. I have two 8s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 and increase the digit. I can bid 4 9s, which is a higher digit at the same quantity, and I have one 9 in my hand, making this bid reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 0. I have 2 9s in my hand. Bidding 5 9s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand and the fact that Player 0 has already bid 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s, which is quite high. Given my hand (5,7,8,9,6,9,4,4), I already have two 9s, and the total number of 9s across all players is unlikely to reach 6, considering the other players' bids and my hand. Challenging now seems prudent, as the likelihood of there being at least 6 nines in total is low. Bidding higher would require at least 6 9s, which I cannot confidently support, and increasing the digit to 0-8 is less logical given the current bid. Therefore, challenging is the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is None. I have the digits 2, 3, 2, 9, 2, and 2 in my hand. With 40 total digits remaining, I should aim to bid on a digit that is likely to be present in at least some players' hands. Given the previous bids, I'll choose a digit that hasn't been bid on yet, and a quantity that's reasonable based on the remaining digits.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have two 2s in my hand (38348632). Bidding 4 2s is a reasonable and safe option, as it increases the quantity while staying within the realm of possibility given my hand. Bidding a higher digit would be riskier without knowing what others hold. A challenge is not warranted at this stage, as 3 2s is a plausible bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None'. I have three 3s, one 8, one 6, one 4, and two 2s. Bidding 4 2s is a reasonable starting bid, as I have two 2s myself and the total number of digits is 32. It's a conservative bid but increases the quantity from a potential '1 2s' or '2 2s' bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 2s, so bidding 4 8s is a valid raise (same quantity, higher digit). Among the 24 unknown digits, the chance of at least one more 8 is about 92%, making this a low‐risk bid that forces opponents to raise quantity to 5 or digit to 9.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s, and I must bid higher. My hand contains one 8, so the bid is plausible but not very strong. The next higher bid could be 4 9s or 5 0s. Bidding 4 9s is a reasonable step up, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. It is a safe increment given the previous bids and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have a 2 in my hand. Since the quantity is already 4, I should increase the digit to a higher value. I have a 9 in my hand, but it's already the current digit, so I should increase it to the next highest value, which is 9. However, I also have a 2 in my hand, and since 2 is lower than 9, I should increase the digit to 9. However, the current bid is 4 9s, and I don't have enough digits to increase the quantity. Therefore, I should challenge the current bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand and the current round has no bids yet. Given previous bids have gone up to 4 9s and even 5 9s successfully, starting with a bid of 2 9s is reasonable and conservative. It sets a baseline that is believable and allows me to gauge opponents' reactions.
