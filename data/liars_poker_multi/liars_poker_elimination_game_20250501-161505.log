Player 0 Reasoning: I have four 4s in my hand. With 40 unseen digits and a 1/10 chance per digit, we expect about four more 4s among opponents, giving around eight total. Bidding 5 4s is a safe, yet assertive opening.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. The expected number of any digit across all 48 cards is 4.8. I have zero 4s in my hand of 8 digits. For the bid to be true, there must be at least five 4s among the remaining 40 digits held by the other 5 players. The expected number of 4s in those 40 digits is 4.0. While 5 4s is slightly above this expectation, it's not an outlandish bid early in the game, making a challenge risky. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding '5 5s' is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid is reasonably supported by my hand (having two 5s increases the likelihood) and aligns closely with the overall expected count of 4.8. It's a safe, incremental bid that passes the decision to the next player.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 6 5s would be a valid bid, but might be too optimistic. I could also bid on a different digit. I have one 6, one 8, one 9, two 1s and two 5s. Bidding 6 6s is a reasonable option, increasing the digit. Bidding 6 4s is also possible, but Player 0 already bid 5 4s, so it's less advantageous. Since I have two 5s, I can reasonably believe there are at least 6 5s in total, and increasing the quantity seems like a good strategy.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 71609236, which contains no 5s. The current bid is 6 5s by Player 2, meaning there should be at least 6 fives across all 48 digits. Since I have none, the other 5 players must account for all 6 fives. With 8 digits each, it's possible (e.g., each could have 1 or 2 fives), but I need to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. Bidding higher, I could go to 7 5s or 6 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 6 6s feels safer as I contribute to the count. The bid of 6 5s is plausible but not extremely high, so challenging might be risky. I'll bid 6 6s to stay in the game and leverage my own digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '6 6s' made by Player 3. In my hand, I have one 6 (74706315). With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. For the bid to be valid, there need to be at least 6 sixes among all players. I already know I have 1, so there would need to be 5 more among the other 5 players, which is certainly possible (averaging 1 per player). The bid isn't suspiciously high. I could make a higher bid like '7 6s', but that would mean there are 6 more sixes among other players, which is less likely. I could also bid '6 7s', but I only have one 7 in my hand, so I don't have strong evidence for that either. Given that I don't have strong evidence for a higher bid and the current bid seems reasonable, I'll challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (74706315), I have one 7, one 4, one 7, one 0, one 6, one 3, one 1, and one 5. Based on my hand, I know there's at least one 7, one 4, one 0, one 6, one 3, one 1, and one 5 in the game. Since I have two 7s in my hand, that's my strongest digit. A conservative opening bid would be to claim there are at least 3 7s among all players, which seems reasonable given I already have two of them myself.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have a 7 in my hand, but no other 7s. Considering the total digits remaining and the fact that I have a 7, I should make a bid that increases the quantity. However, I also need to consider the possibility of other players having 7s. Since I don't have any other 7s, I should increase the digit to a higher number if possible. I notice that I have two 6s and one 5, but no 8s or higher. Given the current bid, I should increase the digit to 8, but since I don't have any 8s, I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (74706315), I have one 7, one 4, one 7, one 0, one 6, one 3, one 1, and one 5. I have duplicates of 7 (two 7s) in my hand. Since I know I have two 7s out of the 32 total digits in play, bidding on 7s gives me some confidence. A conservative starting bid would be 3 7s, which means I'm suggesting there's at least one more 7 among the other players' 24 digits. This is statistically reasonable and builds on my knowledge of my own hand. I could bid on other digits, but 7s gives me the most information advantage.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have four 4s in my hand, so the total count of 4s across all hands is guaranteed to be at least 4. Raising the bid from 3 7s to 4 4s is a valid increase and ensures I will win any challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 85005901. The current bid is 4 4s made by Player 0. There are 4 active players and 32 total digits. The average expected count for any digit is 3.2. I have zero 4s, meaning the other 3 players (24 digits) must have at least four 4s for the current bid to be true. While possible, challenging seems risky without knowing Player 0's hand. I should consider making a higher bid. My hand contains three 0s and two 5s. A bid of '4 5s' (same quantity, higher digit) is possible, requiring 2 more 5s from the other 24 digits. A bid of '5 0s' (higher quantity) is also possible, requiring only 2 more 0s from the other 24 digits. Since I hold three 0s already, '5 0s' is statistically well-supported and leverages my strongest digit. It's a stronger bid than '4 5s' as it increases the quantity, putting more pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 6 0s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have a small chance of contributing to that count. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 1 (two 1s) or 5 (two 5s). However, given the history of challenges, and the fact that 5 0s is already a fairly high bid, increasing the quantity of 0s seems like the most sensible option. Bidding on a higher digit with only two occurrences feels too risky.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '6 0s' made by Player 2. Looking at my hand (74706315), I have one 0. For the bid to be valid, there need to be at least 5 more 0s among the other three players' hands. With 8 digits per player and 4 active players, there are 32 total digits. The probability of having 0s in other players' hands is reasonable, but not guaranteed. However, I don't have strong evidence to challenge. For my bid, I could increase the quantity to 7 0s, but that's risky given I only have one 0. Alternatively, I could keep the quantity at 6 but increase the digit to 1s, 2s, etc. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 3, one 5, one 6, and one 7. Since I have one 7, and I successfully bid on 7s in previous rounds, I'll bid '6 7s' which is higher than '6 0s' while staying at a reasonable quantity.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 7s in my hand. The other 3 players hold 24 hidden digits, with an expected ~2.4 sevens (sd ~1.47) and only ~2.4% chance of at least 6 sevens. The bid of 6 7s is extremely unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have four 4s in my hand. There are 16 unknown digits and the expected number of additional 4s is 1.6, giving about an 81.5% chance of at least one more 4. Therefore bidding 5 4s is a strong, credible opening that others are unlikely to challenge immediately.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 85005901, containing three 0s and two 5s. The current bid is 5 4s made by Player 0. I have zero 4s, meaning the other 16 digits (held by Player 0 and Player 2) must contain at least five 4s for the bid to be true. This seems somewhat high (5/16 required density). Instead of challenging, I can make a higher bid based on my hand. Bidding 6 0s is a valid higher bid. I have three 0s, so this bid requires only three more 0s among the other 16 digits. This is plausible (3/16 required density) and leverages my strongest digit count. This seems safer than challenging the 5 4s bid or making a smaller incremental bid like 5 5s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. I have zero 0s in my hand. Given that there are only 24 total digits remaining across three players, bidding 6 of any digit is fairly risky. I have one 1, one 2, one 5, one 6, one 8 and one 9. Bidding 7 1s would be the lowest quantity increase, but I only have one 1. Bidding 7 2s is also not possible. I have one 5, so bidding 7 5s is also impossible. I have one 6, so bidding 7 6s is also impossible. I have one 8, so bidding 7 8s is impossible. I have one 9, so bidding 7 9s is impossible. Since I have no 0s, and the current bid is 6 0s, it's likely an overbid. Therefore, I should challenge.

Bidding 3 9s would be a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and could be a good bluff, as they haven't shown any interest in 9s.
