Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I can start by making a conservative bid based on my hand. I have the digits: 8, 0, 5, 5, 8, 2, 6, 8. Counting the digits: 8 appears 3 times, 5 appears 2 times, 2 appears once, 0 once, 6 once. To make a safe opening bid, I will choose a total count slightly above my maximum possible known count to avoid an immediate challenge. Bidding 4 8s seems reasonable, as I have three 8s, and with 48 total digits, this is plausible. Alternatively, I could bid 3 8s, but that might be too low. To be safe, I will bid 4 8s, which is slightly higher than my known count, encouraging others to challenge if they think it's unlikely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 8s' and my hand '15646237', I notice I don't have any 8s. However, considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 players, it's possible but not highly likely that there are at least 4 eights among all players. Since my hand doesn't provide strong evidence for or against the current bid, and bidding higher without strong confidence could lead to a risky situation, challenging seems like a viable option. The bid of '4 8s' might be an overestimation, especially if other players also lack significant numbers of 8s in their hands.

Player 0 Reasoning: In this round, no bids have been made yet, and I have a total of two 8s in my hand. Since the game starts with no current bid, I can make the initial bid. Bidding '1 8s' is a safe, conservative opening that reflects my hand and sets a baseline for others to challenge or raise. This bid is the lowest possible, making it a strategic starting point without overcommitting.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. I could bid 2 8s. Since the bid is so low, increasing it seems like the safest move. I will bid 2 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains zero 8s. The current bid is 2 8s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4. The previous round saw a bid of 4 8s succeed with an actual count of 6. However, the current bid is only 2 8s. While I don't have any 8s, it's not unreasonable for two 8s to exist among the remaining 4 players, especially since Player 0 started this round with 1 8s and Player 2 increased it to 2 8s.  Challenging seems risky at this low bid, especially without any information suggesting the other players are unlikely to have 8s. I should make a higher bid. I have three 4s in my hand. Bidding 3 4s is a valid higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Bidding 3 5s is a valid next step and reasonable given the current bid and my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid of 3 5s seems reasonable. I have one 5 in my hand. I can make a higher bid by increasing the quantity to 4, which is the maximum possible quantity for any digit in this game, or by increasing the digit to 6 based on my hand, but the digit 6 is not present in the current bid. However, I don't have a 6 in my hand, so I'll bid on the highest possible quantity for digit 5.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. Given my hand (8,0,5,5,8,2,6,8), I have at most three 5s (two 5s in hand). Since the bid of 4 5s is unlikely to be true, challenging seems appropriate. Challenging now could reveal the actual count and potentially eliminate the previous bidder if they were bluffing.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can make a bid as high as I want. I have no information about the other players' hands, so I'll make a conservative bid based on my own hand. Bidding 2 6s seems reasonable.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I don't have any 6s in my hand. I could challenge, but it's early in the round, and there's a decent chance there are at least two 6s out there. I will increase the bid to 3 7s. I don't have any 7s either, but it's a safe increase.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 79440945. I have one 7 and three 4s. The current bid is 3 7s. With 4 players and 32 digits total, the average count for any digit is 3.2. Player 2's bid of 3 7s is close to the average, and I have one 7. Bidding 4 4s is a strong option based on my hand, increasing the quantity but lowering the digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s, and I must make a higher bid. My hand has one 4 and two 2s and two 3s, but no 5s or higher digits in significant quantity. Bidding 4 5s is a valid increase in digit while keeping the quantity. This is a reasonable bid given the current bid and my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. I should bid on the digit 6, as it is a common digit in my hand. Given that there are only 24 digits remaining and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24, bidding 3 6s seems reasonable.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I don't have any 6s in my hand. I could bid 4 0s, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. Bidding 7 4s seems like a reasonable increase, but it's also risky. However, since there are only 24 digits in total, 6 4s is already a fairly high bid. I could also bid 7 of another digit, or challenge. I will bid 7 4s.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 79440945, containing three 4s. The current bid is 7 4s. With 3 players and 24 total digits, the average count of any digit is 2.4. A bid of 7 4s is significantly higher than average, suggesting Player 2 might have several 4s or is bluffing. Given I hold three 4s, it's plausible there are more among the other two players. However, a bid of 7 is quite high, requiring at least 4 more 4s between the other two players (out of their combined 16 digits). While possible, it's risky. I can bid higher, but increasing the quantity to 8 4s seems too speculative. Increasing the digit to 7 5s or higher is possible, but I only have one 5 and no higher digits. Given the high bid and the uncertainty of the other players' hands, challenging seems like the most prudent move to potentially eliminate Player 2.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have two 4s in my hand, and given that Player 3 made this bid, I should increase both the quantity and the digit to make a higher bid. Bidding 4 5s seems reasonable, as it's a higher quantity and digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. With 16 total digits, the expected number of any digit is around 1.6. A bid of 4 5s is higher than the average expectation. However, Player 5 just made this bid, and they were correct about 4 5s in a previous round with more digits. While I don't have many 5s, I have three 4s. Bidding 5 4s is a valid higher bid and leverages my strong hand in 4s. Challenging 4 5s is risky as Player 5 might actually have several 5s, and they've shown a willingness to bid on them.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand has three 4s. The current bid is 6 4s by Player 5. With 16 total digits, a bid of 6 4s means Player 5 thinks there are at least three 4s in their hand, which is plausible, or they are bluffing. Given I have three 4s, there would need to be at least three more 4s in Player 5's hand for their bid to be true. This is possible but feels high. However, challenging 6 4s when I hold three 4s is risky if Player 5 also has a few. Bidding is safer. I can bid higher than 6 4s. I have three 4s, two 9s, one 7, one 0, and one 5. Bidding 7 4s is a possibility, but it's a significant jump and relies heavily on Player 5 having four or more 4s. Bidding on a different digit with a quantity of 6 or higher is also an option. I have two 9s. Bidding 6 9s or 7 9s seems too high based on my hand alone. Bidding 6 5s is also an option as I have one 5, but it's still a high quantity. Bidding 7 4s is the most direct increase based on the current bid and my hand, acknowledging that Player 5 likely has some 4s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 4s. My hand contains three 4s. With 16 total digits, an average distribution would be 1.6 of each digit. A bid of 8 4s means Player 5 thinks there are at least five 4s in their hand (since I have three). This seems quite high, but not impossible. I could challenge, but I have three 4s, making 8 4s slightly more plausible. Bidding higher requires a quantity of at least 9 or 8 of a higher digit. I don't have enough of any other digit to confidently bid 8 or 9. Given my three 4s, challenging is risky if Player 5 has a significant number of 4s. Bidding 9 4s seems like the most reasonable next step based on my hand and the current bid escalation.

This means Player 5 would need to have at least seven 4s for the bid to be true (10 - 3 = 7). It is highly unlikely that Player 5 has seven 4s out of their 8 digits.
