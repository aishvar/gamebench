Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. With 45 unseen digits and a 10% chance per digit, thereâ€™s over a 99% chance of at least one more 7 among them. Bidding 4 sevens is therefore a strong, credible opener.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 13121822. I have zero 7s. The current bid is 4 7s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, the average count of any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8.  A bid of 4 7s is close to the expected average. However, without any 7s in my hand, and considering the previous player might be bluffing or have a strong hand of 7s, it's difficult to confidently bid higher on 7s or another digit.  Challenging 4 7s seems like a reasonable risk given my lack of 7s, as I have no information to support a higher bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. With 32 unknown digits and an expected 3.2 sevens, the chance of at least one more 7 is about 97%. Bidding 4 sevens is a safe, strong opening.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have the hand 70907975, which contains two 7s. This information supports the likelihood of the bid being correct or even underestimating since I know I have two 7s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Increasing the quantity to 5 and keeping the digit as 7 is a reasonable move, but I can also consider bidding the same quantity with a higher digit. Given that I have two 7s, it's plausible that others might have them as well. Bidding 4 8s seems like a safe and higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand (45081358). The current bid is 4 8s, so bidding 5 8s only requires three more 8s among the 32 unknown digits. The probability of at least three 8s in those 32 is still relatively high (~62%), and raising the quantity on a digit I hold is safer than switching to 4 9s, which I have none of. Therefore I will raise to 5 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. Player 3 claims there are at least 5 8s total. Given that I only see one 8, and there are 32 other digits I can't see, it's plausible there could be 4 more 8s. The previous round revealed that 6 7s existed, and with fewer players now, 5 8s is not an unreasonable bid. I could bid 5 9s, but since I have no 9s in my hand, that would be risky. I'll trust this bid for now and make a conservative higher bid of 6 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I have zero 8s in my hand. With 40 total digits and an expected count of 4 per digit, 6 8s is above average but not necessarily impossible. Challenging now risks elimination if the count is 6 or more. My hand contains three 9s. Bidding 6 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). For 6 9s to be true, the other 4 players (with 32 digits) would need to have three or more 9s among them, which is a plausible scenario given the expected count of 9s in 32 digits is around 3.2. This bid leverages my hand strength and is a reasonable step up.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand and only 32 unknown digits remain. The probability of at least six 9s among them is very low, so I should challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round. My hand is 19294593, which contains three 9s. With 32 total digits among 4 players, the average count for any digit is 3.2. Bidding 5 9s is a strong opening bid that reflects my hand's strength in 9s and is a reasonable quantity above the statistical average, suggesting confidence that other players also hold 9s.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. My hand is 70907975, which contains two 9s and two 7s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have two 9s, the total count of 9s across all players must be at least 8 (2 from me and at least 6 from the other three players). Bidding 6 9s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, bidding 5 0s or higher digit with the same quantity is also valid, but given the presence of 9s in my hand and the previous bid being on 9s, increasing the quantity to 6 9s is a more conservative and informed decision.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand. With 32 cards total the expected number of 9s is about 3.2 (about 2.4 among the other 24 cards), so a claim of 6 9s is extremely unlikely (well under a 10% chance). I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: The game has just started with no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 70907975, which contains two 7s and two 9s. A reasonable starting bid should be based on my hand and the total number of digits remaining (24 across 3 players). Bidding 6 7s seems like a moderate start, considering the total count of 7s could be higher given that there are two other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. With 24 total digits and 3 players, a bid of 6 7s means Player 2 and Player 5 would need to have 5 more 7s between them. While possible, this seems unlikely given the previous rounds showed high counts of 8s and 9s. Also, Player 2 has shown aggressive bidding patterns in previous rounds. Given these factors and that I only have one 7, I should challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: I'm starting the round and have 8 digits: 04168598. With only 2 players left (16 total digits), a conservative opening bid is best. I see one 5 in my hand, and bidding 2 5s is reasonable as it only requires my opponent to have one more 5. This leaves room for future moves while not being too aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. With 16 total digits, a count of 2 for any digit is not highly improbable, so challenging is risky. My hand contains three 9s. Bidding 3 9s is a valid bid that is higher than 2 5s. Since I have three 9s, the total count of 9s is guaranteed to be at least 3, making this bid true regardless of Player 4's hand. This is a safe and strategic move that forces Player 4 to make a higher bid or challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand (04168598). With only 16 total digits between us, and me having just one 9, Player 5 would need to have at least two 9s in their hand to make their bid of '3 9s' valid. While possible, this seems unlikely given that 9s have appeared frequently in previous rounds. Additionally, Player 5 raised from my conservative bid of '2 5s', which might indicate bluffing. The risk/reward ratio favors challenging here.
