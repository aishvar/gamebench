Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid of 3 6s is safe because the total count cannot be less than 3. This bid cannot be successfully challenged, forcing other players to raise the bid further.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s. Bidding 3 7s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 7 and raises the bar for opponents to meet the new bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '3 7s' and my hand '83935162', I notice I have one 7. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 players, each having 8 digits, the bid of '3 7s' seems plausible but not extremely high. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since my hand contains a 7 and an 8, and given that 8 is a higher digit than 7, I can bid on the 8s, which seems like a reasonable move given the information I have.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. For the bid '3 8s' to be true, other players would need to have at least 3 8s among them. While possible, given that I have none and the bid sequence has been steadily increasing with the same quantity, it seems players might be bluffing by just incrementing the digit. The risk of challenging seems lower than making a higher bid without any supporting evidence in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. I have two 8s and one 9 in my hand, but since the highest digit I have is a 9 and I only have one of it, bidding on 9s might not be the safest initial move. Considering the previous round had a successful bid of 3 8s and the total count of 8s was 6, it indicates there are indeed multiple 8s among the players. However, I should start with a conservative bid to avoid being challenged. Since I have two 3s, which is a relatively lower digit, bidding on 3s could be a safer start, considering the distribution of digits might favor lower numbers due to their appearance in more numbers (e.g., 30s, 31s, 32s, etc.). Therefore, a bid of 4 3s seems reasonable, as it's a moderate quantity and a lower digit, making it somewhat safer and harder to challenge without solid evidence.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. There are 5 players with 8 digits each, totaling 40 digits. The expected average count for any digit is 40/10 = 4. So, 4 3s is exactly the average expectation. I have one 3 in my hand (67830485), meaning the bid requires 3 more 3s among the other 32 hidden digits. Challenging is plausible but statistically slightly less likely to succeed (probability of < 4 total 3s is roughly P(0)+P(1)+P(2) needed among 32 digits, which is less than 50%). I need to make a higher bid. Options are 4 4s, 4 5s, ..., or 5 0s, 5 1s, etc. My hand contains two 8s. Bidding 4 8s only requires 2 more 8s among the other 32 digits. This is statistically much more likely (probability > 80%) than the current bid of 4 3s (which requires 3 more 3s). Therefore, bidding 4 8s is a strong, safe move based on my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. It's unlikely there are three more 8s among the other four players' hands, but not impossible. However, I can bid 4 9s, which is a valid higher bid. This is a reasonable move as it doesn't commit me to a very high count, and I haven't seen any indication that 9s are abundant. Alternatively, I could challenge, but the previous challenge failed, so challenging again feels risky without more information. Bidding 4 9s seems like the most strategic move.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. Given the expected distribution of digits across all players and the need to make a strictly higher bid than 4 9s, bidding 5 6s leverages my own holdings and statistical likelihood. The total number of 6s across 40 digits likely exceeds 5 (expected ~6.2), making this bid reasonable.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, and the expected total count of 6s across all players is around 5.2, making the bid plausible. Challenging carries risk if the bid is true. Bidding 5 7s leverages my single 7 in hand and shifts focus to a higher digit, which is a valid and cautious escalation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 7s and considering my hand contains one 7, I must decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Since I only have one 7 and there are 40 digits in total, bidding higher on 7s seems risky. However, I also notice that I have two 6s and a couple of other digits. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40 and we've already had bids for several digits, I should consider the likelihood of higher quantities of other digits. The highest digit I can bid on that is higher than 7 is 8 or 9, but given my hand, I don't have enough information to safely bid on those. Considering the history, Player 1 bid 5 7s, which might be a bit of a stretch given the total number of digits remaining and the distribution we've seen so far. Since I have one 7 and it's hard to estimate the exact distribution without more information, challenging seems like a viable option, especially since the bid of 5 7s might be on the higher side considering the total digits and previous bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make an initial bid. Looking at my hand, 83935162, I have two 3s, two 1s, one 8, one 9, one 6, and one 5, and one 2. Since I have two 3s and considering the distribution of digits might not be even, bidding on a digit I have the most of could be strategic. However, since the goal is to either make a valid higher bid or challenge, and there's no previous bid to challenge, I must start with a bid. Starting with a low quantity and a digit I have could be a good strategy, but since I have to bid higher than 'None', I should consider what would be a reasonable starting point. Given the total number of digits remaining is 32, and there are 4 players, bidding on a digit I have multiple of seems like a good starting point. I have two 3s, which could suggest that there might be more 3s in the other players' hands, but without knowing their hands, starting with a bid that reflects my hand's composition while being mindful of the total possible digits is key.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. There are 4 players with 8 digits each, totaling 32 digits. The expected average count for any digit is 3.2 (32/10). The bid of 2 3s is below this average. I have one '3' in my hand (67830485). This means only one more '3' is needed among the other 3 players (24 digits) for the bid to be correct. Challenging such a low bid is very risky, as it's statistically likely to be true. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two '8's. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable step up. It increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid (2 3s). Having two '8's myself makes needing only one more '8' among the remaining 24 digits plausible.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that there are only 32 digits remaining across 4 players (8 digits each), and the previous rounds saw challenges and eliminations, a bid of 3 8s seems plausible, but not overly aggressive. I could challenge, but I only have one 8, making a challenge risky. Instead, I will increase the quantity while keeping the digit the same. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable next step, as it's a small increase and doesn't commit me too strongly to a high count of 8s.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. With 24 remaining digits across three opponents, the expected number of 8s in their hands is ~2.4. Using a Poisson approximation, there's ~43% probability of >=3 8s in their hands (total 4+8s overall). This means there's ~57% chance the bid is false.

Player 5 Reasoning: It's the start of a new round with only three players and 24 total digits. The previous bid was 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable increase, as it's a higher quantity while still focusing on a digit that exists in my hand. It's not overly aggressive given the limited number of total digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 8s' by Player 5 and considering the total digits remaining is 24, with each player having 8 digits, it seems plausible that there could be at least 4 eights among the players. However, since I have only one 8 in my hand and I don't have any information about the hands of Player 4 and Player 5 except for their bids, I need to make a strategic decision. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24, and since we are already at a bid of 4 8s, increasing the quantity further might be risky without having more information about the other players' hands. Considering my hand has a 6 and a couple of other lower digits, bidding on a higher digit than 8 with the same quantity could be a safer strategy, but since 8 is the highest digit that has been bid on and I don't have enough information to safely increase the quantity or change the digit, challenging seems like a reasonable option. However, given that the last bid was '4 8s', to make a higher bid, I would need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit, which is not possible since 8 is the highest digit and increasing quantity without knowing the distribution of 8s among other players could be risky. Thus, considering the constraints and aiming to make a strategic move, I decide to challenge the current bid as it seems like a safer option than risking a potentially incorrect higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s made by Player 5. My hand (67830485) contains two 8s. This means the minimum actual count of 8s across both hands is already 2. Therefore, challenging the bid of 2 8s would result in a loss for me, as the actual count is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to the bid quantity. I must make a higher bid. The next logical bid is to increase the quantity for the same digit, leveraging the two 8s I hold. Bidding 3 8s is plausible, as it only requires Player 5 to hold at least one 8 out of their 8 digits.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 4 8s would be risky as it relies on Player 4 having at least two 8s. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid. I do not have any 9s in my hand, but it's a reasonable bluff given the limited number of digits remaining and the history of successful bids. Alternatively, challenging seems too risky as Player 4 has already shown a willingness to bid aggressively on 8s, and they could easily have enough to win a challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s, made by Player 5. I have zero 9s in my hand (67830485). For the bid to be true, Player 5 must have at least three 9s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is statistically low (around 3.8%). Player 5 previously bid 2 8s, I raised to 3 8s (based on my two 8s), and Player 5 then switched to 3 9s instead of bidding 4 8s or challenging my 3 8s bid. This switch suggests they might not be confident about the count of 8s and could be bluffing about the 9s. Given I hold no 9s, the bid of 3 9s is highly suspect. Challenging is the most logical action.
