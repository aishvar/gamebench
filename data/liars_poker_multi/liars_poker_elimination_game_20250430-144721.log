Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 50345606, which contains two 0s, one 3, two 4s, one 5, and two 6s. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the digits I see in my hand. I have a total of 8 digits, and the most frequent digit in my hand is 6 with two occurrences. Considering there are 6 players, I can estimate that there might be more 6s in other hands. However, I should start with a conservative bid. Bidding 8 0s or 8 6s seems too high for a first bid since it assumes all other players have at least one of the same digit I have the most. A more reasonable starting point would be to bid on a digit I have, with a quantity that is somewhat conservative but still reflects a possible total count across all players. Bidding 10 4s or 10 6s could be reasonable as it slightly overestimates my count and assumes others might have a similar digit. I choose to bid 10 6s as it is a digit I have and seems like a plausible total count across 6 players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits: 8, 0, 2, 0, 2, 9, 1, 4. Counting the number of 6s across all players is uncertain, but I have no 6s in my hand, so my contribution is zero. The current bid is 10 6s, which seems quite high given the total possible digits. Challenging might be reasonable if I believe the total number of 6s is less than 10, but since I have no 6s, the total is unlikely to reach 10. Bidding higher on 6s is impossible because I have zero 6s. Therefore, the best move is to challenge the previous bid, questioning its validity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The previous bid of 10 6s was challenged and found to be false, with only 4 sixes in total. Now, it's my turn to bid. I hold two 0s, two 2s, one 1, and one 4, totaling 6 digits. Given that the maximum total is 40 and previous bid was 10 6s, I should bid just above that to stay safe. Bidding 11 0s is feasible since I have two zeros, but I can't guarantee more than that. Bidding 10 0s is too close to my actual count, so I will bid 11 0s, which is slightly higher than my actual zeros, aiming to challenge the previous bid's validity and push the game forward.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 11 0s. With 40 total digits across 5 players, the average number of 0s would be 4 (40/10). Bidding 11 0s is significantly higher than the expected average, making it highly unlikely. Challenging this bid is reasonable as it probably contains a bluff.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains two 8s. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid that reflects my hand's composition. Bidding 3 8s is a logical choice, as it increases the quantity from my two 8s, assuming others may have at least one more 8. This bid is conservative yet follows the rules of increasing quantity or digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. With 32 total digits among 4 players, 3 8s is a plausible bid (close to the expected average of 3.2). Challenging carries risk if the bid is true. My hand contains two 9s. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is highly likely to be true, as it only requires one additional 9 from the remaining 24 digits across the other three players. Making a safe bid based on my hand is a better strategic move than challenging a plausible bid at this stage.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. I could bid 4 of any digit, or 3 of a digit higher than 9, which is impossible. I can bid 4 0s. This is safe and progresses the game.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None' since this is a new round. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 1 6 seems like a safe starting bid, as it's unlikely that all other players have zero 6s. This bid is also the minimum valid bid in this situation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s made by Player 2. My hand is 18990756, which contains two 9s. There are 3 players and 24 total digits remaining. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity from 2 to 3. I have two 9s in my hand, so I only need one more 9 from the remaining 16 digits held by other players for the bid to be true. The probability of at least one 9 appearing in 16 random digits is high (approx 81.5%). This makes 3 9s a strong and likely true bid based on my hand strength. Challenging 2 7s is risky as I have one 7 and the probability of the other players having at least one more 7 is high.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. With only 24 total digits remaining and three players, it's unlikely that there are three 9s in total. Challenging seems like a good move. If I lose, I will be eliminated, but the risk is worth it given the low probability of the current bid being true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round with 2 players and 16 total digits. My hand is 18990756, containing two 9s. The average count for any digit across 16 digits is 1.6. Bidding 3 9s is a reasonable starting bid, based on my two 9s and the expectation that the other player might have at least one 9 (which has a probability of about 57% with 8 digits). This is a slightly aggressive but common first bid strategy when you have a pair of a digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have two 9s in my hand, and Player 3's hand has 8 digits. The total number of 9s could be as low as 2 (if Player 3 has none) or higher. Since the bid requires at least 3 9s, there's a significant chance the actual count is 2, making the bid false. Challenging now could eliminate Player 3 if the count is indeed insufficient.
