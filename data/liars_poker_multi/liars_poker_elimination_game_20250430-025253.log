Player 1 Reasoning: I have four 9s in my hand (99976892). The current bid is 2 9s, so bidding 3 9s increases the quantity while staying within the same digit. This leverages my known high count of 9s and follows the rule that a higher quantity is a valid bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains two 0s and no 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, which I cannot verify. Bidding 4 0s is a safer move since I have two 0s, and it's plausible others have two more. Challenging risks elimination if the bid is valid, but with no 9s in my hand, the total count could be low. Bidding a higher quantity with a common digit (0) balances risk and probability.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 2's bid of '4 0s' or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (76911535), I don't have any 0s. With 6 players having 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. Player 2 is claiming there are at least 4 zeros among all players. Since I have 0 zeros in my hand, the other 5 players would need to have at least 4 zeros between them, which is quite possible (less than 1 zero per player on average). So challenging seems risky. For my bid, I could bid '5 0s', but since I don't have any 0s to contribute, that's risky. I could also switch to a different digit with the same quantity (e.g., '4 1s', '4 2s', etc.) or increase both quantity and digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s and one 5, so bidding '4 1s' or '4 5s' would be reasonable. I'll go with '4 5s' since it's a higher digit than 1.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 83327790, which contains no 5s. The current bid is 4 5s by Player 3. Since I have zero 5s, I need to consider if 4 5s across all 48 digits is plausible. With 6 players and 8 digits each, it's possible but on the lower side of likelihood. However, challenging now might be risky as 4 5s is not an extreme bid. I can make a higher bid instead. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 5 7s could be a reasonable escalation, increasing both the quantity and the digit. This keeps me in the game while testing the other players' confidence.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 91342044. I have two 4s, one 9, one 1, one 3, one 2, and one 0. The current bid is 5 7s.  Since I have no 7s, bidding on 7s is risky. I have two 4s, and the previous bid was 4 5s. Bidding 5 4s is a valid higher bid and seems plausible given my hand and the number of players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 2/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 91342044. I have zero 7s. The current bid is 5 7s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average per digit is 4.8. A bid of 5 7s is slightly above average, but not extremely high. However, since I have no 7s, it's less likely that the other players collectively have 5 or more 7s. Given my lack of 7s and the relatively high bid for that digit, challenging seems like a reasonable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: As the first bidder in this round with no current bid to beat, I can start with a conservative bid. My hand is 83327790, which gives me two 7s, two 3s, and one each of 8, 2, 9, and 0. Since I have two 7s, bidding on 7s seems reasonable. With 5 players and 40 total digits, an average of 4 of each digit is expected across all hands. Bidding 3 7s is a safe starting point, as I already contribute 2 to the count, and it's likely at least one more 7 exists among the other 32 digits.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 4 0s is a valid higher bid, as it increases the quantity and the digit is irrelevant when the quantity increases.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains four 9s, which allows me to bid 4 9s. This is a valid higher bid than the current 4 0s because the quantity remains the same (4) but the digit (9) is higher than 0. This leverages my known cards while adhering to the rules.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s, so challenging is risky as the expected count of 9s is 4 (40 digits * 10% = 4). Instead, I bid 5 0s, leveraging my two 0s and the higher likelihood of zeros in others' hands. This increases the quantity while targeting a more probable digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (76911535), I don't have any 0s. Player 2 has bid 5 0s, which means they believe there are at least 5 zeros among all players. Since I have no 0s, all 5 would need to come from the other 4 players. This is possible but not guaranteed. I could challenge, but it's a risky move this early in the game. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 1s and one 5 in my hand. I could bid 5 1s (same quantity, higher digit) or 5 5s (same quantity, even higher digit). Since I have only one 5, bidding on 5s is riskier. I'll go with 5 1s, which I believe is a safer bid given what I know about my hand.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:1 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s by Player 3. In my hand, I have no 1s, which means I contribute nothing to the count for this digit. With 40 total digits across 5 players, an average of 4 ones per digit is expected if distributed evenly. A bid of 5 1s is slightly above average but still plausible. However, since I have no 1s, it’s possible the distribution is skewed, and the actual count might be lower. I could challenge, but the risk is high as 5 1s is not an extreme bid. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. My hand has two 3s, two 7s, and other digits. Bidding on 7s could work since I previously bid 3 7s and now can increase it to 6 7s, which is higher than 5 1s in quantity. This bid is plausible given my contribution of two 7s, and it keeps the game moving while testing others' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains four 9s. The current bid is 7 7s. Bidding 7 9s is a valid higher bid since it maintains the same quantity (7) but increases the digit to 9, which is higher than 7. This leverages my hand's strength in 9s while adhering to the rules for increasing bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. My hand contains no 9s, and the expected number of 9s in 32 digits (other players) is 3.2. Bidding 7 9s is statistically unlikely. Challenging the bid is a strategic move to test its validity, as the required count exceeds the average distribution. If the bid is false, I win; if true, I lose, but the risk is justified given the improbability.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 4 9s by Player 1. With 4 players having 8 digits each (32 total), there could reasonably be 4 or more 9s in total. Looking at my hand, I notice I have two 5s and one each of 1, 3, 6, 7, 9. I could bid 5 0s, 5 1s, 5 2s, 5 3s, 5 4s, 5 5s, 5 6s, 5 7s, 5 8s, or 5 9s. I also have the option to challenge. Since I have one 9, that means the other players would need to have at least 3 more 9s between them for the current bid to be valid. This is quite possible. I'll bid 5 5s since I have two 5s in my hand, making it more likely there are at least 5 5s total.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 83327790, which contains two 7s and no 5s. The current bid is 5 5s by Player 3. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 5 5s is plausible, as it represents about 16% of the total digits, which is reasonable for a single digit. I don't have any 5s myself, but it's still within the realm of possibility that others have them. Instead of challenging, I'll make a higher bid. Since I have two 7s, bidding on 7s feels safer. I can bid 6 7s, which is a higher quantity than the current bid of 5 5s. This bid accounts for my two 7s and assumes at least four more among the other 24 digits, which is feasible given past bidding patterns on 7s (e.g., my previous bid of 6 7s and Player 0's bid of 7 7s in the last round). Therefore, I’ll bid 6 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. I have one 9 in my hand (76911535). The current bid is 7 9s made by Player 1. With 4 players having 8 digits each, there are 32 total digits in play. For there to be 7 9s, the other players would need to have 6 more 9s among them, which means on average 2 9s per player. This is possible but getting to be a high count. Player 1 has bid 9s twice now (4 9s and 7 9s), which suggests they might have several 9s in their hand. Looking at my options: I could bid 8 9s, but that's risky since I only have 1. I could bid 7 0s, but I have no 0s in my hand. I could bid 8 of a lower digit, but that's also risky without knowing the distribution. Given that I have two 5s in my hand, and I previously bid on 5s, I think bidding 8 5s is my safest option. While still risky, it's based on what I know I have.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 5s by Player 3. In my hand, I have no 5s, which means I must rely on the other players to have a significant number of 5s for the bid to hold. With 32 total digits across 4 players, 8 5s means that 25% of all digits would need to be 5s, which seems high but not impossible. Looking at the bidding history, Player 3 has been increasing bids on 5s (from 4 5s to 5 5s to now 8 5s), which might indicate confidence in 5s, but it could also be a bluff. I have strong digits in my hand like three 7s and two 3s, so I could bid higher on 7s (e.g., 8 7s) or switch to another digit. However, since the bid of 8 5s is a significant jump from previous bids and I have no 5s myself, I’m inclined to challenge as it feels overly aggressive. The risk of challenging is elimination if wrong, but bidding higher (like 9 5s or 8 6s) feels unsafe without support in my hand for 5s or 6s. I’ll take the risk and challenge.

My hand is 83327790, which gives me two 7s. Bidding on 7s seems reasonable as I know at least two exist.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 83327790, which contains two 7s, one 9, and no 0s. The current bid is 4 9s by Player 1. I only have one 9, so across 24 total digits, I need to assess if 4 9s is plausible. Given that there are 3 players with 8 digits each, it's possible but not highly likely that the other players have enough 9s to make up the difference. However, looking at the bidding history, Player 1 has bid on 9s multiple times, including higher bids like 7 9s, which turned out to be correct in a previous round. This suggests they might have a strong hand in 9s. I could bid higher, such as 5 0s or 5 9s, but since I have no 0s and only one 9, I’m not confident in those bids. Given the uncertainty and the moderate bid of 4 9s, I think it’s safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I’ll bid 5 9s, increasing the quantity, as it’s a reasonable escalation and aligns with Player 1’s bidding pattern on 9s.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:3 - google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a low but reasonable bid. I have two 0s in my hand, so bidding 3 0s seems like a safe starting point.

Player 0 bids: 3 0s

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:1 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 83327790, which contains one 0. The current bid by Player 0 is 3 0s across the total 16 digits remaining (8 mine, 8 theirs). Since I only have one 0, Player 0 must have at least two 0s for the bid to hold, which is plausible. However, I can make a higher bid to keep the game going and test their confidence. I have two 7s in my hand, so bidding 4 7s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid of 3 0s. This bid is within a believable range given the total digits, and it leverages my own hand strength.

Player 4 bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:3 - google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 5 7s seems like a reasonable increase, and it's not too risky given I have one 7 already.

Player 0 bids: 5 7s

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:1 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 83327790, which contains two 7s. The current bid by Player 0 is 5 7s, meaning they are claiming there are at least five 7s across both our hands (16 total digits). Since I only have two 7s, Player 0 must have at least three 7s in their hand for the bid to hold, which is possible but not highly likely given that they bid only 3 0s initially and then jumped to 5 7s after my bid of 4 7s. However, with only two players left, bidding higher might be riskier as the total digits are fewer. I could bid higher, like 6 7s, but that would require me to have confidence in even more 7s existing, which I doubt. Alternatively, challenging now might be a better move since the likelihood of Player 0 having three or more 7s seems moderate, and if I lose the challenge, the game ends anyway. Given the bidding history, Player 0's jump from 3 0s to 5 7s after my 4 7s might indicate bluffing. I’ll take the risk and challenge.
