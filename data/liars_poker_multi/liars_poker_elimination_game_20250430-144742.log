Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and the first to bid. My hand is 69117994, containing two 1s and three 9s. There are 6 players and 48 total digits. The expected average count for any digit is 4.8 (48 / 10). My strongest suit is 9s (I have 3). The total expected number of 9s across all hands is approximately 7 (3 in my hand + 4 expected in the other 40 digits). As the first bidder, a safe but informative bid is best. Bidding '5 9s' leverages my strong hand in 9s, is slightly above the statistical average, and is plausible given the expected total count of 7. This seems like a solid opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 0's bid of 5 9s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (84522633), I don't have any 9s. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, so 48 total digits. For Player 0's bid to be valid, there need to be at least 5 nines among all players. Since I have 0 nines, the other 5 players would need to have at least 5 nines between them, which is certainly possible. Without more information about typical digit distributions or previous betting patterns, I can't confidently challenge. I'll make a higher bid instead. I have two 2s and two 3s in my hand, which gives me some confidence in bidding on these digits. I'll bid 6 2s, increasing the quantity.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand, and the current bid is 6 2s. Since I have a 2, I can make a reasonable bid by increasing the quantity or digit. I'll go with increasing the quantity to 7, as it's a safe choice.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand. With 6 active players and 8 digits each (48 total), the bid of 7 2s means there need to be 6 more 2s among other players' hands. While possible, this seems unlikely given that 2s aren't typically clustered. Based on probability and having only one 2 myself, I should challenge rather than make a higher bid which would require even more 2s to exist.

Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand, I have two 7s, which is a good starting point. Since I'm starting the round and have actual information about 7s, making a conservative bid of 4 7s seems reasonable. With 5 players having 8 digits each (40 total), and knowing I have 2 sevens, it's likely there are at least 2 more 7s among the other 32 digits. This bid leaves room for others to bid higher while being based on actual knowledge from my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I'm starting this round and have a strong hand with two 7s. Given that I successfully bid 4 7s last round (which was accurate), and now there are fewer total digits in play (32 vs 40), starting with a conservative bid of 3 7s seems strategic. This leaves room for others to bid higher while being a safe opening based on my known cards.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand. The expected number of 7s in the remaining 24 digits (from other players) is approximately 2.4, which is less than the bid of 3. Statistically, the probability of there being at least 3 7s is around 43.65%, making it more likely the bid is false. Challenging this bid has a higher chance of success.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand, which has worked well for me in previous rounds. Since this is the first bid of the round and I've successfully bid on 7s before, starting with 3 7s is a reasonable opening bid. It's conservative enough given I already know about two 7s, and there's room for more among the other 16 digits held by other players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s made by Player 3. There are 24 total digits among the 3 remaining players. I hold one 7 (in 69117994). For the bid to be true, there need to be at least 2 more 7s among the other 16 digits held by Player 1 and Player 3. The expected number of 7s in those 16 digits is 1.6 (16 * 1/10), so 2 more is plausible, making a challenge risky, especially given Player 3's history of successful bids on 7s. My hand contains three 9s, which is a very strong holding for a single digit (expected count across all 24 digits is 2.4). Bidding higher is preferable to challenging. Possible higher bids are 3 8s, 3 9s, 4 0s, etc. Bidding 3 8s is weak as I have no 8s. Bidding 3 9s is safe as I hold three 9s, but it's a minimal increase. Bidding 4 9s is a strong option: it increases the quantity, leverages my three 9s, and is statistically very likely to be true (only need 1 more 9 from the remaining 16 digits, where the expected number is 1.6). This puts significant pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (84522633), I have zero 9s. Player 0 has bid 4 9s, meaning they're claiming there are at least 4 nines among all 24 digits in play. Since I have none, all 4 would need to be split between Player 0 and Player 3. This is possible but somewhat unlikely. With 8 digits per player, if the 9s were evenly distributed, each player would have about 2.4 of each digit on average. For there to be 4 or more 9s, Player 0 and Player 3 would need to have an above-average number of 9s. I could challenge, but it's risky as 4 9s is within the realm of possibility. Alternatively, I could bid 5 0s, 5 1s, or 5 2s (I have two 2s in my hand). Since I have two 3s, bidding 5 3s seems reasonable as I only need 3 more among the other players' 16 digits. This is a safer move than challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand of 23097677, I only have zero 3s. With 3 players having 8 digits each (24 total), and Player 1 claiming there are 5 3s total, this means other players would need to have at least 5 3s between them (16 digits total). The probability of having 5 3s in 16 random digits is quite low, and given I have zero 3s, this makes the claim even more unlikely. Previous rounds have shown I've been successful with challenges, and this bid seems particularly suspicious.

Player 3 Reasoning: I'm starting this round with 16 total digits between two players. In my hand (23097677), I have: two 7s, one each of 2,3,0,9,6. Looking at my previous rounds, I've successfully bid on 7s multiple times, and I know I have two of them. Starting with a conservative bid of 3 7s seems reasonable since I already have 2 and only need one more from the other 8 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 69117994. I have one 7 and three 9s. The current bid is 3 7s by Player 3. There are 16 total digits. I have one 7, so the bid is true if Player 3 has two or more 7s. Player 3 has won previous challenges bidding on 7s (4 7s when total was 40, 3 7s when total was 32, both times actual count was 4), suggesting they might hold multiple 7s. Challenging 3 7s seems risky, as Player 3 likely has at least two 7s, making the total count 3 or more. I should make a higher bid. A bid must be higher quantity or same quantity with a higher digit. Possible bids are 3 8s, 3 9s, 4 0s, etc. I have three 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid only requires zero 9s from Player 3's hand to be true, making it very likely accurate and safe for me if challenged. It forces Player 3 to either challenge a very plausible bid or increase the quantity to 4.

Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand of 23097677, I have zero 9s. Since there are only 16 total digits in play (8 per player), and Player 0 claims there are 3 9s total, this means they would need to have at least 3 9s in their hand since I have none. While possible, having 3 of the same digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively unlikely. Given that I know for certain there are zero 9s in my half of the digits, and the opponent would need to have exactly 3 9s for their bid to be true, challenging seems like the optimal play.
