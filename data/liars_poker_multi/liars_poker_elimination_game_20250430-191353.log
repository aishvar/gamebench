Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have my hand of 8 digits: 06505081. Since this is the first bid and I can see two 5s in my hand, making a conservative opening bid of '3 5s' is reasonable. With 6 players having 8 digits each (48 total), and knowing I have 2 of them, it's very likely there are at least 1-2 more 5s among other players.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 0. I have one 5 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 5, increasing the quantity seems risky without more information. However, I can increase the digit. Bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it's a higher digit and I have a 6 in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits in play. The current bid is 3 6s, which is not unreasonable at this stage. Since I have only one 6, it's possible that there are at least three 6s total, so challenging now is risky. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and raise the digit. I have two 7s and two 9s, so I can safely bid 3 7s, which is a higher digit at the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I hold two 8s in my hand, so I only need one more among the 40 unknown digits to meet a bid of 3 8s. The probability of at least one 8 among 40 unknowns is very high, and 3 8s is the minimal valid raise (same quantity, higher digit).

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s, and I have the digits 8, 9, 0, 5, 2, 1, 4, 7. Counting my 8s, I have one 8. The total remaining digits are 48, and with 4 players, the maximum total 8s possible is 4. Since the bid is 3 8s, and I only have one 8, challenging seems reasonable if I believe the total count is less than 3. However, considering others might have more 8s, and the bid is not extremely high, I will increase the bid to be safer. I can bid 4 8s, which is within the maximum possible, and is a strict increase over 3 8s. This move puts pressure on the previous bidder without overcommitting.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which means there would need to be at least three more 8s among the other five players (total of 40 digits). Given that the previous bids have been conservative (3 of various digits), it's possible but not certain. However, challenging now could be risky since 4 8s is still within reasonable bounds. A safer move would be to bid 4 9s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total), having 4 9s is possible but risky. Looking at my hand (06505081), I see two 5s, one 6, zero 7s, one 8, and zero 9s. The bid history shows steady progression, but 4 9s feels high given I see none. Since I know for certain there are 0 nines in my 8 digits, that means the other 5 players would need to have 4 nines among their 40 digits. While possible, this seems unlikely enough to warrant a challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have four 3s in my hand, which is a strong starting point. Since the current bid is None and I'm starting the round, I can set a reasonable bid based on my hand. Bidding 4 3s is a strong opening move, leveraging my high count of 3s and setting a high bar for the next players.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s made by Player 5. I have 8 secret digits: 66704271. I see that I have one 3 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40 and there are 40 total digits remaining, bidding a high quantity is risky without more information. However, I can see that bidding a higher digit with a low quantity is an option. For example, bidding 4 6s would be higher than 4 3s because the digit is higher. Given that I have two 6s, I can reasonably bid on 6s.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 92074397, which contains two 9s, two 7s, one 0, one 4, one 3, and one 2, but no 6s. The current bid is 4 6s. Statistically, with 40 digits among 5 players, each digit is expected to appear about 4 times. I have zero 6s, so it's possible that the other players collectively have 4 or more 6s, but it's not certain. However, since the bid is not outrageous and it's early in the round, I can safely make a minimal higher bid. The next valid bid is 4 7s, which aligns with my hand as I have two 7s. This keeps me in the game without overcommitting.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Among the 32 unknown digits, we’d expect about 3.2 more 8s, so it’s likely there are at least two others to reach four. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid and more plausible than challenging the current 4 7s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s, and I hold 8, 9, and 4 in my hand. Since I have at least one 8, the total count of 8s could be as high as 8 (if all other players have no 8s). Bidding 4 8s is already on the edge, but I can confidently bid higher with 4 9s, given I have a 9. This increases the bid's quantity without risking an immediate challenge, and I hold a 9, making 4 9s plausible. Therefore, I will bid 4 9s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have four 3s in my hand, which is already the current bid quantity for 3s. The current bid is 4 9s, which is a high digit. Given that I have no 9s in my hand and the bid is already at 4, it's unlikely that there are four 9s across all players. Therefore, challenging seems like the best option.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current round has no bids yet, so I can start with a bid. My hand contains the digits 8, 9, 0, 5, 2, 1, 4, 7. I see I have two 8s and one 9, so I can confidently bid at least 2 8s or 1 9. Since no previous bid exists, I should start with a conservative bid to establish a baseline. Bidding 2 8s seems reasonable, as I know I have at least two eights in my hand, and it's a safe starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s made by Player 4. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that there are 3 other players and each has 8 digits, the maximum possible 8s in other players' hands is 24. With my 8, the total possible 8s is 25. A bid of 2 8s seems very low and likely, but I should consider if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since my goal is to either make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should look at my hand and see if I can make a higher bid. I have one 8 and other digits that could potentially be used to make a higher bid. However, challenging seems risky if the count is indeed higher than 2. I will make a higher bid to be conservative.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. My hand contains two 7s (digits: 92074397). With 32 digits in play, it is plausible that there is at least one more 7 among the other 24 digits. Rather than challenging, I can confidently raise the bid to 3 9s, as I also hold two 9s, and the recent history shows that bids of 4 9s have succeeded with 40 and 48 digits in play. With only 32 digits, a bid of 3 9s is a safe, incremental increase.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one 9 but two 8s in my hand. To outbid 3 9s I must increase the quantity to 4. With two 8s and an expected 2.4 8s among the 24 unknown cards, bidding 4 8s has over a 70% chance of being true, making it the strongest bid given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current highest bid is 4 8s. My hand contains one 8, so the maximum total count of 8s I could support is 1, which is far below the bid of 4. Challenging the bid of 4 8s is a good move because it's highly unlikely that there are at least 4 eights across all hands, given my own hand and the total remaining digits. Bidding higher isn't possible since I don't have enough eights to support a higher bid. Therefore, I will challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 8, 9, 0, 5, 2, 1, 4, 7. I know there are 24 total digits remaining and the previous bids have been relatively high, especially 4 9s and 4 8s. Since no bid has been made yet in this round, I can start with a conservative bid. Given my hand, I have one 8 and one 9, so I can reasonably bid at least 2 8s or 2 9s. Bidding 2 8s or 2 9s seems safe and within my hand's capacity, and it raises the bid from the starting point.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s made by Player 4. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that there are only 24 digits in total and three players, it's possible that the bid could be valid, especially if Player 4 and Player 2 also have 8s. However, I don't have enough information to be certain. I should bid higher to test the validity or challenge if I think it's unlikely. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I will first analyze my hand and the current bid. My hand contains one 8, and I can see if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more reasonable.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 92074397, which contains two 9s and two 7s, but zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s. Since I have none, for the bid to be valid, the other two players would need to have at least three 8s between them, which is unlikely given only 16 digits remain between them. Additionally, the previous rounds show that bids on 8s have been challenged and lost before. The probability of 3 8s existing among the remaining hands is low, so challenging is the best move.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. Given my hand (8, 9, 0, 5, 2, 1, 4, 7), I have one 9. The total number of 9s across both hands cannot exceed 2, since I only have one 9 and the other player has at most 8 digits. Bidding 3 9s would be impossible; challenging seems more reasonable to test the opponent's bid. Since the opponent bid 2 9s, and I believe the actual count is at most 1, challenging is the best move.
