Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits. The expected average quantity for any digit is 48 / 10 = 4.8. My hand is 82450198, and I have two 8s, which is the most frequent digit in my hand. A common opening strategy is to bid around the expected value, often using a digit you hold multiple of. Bidding '5 8s' is slightly above the statistical average but is supported by my holding two 8s, making it a reasonable and informative opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have one 8 in my hand, but bidding 5 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This leverages the possibility that other players might have 9s, and it avoids directly challenging the bid without sufficient evidence.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. With 40 unseen digits, I’d expect about 4 more 2s and there’s roughly a 78% chance of at least 3 more. Bidding 6 2s is a plausible raise. Challenging 5 9s only has about a 40% chance of success and risks my elimination.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. I have the digits 0, 9, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4, 0 in my hand. Counting the number of 2s, I see two 2s. The total number of 2s across all hands is unlikely to be more than 6, given my hand and the maximum of 8 digits per player. Bidding 7 2s would be a stretch, and increasing the digit seems safer. Since I only have 2 twos, increasing the quantity to 7 or 8 is unlikely. The safest move is to challenge, as the previous bid of 6 2s is probably too high.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand, and on average there are about 3.2 more 2s among the other 32 digits. Bidding 6 2s is plausible based on expected counts and establishes a strong opening.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The previous challenge revealed 9 total 2s, confirming the current bid of 6 2s is safe. My hand has no 2s, but the total count is known to be higher than the bid. Bidding 7 2s increases the quantity while staying within the proven total (9). This is a low-risk move as the bid remains true, and it pressures others to either raise further or challenge, which could backfire if they miscalculate.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 2s by Player 4. I have no 2s in my hand, so I should bid a higher digit or same digit with higher quantity. I have a 4 in my hand, so I can bid 7 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 4s. There are 5 players with 8 digits each, totaling 40 digits. The expected number of any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. I have one 4 in my hand (82450198). This means the remaining 32 digits held by the other 4 players must contain at least six 4s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 4s among the other 32 digits is 3.2. Therefore, the total expected number of 4s is 1 (mine) + 3.2 = 4.2. A bid of 7 is significantly higher than the expected value of 4.2, suggesting it's unlikely to be accurate. Player 5 also switched digits from the previous bid (7 2s) while keeping the quantity high, which could indicate uncertainty or a bluff. Challenging seems statistically favorable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am Player 0 and it's my turn to make the first bid of the round. There are 4 active players and 32 total digits. The expected average count for any digit is 3.2. My hand is 82450198, which contains two 8s. This is above the average expectation for a single hand. Based on my two 8s, bidding on 8s seems like a strong opening. A bid of 3 8s would be very safe, as it's below the expected average. A bid of 4 8s is slightly more assertive but still plausible, assuming at least two more 8s exist among the other 24 digits held by the other players (which aligns reasonably with the expected average). I will start with 4 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. Previous bids showed that 2s are common (e.g., 6 2s was a bid with actual count 9). Bidding 5 2s increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid than 4 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. The current bid of 5 2s requires only two more 2s among the 24 unknown digits, which is about a 71% chance—so challenging is unwise (~29% win rate). The safest raise is to 6 2s: I need three more 2s from unknown, which has about a 44% chance—higher than any other valid bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have no 2s in my hand, and the current bid is 6 2s. With 32 total digits and only 3 players remaining (including me), the likelihood of there being 6 2s is low. Given the previous challenge success against 7 4s, this bid may be a bluff. Challenging could eliminate Player 2 if the count is insufficient.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. With 16 unknown cards, the expected number of additional 2s is about 1.6, and the probability of at least one more 2 is over 80%. Opening with 4 2s is a modest, safe bid that leverages my strong holding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s made by Player 2. I have one '2' in my hand (82450198). For the bid to be true, the other two players (16 digits combined) must have at least three '2's. Given the total of 24 digits, 4 is a relatively low and plausible quantity. Player 2 has also successfully bid on 2s in previous rounds, suggesting they might hold some or are confident in them. Challenging seems risky. I have two '8's in my hand. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This leverages my hand's strength, requiring only two more '8's among the other 16 unknown digits, which is statistically reasonable.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, so increasing the quantity to 5 2s is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 2s and raises the stakes without relying on the current digit's likelihood.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold three 2s and there are 16 unknown digits. The probability of at least two more 2s among them is only about 48.6%, so it’s slightly more likely the bid of 5 2s is false. Any raise would be even less probable. I should challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains three 2s. Since the current bid is None, I need to make the first bid. Bidding 4 2s is a logical choice as it leverages the three 2s I hold and adds one more to account for potential 2s in Player 0's hand. This bid is both quantitatively and digit-wise reasonable given the game state.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s made by Player 1. I have one '2' in my hand (82450198). For the bid to be true, Player 1 must have at least three '2's in their 8-digit hand. While possible, needing 3 out of 8 digits to be the same specific digit is somewhat unlikely (expected value is 0.8). Challenging is an option. However, I have two '8's. Bidding '4 8s' is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires Player 1 to have at least two '8's, which seems more plausible than them having three '2's. Bidding '4 8s' leverages my hand strength and puts the pressure back on Player 1 without taking the immediate risk of a challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand (32227870). With 16 total digits remaining, the probability that Player 0 has at least 3 more 8s to reach 4 is uncertain. Since I have limited information and the bid requires a high likelihood of success, challenging the bid is a strategic move to test its validity.
