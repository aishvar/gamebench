Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since I'm the first to bid and there's no current bid to reference, I need to make a strategic opening bid. Looking at my hand (33800692), I have two 3s, one 8, one 0, one 6, one 9, and one 2. The most frequent digit in my hand is 3, which appears twice. Given that there are 6 players with 8 digits each (48 total digits), and assuming a somewhat even distribution, I might expect around 4-5 of each digit in total. I'll start with a conservative bid based on my strongest digit, which is 3s. I have 2 in my hand, so I'll bid 4 3s, which is reasonable but not too aggressive for an opening bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding in this new round. Looking at my hand (33800692), I have two 3s, one 8, one 0, one 6, one 9, and one 2. Since I have two 3s in my hand, and 3s were common in the previous round (there were 7 total), I'll start with a moderate bid on 3s. With 5 players having 8 digits each (40 total digits), and me having 2 of them, it's reasonable to estimate there might be around 8-10 3s total. I'll start conservatively with a bid of 6 3s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. I have the digits 73795408, which includes one 3. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have one 3, it's plausible that the total count of 3s is at least 6 across all players. However, increasing the quantity might be risky. I can bid 6 4s, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit, which is a safer move given my hand doesn't strongly support a higher count of 3s or any other specific digit in large quantities.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. On average, there should be 40/10 = 4 of each digit. A bid of 6 is slightly above average. I have two 4s in my hand (90441932). This means for the bid of 6 4s to be true, there must be at least 4 more 4s among the other 4 players (32 digits). This is plausible (4 needed vs 3.2 expected on average in those 32 digits). Challenging seems risky because the bid isn't excessively high, and my own hand supports it somewhat. I need to make a higher bid. I could bid 7 4s, but that requires 5 more 4s from the other 32 digits, which feels like a bigger jump. Alternatively, I can keep the quantity at 6 and bid a higher digit. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 6 9s is a valid higher bid. This requires 4 more 9s from the other 32 digits, which has similar plausibility to the current 6 4s bid being true. Bidding 6 9s leverages my hand and passes the decision without significantly increasing the claimed quantity.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have the hand 15381037, which contains no 9s. The current bid is 6 9s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in play. For there to be at least 6 9s, the average per player would need to be at least slightly more than one 9 per hand. Since I have zero 9s, and the probability of the other four players collectively having 6 or more 9s is low, this bid seems unlikely to be valid. Therefore, I should challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: As the first bidder this round, I want to make a reasonable opening bid based on my hand. My hand is 15381037, which contains two 3s, one 1, one 5, one 8, one 0, one 7, and one more 3, so actually three 3s in total. Since there are 4 players with 8 digits each, any digit could appear up to 32 times, but on average each digit might appear about 3 times in each hand. The previous rounds show that opening bids of 4 3s and 6 3s were made, and both were not immediately challenged. To open conservatively and credibly, I will bid 4 3s, as I hold three myself, making it likely there are at least four in total.

Player 4 Reasoning: I am the first to bid this round. My hand is 15381037, which contains two 3s and one of each of the other digits except 2, 4, 6, and 9. Since there are 24 digits in play, a safe opening bid is typically 3 or 4 of a digit I have multiple of. I have two 3s, and previous rounds have shown 3s to be common. Therefore, I will start with a conservative opening bid of 3 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand (33800692). The current bid is 3 3s, and there are 24 total digits in play. Based on my hand, I know 2 of those 3s already, which means there only needs to be 1 more 3 among the other 16 digits held by the other players for the current bid to be valid. This seems quite likely. Since I need to make a higher bid, I could either increase the quantity to 4 3s or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit. Looking at my hand, I have one 6, one 8, one 9, and one 0. I don't have any 4s or 5s, so bidding on those would be riskier. I'll bid 3 6s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit. This is a conservative move that's likely to be valid based on my hand.

To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since I have one 6, and there are two other players, it's possible that there are at least 3 or more 6s in total. However, bidding more than 3 6s might be risky. I can bid 3 7s, keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit, as my hand contains a 7, making it plausible that there could be 3 or more 7s across all hands.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. In my hand (15381037), I have two 7s. With 24 digits in play and two unknown hands, it's very possible there is at least one more 7 among the other players, making the bid plausible. Raising to 3 8s is risky since I only have one 8, but bidding 3 8s is the minimum valid higher bid. However, since I have two 7s, I can safely raise the quantity to 4 for 7s, leveraging my strong holding of that digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (33800692), I have zero 7s. Player 4 has bid 4 7s, meaning they believe there are at least 4 sevens among all players. Since I have none, those 4 sevens would need to be distributed between Player 2 and Player 4. Each player has 8 digits, so it's certainly possible. However, given that Player 2 bid '3 7s' before Player 4 raised to '4 7s', it suggests Player 2 might have 3 sevens and Player 4 might have 1 or more. I need to either challenge or make a higher bid. Since I have two 8s in my hand, I could reasonably bid '4 8s' which would be higher than '4 7s'. This seems safer than challenging, as the current bid is quite plausible.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have the hand 73795408, which contains one 8. This means there are at least 2 other 8s in the other hands. I can make a higher bid by either increasing the quantity or bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have two 7s, I know there are at least 4 sevens (2 from my hand and potentially 2 from other hands). Bidding 5 7s is a reasonable move as it increases the quantity and is based on my hand's information. However, I should check if there's a more conservative or aggressive bid. Bidding 4 9s is also an option as it keeps the quantity the same but bids on a higher digit.

My two 7s mean there need to be three more among the 16 digits held by Players 0 and 2. That's possible, but not guaranteed. However, it's not outlandish enough to challenge. Instead, I can safely raise the bid to 5 8s, since I have two 8s, making it more likely for me and increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 5 8s, meaning Player 4 is claiming there are at least 5 eights among all players. With 24 total digits in play and 8 in my hand, there are 16 digits I can't see. I know there's 1 eight in my hand, so for the bid to be true, there need to be at least 4 more eights in the remaining 16 digits (25% of the unseen digits would need to be eights). This seems unlikely but not impossible. I could bid 6 8s, but that would be even more unlikely. I could also switch to a higher digit (9) or a different digit entirely. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 0s, and one each of 6, 9, and 2. Given that I've already bid 4 8s earlier, and Player 4 raised to 5 8s, I think there's a good chance Player 4 actually has some 8s. I'll bid 5 9s, keeping the quantity the same but raising the digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have the hand 73795408, which contains one 9. So, the total count of 9s across all three players is at least 1 (mine) plus whatever Player 0 and Player 4 have. Given that Player 0 made the bid, they likely have at least one 9. It's possible that the total count of 9s is 5 or more if Player 4 also has some 9s. However, bidding higher than 5 9s requires a quantity greater than 5 or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since the maximum quantity is 24 and there are 24 digits in total, bidding 6 0s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity. I will bid 6 0s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. In my hand (15381037), I have one 0. Statistically, with 24 digits in play and three players, the expected number of any single digit is about 2.4. For there to be 6 zeros is above average and unlikely, especially since I only have one. Unless one of the other two players has a very high number of zeros (e.g., 3 or 4 each), the bid is likely a bluff or a stretch. Given the low probability and my own hand, I should challenge.

Since I already have 2 threes in my hand alone, I know this bid is definitely valid. I could challenge, but I would lose since the actual count is at least 2. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I could bid 3 3s, which would be reasonable since I already have 2 threes. Alternatively, I could bid 2 4s, 2 5s, etc. Since I have a 6, 8, 9 in my hand, I might want to bid on one of those digits.

Since I have only one 6, Player 0 would need to have at least one 6 for their bid to be valid. Statistically, it's reasonable that Player 0 could have one or more 6s in their hand, so challenging now would be risky. The next valid bid would be either 2 7s (since 2 7s is higher than 2 6s), or 3 0s (increasing the quantity). My hand has two 3s and one 7. Bidding 2 7s would be risky, as I only have one 7. I also have one 0. The safest higher bid based on my hand is 2 7s, since it's possible Player 0 has at least one 7. Alternatively, I could bid 3 3s, as I have two 3s, but that increases the quantity, which is more aggressive. I'll opt for the less risky increment: 2 7s.

Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (33800692), I have zero 7s. Since there are only 16 total digits in play (8 from me and 8 from Player 4), and I know 8 of those digits, I need to evaluate whether it's likely that Player 4 has at least 2 sevens in their hand. From my hand, I have two 3s, one 8, one 0, one 6, one 9, and one 2. I don't have any 7s, 1s, 4s, or 5s. Player 4 has previously shown a pattern of bidding on 3s and later on higher digits (7s and 8s). Since Player 4 only needs 2 sevens in their 8 digits for their bid to be valid, this is certainly possible. I could bid higher with '2 8s' since I have one 8 in my hand, or '2 9s' since I have one 9, or '3 0s' since I have one 0. I'll choose to bid '2 9s' as it's a safe increment while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 15381037. The current bid is 2 9s. I have no 9s in my hand, so for the bid to be valid, Player 0 must have at least 2 9s. This is possible but not likely, as the probability of holding 2 or more 9s in 8 digits is low. However, making a minimal higher bid is safe for now. I have two 3s and two 7s in my hand, so I can safely bid 3 3s, since I already hold two and only need one from Player 0.

Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. In my hand (33800692), I have two 3s. The current bid is '3 3s', meaning Player 4 is claiming there are at least 3 threes between our hands. Since I already have 2 threes, this bid is quite reasonable - Player 4 only needs to have 1 more three in their hand. Looking at the bidding history, Player 4 started with '2 3s', which suggests they might have at least one 3. Given that I have 2 threes, I should either bid higher or bid a different digit. I could bid '3 4s', but I don't have any 4s. I could bid '3 5s', but I don't have any 5s either. I do have one 6, one 8, one 9, and one 0. Since I have one 6, bidding '3 6s' would require Player 4 to have two 6s, which is possible but not guaranteed. I think a safer move is to increase the quantity and bid '4 0s', as I have one 0 and there's a reasonable chance Player 4 has at least three 0s.
