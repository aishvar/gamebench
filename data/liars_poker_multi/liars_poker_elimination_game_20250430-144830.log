Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand, which is a strong starting position. With 6 players and 8 digits each (48 total), there's a good chance of more 6s in other hands. Starting with '4 6s' is reasonably conservative - it only requires finding one more 6 among the other 40 digits I can't see, while using a high-value digit that I'm confident in.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 0, 2, 2, 1, 8, 3, 5, 2. Counting the 6s in my hand: zero. Since I have no 6s, the maximum total 6s across all players is at most 4, which is the current bid. To challenge would be logical because the bid of 4 6s is unlikely to be accurate, given my hand and the total digits. Challenging now could eliminate the previous bidder if the count is less than 4, which seems probable. Alternatively, I could bid higher with the same digit (5 6s), but that would be risky given my hand. Bidding 4 7s is not possible because I have no 7s. Therefore, the best move is to challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand, which is a strong starting position. Since I won the last round with a bid of 4 6s and still have three 6s, it's reasonable to start with a similar bid. With 5 players and 8 digits each (40 total), and knowing I have three 6s, there's a good chance of finding at least one more 6 among the other 32 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, and with 40 digits total the probability of there being at least four 6s is slightly above 50%, so challenging is risky. I do have one 7, so bidding 4 7s is a safe way to raise the digit without increasing quantity, and it’s plausible (~66% chance).

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 2, which is higher than Player 0's bid of 4 6s. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than 4 7s. I have the digits 1, 3, 5, 1, 4, 0, 2, 7 in my hand, totaling 8 digits. I can see that I have one 7 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 7, bidding a higher digit seems more feasible. Bidding 4 8s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and I have no 8s but it's a plausible bet considering other players might have them.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which means there are at least 3 more 8s among the other 4 players (32 digits). While this is possible, it's a high bid given that 8s are not overly common. However, challenging now might be risky since there's a reasonable chance the bid is valid. I can make a safer bid by increasing the quantity to 5 with a lower digit, like 5 0s, to keep the game going and see if others challenge.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand (73252438). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll base my decision on my hand and the total count. The maximum possible count for any digit is 40 (8 digits per player * 5 players). A bid of 5 0s suggests there are at least 5 zeros. I have one 0, so there are at least 4 more zeros among the other players. Increasing the quantity to 6 seems reasonable if I consider that there could be more 1s than 0s, given the previous bids (4 6s, 4 7s, 4 8s). However, my hand doesn't have many high digits, but it has a good distribution. I will increase the digit instead of the quantity because my hand doesn't strongly support a significantly higher quantity of any digit. Thus, bidding 5 1s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have only 1 one in my hand (90016663), and the current bid claims there are 5 ones total. While possible, this seems unlikely given: 1) I only have 1 one, 2) ones aren't typically kept by players since they're low value, 3) it would require 4 ones among the other 32 digits (4 players × 8 digits), which is a high concentration. Given my knowledge of my own hand and the probability distribution, challenging seems safer than making a higher bid of 5 2s or 6 anything.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can make any bid as my first bid. I have one 7 and one 3 in my hand (73252438), so I know there are at least two 3s or 7s. I will start by bidding a relatively conservative quantity. Bidding 6 3s seems reasonable as it is a low to moderate quantity considering there are 32 total digits and I have one 3.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand. There are 24 other digits and the expected number of 3s among them is only 2.4, giving an expected total of about 3.4 3s. The probability of there being at least 6 3s is under 10%, so Player 5’s bid of 6 3s is very unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 2 9s leverages a low quantity with the highest digit, giving me about an 81% chance that at least two 9s exist. It also forces opponents to raise the quantity to 3 for any subsequent bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s made by Player 2. I have 8 secret digits: 13514027. I see that I have one 9 in my hand. Considering there are 3 active players and 24 total digits remaining, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. Given that I have one 9 and there are 2 other players, bidding 3 9s seems reasonable as it accounts for my 9 and potentially 2 more 9s from the other players.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand (76415741). The current bid is 3 9s, which means there would need to be at least 3 9s among the other two players' hands (Player 2 and Player 3). Given that the maximum possible 9s in the remaining 16 digits (24 total - my 8) is 16, but the likelihood of at least 3 9s is uncertain. However, since I have no 9s, it's risky to challenge immediately. I can make a conservative bid to keep the game going and see how the others react.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which is already high considering there are only 24 digits in total and 16 digits in other players' hands. The probability of having 3 or more 9s across all hands is low given my hand. Therefore, challenging seems like the best move.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 7s and two 4s in my hand. Since the current bid is None and I am the first to bid in this round, I should make a conservative bid based on my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold one 7, so the current bid of 2 7s needs at least one more 7 among the 8 unknown digits—a ~57% chance it’s true, making a challenge (~43% chance to win) unfavorable. Instead, I hold one 8, so raising to 2 8s also has about a 57% chance to be true and applies pressure with minimal risk.
