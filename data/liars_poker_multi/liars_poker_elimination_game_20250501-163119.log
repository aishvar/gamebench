Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Opening with 4 8s requires only two more 8s among the 40 unknown digits, which is roughly a 92% chance, making it a strong first bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. I can't be sure if the bid is valid, but I'm unlikely to have a winning bid with only one 8. Challenging seems like the best option since the bid might be bluffing, and even if it's not, I don't have a strong hand to make a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With 40 digits total, a uniform distribution implies about 4 8s across all hands, so expecting at least three more among the other 32 digits is reasonable. Bidding 5 8s is plausible and builds a strong starting point.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:0 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have the hand 36238339, which contains two 3s and three 8s. Since I have three 8s, the total count of 8s must be at least 3 (mine) + unknown others. Given that there are 4 other players and each has 8 digits, it's plausible that the total count of 8s is around or more than 5. However, I can see that my hand has a significant number of 8s, supporting the bid to some extent. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I can bid 6 8s or 5 9s. Since I don't have any 9s in my hand, bidding 5 9s seems risky as it requires at least one other player to have a 9. Bidding 6 8s is more reasonable as it is a relatively small increase in quantity and I know my hand contributes to the count. Thus, I will bid 6 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have only one 8 in my hand. The previous round revealed exactly 4 8s with 48 total digits. Now with 40 digits, Player 2 claims there are 6 8s. Given I only see one 8, and the previous round only had 4 8s total (with more digits in play), it seems highly unlikely there are 6 or more 8s. The bid of 6 8s is probably a bluff.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have a strong hand with two 5s and one each of 6,7,8,9. As the first bidder in this round with 32 total digits in play, I should start conservatively. Since I have two 5s, bidding three 5s is relatively safe as I only need one more 5 among the other 24 digits held by other players.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:1 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 34220967, which contains no 5s. The current bid by Player 3 is 3 5s. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 3 5s is plausible as it represents less than 10% of the total digits, and I have none myself. I don't feel confident challenging this bid as it seems reasonable. Instead, I will make a higher bid. I have two 2s in my hand, so bidding 4 2s feels like a safe increase in quantity while switching to a digit I have some of. However, since 2 is less than 5, I need to increase the quantity or move to a higher digit. I’ll bid 3 6s, as I have one 6 in my hand, and it’s a higher digit than 5, making it a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 7s in my hand, so I’m hesitant to support a bid on 7s. I do have two 8s, and with 24 unknown cards we expect about 2.4 more 8s, making a total of at least 3 8s very likely (~91% chance). Bidding 3 8s safely raises the digit without increasing quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have my hand of 75689559 which contains zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s. From the game history, we know there were 4 8s in an earlier round with 6 players, and that number dropped to 4 8s when there were 5 players. Now with only 4 players remaining, it's very unlikely there are still 3 8s total, especially since I have none in my hand. The previous rounds suggest 8s are relatively scarce, and some were likely eliminated with eliminated players. This makes the current bid of 3 8s highly improbable.

Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 8s and there are 16 unknown digits, so I expect about 1.6 more 8s. Bidding 3 8s gives roughly an 81% chance of being correct, making it a safe opening bid.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:1 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 34220967, which contains no 8s. The current bid by Player 0 is 3 8s with a total of 24 digits across three players. Given that I have zero 8s, the bid of 3 8s means all 3 must come from the other two players' hands (16 digits total). While it's possible, the probability seems low since it would require at least 18.75% of their digits to be 8s (3 out of 16). However, looking at the history, Player 0 has bid on 8s consistently and has won challenges on bids of 4 8s and 3 8s previously, suggesting they likely have a strong count of 8s. Since the bid is only 3, it's safer to assume it's plausible. I’ll make a higher bid instead of challenging. I have two 9s in my hand, so bidding 4 9s feels reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a valid higher bid.
