Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 6, two 4s, one 8, one 9, zero 0s, and one 5 in my hand. Since no bids have been made yet, I want to start with a modest bid that is likely to be true across all players. The digit 4 appears twice in my hand, and it's reasonable to expect at least 6 or more 4s among all 48 digits. Therefore, I will open with a bid of 6 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. I have one 5 in my hand. I could bid 7 0s, which is a valid higher bid. However, I also have three 5s. Bidding 7 0s seems weak, as I have no 4s. I could bid 7 1s, but I only have one 1. I could bid 7 2s, 7 3s, etc., all the way to 7 9s. However, I have three 5s, so bidding 7 5s seems like a better move than bidding a higher number with a digit I don't have. Bidding 7 5s is a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 7 5s and my hand containing 08570118, I notice I have one 5. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 players, it's plausible that the total count of 5s could be around or slightly above 7, given that each player has 8 digits. However, without more information about other players' hands, making a bid that is strictly higher seems risky. I could bid a higher quantity of 5s or switch to a higher digit. Since my hand does not contain any digit in a quantity that would safely allow me to bid higher without risk, and considering the bid of 7 5s might be plausible but not extremely high given the total possible count of any digit could be up to 48, challenging seems like a viable option. Yet, given the rules and the aim to make a strategic move, bidding on a digit that appears more frequently or seems more plausible based on the current bid and my hand seems like a safer strategy. My hand contains two 1s and one 8, among other digits. Since bidding on 5s might be risky without knowing the exact distribution, and I have no 5s to add confidence to bidding higher on 5s, I should consider the next plausible digit or quantity. Given that I have two 1s and considering the distribution might favor lower digits due to the nature of the game and the starting bids, a strategic move could be to increase the quantity or move to a digit that is either higher or seems more likely to occur based on my hand and the game's progression. However, my hand does not strongly support a significantly higher bid on any specific digit without more insight into other players' hands. Thus, considering the need to make a strictly higher bid and the information available, a cautious approach would be to either challenge the current bid if it seems unlikely or make a bid that is reasonably higher based on the information I have. Given these considerations and the fact that I need to make a move that is strictly higher than 7 5s, and without strong evidence to safely challenge or significantly increase the bid on 5s, I must weigh the risks and potential rewards of each action. Challenging the bid of 7 5s could be risky if the total count of 5s indeed meets or exceeds 7, given the number of players and digits in play. On the other hand, making a bid that is too high could also be risky. Therefore, the decision hinges on whether I believe the current bid is likely or unlikely and whether I have enough information to make a higher bid confidently.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. There are 40 unknown digits, so the expected number of 1s among them is 4, giving an expected total of 6. A bid of 8 1s is unlikely (around a 20% chance), so it’s better to challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. With 40 total digits and uniform distribution, the expected total count of 9s is 2 (in my hand) + (32 × 0.1) ≈ 5.2. Bidding 5 9s is below this expectation (≈64% chance of being true) and uses the highest digit, preventing same-quantity raises. Therefore I start with 5 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits: 19552404. I see that I have two 9s in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 40 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Since my hand alone can contribute 2 9s, and there are 4 other players, bidding 4 9s seems conservative and increases the quantity from the current bid. However, I should also consider the likelihood of higher digits being less frequent. Bidding 6 0s seems risky as it might not be feasible with the current hands. Therefore, increasing the quantity slightly while sticking with a digit that I have in my hand seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge Player 4's bid of 6 9s. Looking at my hand (78829133), I have 0 nines. Player 4 bid that there are at least 6 nines among all 5 active players. Since I have 0 nines, that means the other 4 players would need to have at least 6 nines between them, or an average of 1.5 nines per player. This is possible but somewhat high. Given that I have no nines and the previous player raised from 5 to 6 nines, I'm suspicious that Player 4 might be bluffing. The probability seems low enough to warrant a challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning I can make any initial bid. I have the digits 1, 9, 5, 5, 2, 4, 0, 4 in my hand. I see that there are 4 active players and we each have 8 digits. To start strong, I should bid a quantity and digit that seems plausible but also considers my own hand. I have two 5s and two 4s. Bidding 4 5s seems reasonable as it reflects my hand and leaves room for others to bid higher or challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. To raise the bid, I must bid at least 4 6s or higher. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 4 6s is a reasonable increase and plausible given my hand and total digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, which is a safe but potentially weak bid. I could also challenge, but without any strong reason to believe the bid is incorrect, it's risky. Since I have three 5s, I could bid 5 5s. However, Player 4 already bid 4 5s. I will bid 5 0s as it is the safest option.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have 0 zeros in my hand, so all 5 zeros must be among the other 24 digits. With an expected 2.4 zeros and a standard deviation of about 1.5, the probability of seeing 5 or more is under 5%. The bid of 5 zeros is very unlikely, so I should challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. With 22 unknown cards, the chance of at least one more 9 is over 90%, making “3 9s” a very safe opening bid. By choosing the highest digit at quantity 3, I also force any opponent who wants to raise to jump to quantity 4, which gives me greater control of the bidding.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 3. I have the hand 19552404, which contains one 9. Given that there are only 24 digits in total and three players, the maximum possible count for any digit is 24. The current bid of 3 9s seems plausible but not extremely high. I have one 9 and potentially two more 9s could exist among the other players' hands, making 3 9s possible. However, I can increase the quantity or the digit to make a higher bid. I will bid 4 0s as it is a higher quantity than 3 9s and there are 0s in my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s by Player 4. I have one 0 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since the current bid is 4 0s, the next higher bid could be 4 1s or 5 0s. I have one 4 and two 6s, which are digits I have multiple of, so bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it is a higher digit than 0 at the same quantity, and I have two 6s in my hand. This bid is believable and puts pressure on the next player.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Since I hold exactly two, the total count across both hands is guaranteed to be at least two, so any challenge would fail. From my opponent’s perspective, seeing a bid of 2 9s across 16 unknown digits feels unlikely (~48.5%), making this a strong opening that either deters them or lures a mistaken challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s made by Player 3. I have 8 secret digits: 19552404. I can see that I have two 9s in my hand. Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. The current bid of 2 9s seems plausible but I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. Since I have 2 nines and there are only 16 digits in total, bidding a higher quantity or digit must be carefully considered. I will challenge the bid because 2 9s seems unlikely given that I alone have 2 nines, and there could be a maximum of 14 other digits that could potentially have 9s but it's unlikely both players have 9s distributed in a way that exactly meets or exceeds 2 9s without me having more information.
