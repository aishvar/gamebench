Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand contains no 6s, and with 48 total digits across all players, it's possible the actual count of 6s is below 4. Challenging this bid could expose the inaccuracy, especially since I have no 6s to contribute to the total.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 0s. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid that reflects my hand's composition. Bidding 3 0s increases the quantity beyond my current count, assuming others may have additional 0s. This balances risk and leverage based on my known digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. The current bid is 3 0s. Bidding 3 2s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity. With 32 remaining digits across four players, the expected number of 2s is 3.2, making this a reasonable and defensible bid. Challenging the current bid would risk elimination given the expected value slightly exceeds 3.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s. Bidding 4 8s increases the quantity while leveraging my strong holding in 8s, which is statistically likely to be supported by other players' hands given the total digits remaining.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 8s' by Player 3 and my hand containing two 8s (29536088), I must assess the likelihood of this bid being true. Since there are 40 total digits remaining and 5 players, including myself, it's possible for the bid to be valid if other players also have 8s in their hands. However, with my knowledge of having two 8s, bidding higher seems like a strategic move. Considering the total possible count for any digit is 40 and aiming to make a reasonable increase, I should look to increase either the quantity or the digit. Given that increasing the digit from 8 to 9 would require a significant number of 9s (which seems unlikely given no previous bids on 9s), the safer bet might be to increase the quantity of 8s, if feasible, or consider another digit. Since my hand does not offer a clear advantage in any other digit to safely bid higher, and given the risk of challenging without clear evidence of the bid being false, I must weigh the risks carefully. The presence of two 8s in my hand suggests that bidding on 8s could be viable, but I must consider if the total count could realistically meet or exceed the next logical bid. The next logical increase would be to bid '5 8s', considering the current bid is '4 8s'. This increases the quantity by one, which seems a reasonable step given my contribution to the total count of 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 35990997, which contains two 9s and no 8s. The current bid is 5 8s, meaning at least five 8s among all 40 digits. Since I have zero 8s, the probability that the remaining 32 digits (in the other 4 hands) contain at least five 8s is plausible, but not exceedingly high or low. With no information about other players' hands, it would be risky to challenge at this point. The safest move is to make a minimal higher bid. I have two 9s, so bidding 5 9s is reasonable and keeps my options open.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. My hand contains no 9s, and with 40 total digits across all players, it's unlikely there are at least 5 9s. Challenging this bid is a reasonable risk given the low probability of the bid being true.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first to bid this round, and my hand contains three 9s and two 0s. As the opening bidder, I should make a reasonable but non-revealing bid. Bidding 3 9s leverages my strong position in 9s without being overly aggressive, and it sets a baseline for the round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which I cannot increase in digit. Bidding 4 2s is a valid higher bid (increasing quantity) and leverages my existing 2s to make the bid more plausible. Challenging 3 9s carries risk since the expected number of 9s in 24 digits is 2.4, but it's possible there are 3. A safer approach is to raise the quantity on a digit I hold.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand, which contributes to the current bid of 4 2s. However, challenging risks elimination if Player 2 has at least one more 2 (making the total â‰¥4). Instead, bidding 4 8s leverages my three 8s and the historical prevalence of 8s in previous bids, making this a safer and stronger move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 8s' and my hand '29536088', I have two 8s and one 9. Considering the total digits remaining is 32 and there are 4 active players, each having 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 32. Since I already have two 8s, it's possible that other players might have more 8s, but bidding higher than '4 8s' requires careful consideration. However, I also notice that bidding the same quantity but a higher digit could be a viable strategy. Given that I have a 9, which is higher than 8, and considering the game's progression and the fact that '5 9s' was a winning bid earlier, I think I can make a reasonable bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same as the current bid or slightly higher, taking into account the total number of digits and the distribution among players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have four 9s in my hand (digits: 3, 5, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 7). The current bid is 4 9s. There are 32 digits in play, so statistically, each digit should appear about 3.2 times per player. Since I personally hold four 9s, it's possible but not certain that there are more 9s among the remaining 24 digits. However, since I have the maximum number of 9s possible in a single hand, the likelihood that there are five or more 9s total is low, making it risky for others to bid higher. However, since the current bid is exactly what I have, I cannot challenge it (as it is plausible). I must make a higher bid. The safest option is to increase the digit to 4 0s, since I have one 0 and it's less likely that others have many 0s, but still a legal progression. Alternatively, I could bid 5 9s, but that seems too risky given I have all four 9s and it's unlikely there is a fifth. Therefore, I will bid 4 0s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have four 9s in my hand (digits: 3, 5, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 7). The current bid is 4 9s, which means that to challenge, I would have to believe there are fewer than four 9s among all 32 digits. Since I alone have four 9s, the bid is guaranteed to be met. Therefore, I must make a higher bid. The next valid bid would be 5 0s (quantity increases), or 4 9s -> 4 0s (not allowed, since digit is lower), or 4 9s -> 4 Xs where X>9 (not possible). The only strictly higher bid is 5 0s, 5 1s, ..., 5 9s. Since I have one 0, bidding 5 0s is risky, but I have four 9s, so bidding 5 9s again is reasonable.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, and the current bid is 5 9s. Given that there are 32 total digits and 9s are relatively rare, a bid of 5 9s is plausible but not guaranteed. Bidding 6 2s leverages my two 2s and increases the quantity, which is a safer move than challenging a bid that may still be accurate based on prior history.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand. The current bid of 6 2s requires at least six 2s across all players. Since I only have two 2s, the remaining 24 digits would need at least four more 2s to meet the bid. Given the risk of challenging and the strength of my 8s, bidding 6 8s is a valid higher bid that leverages my hand's high concentration of 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 6 8s and my hand containing two 8s, I need to assess the likelihood of this bid being true. With 32 total digits remaining and 4 players, including myself, having 8 digits each, the maximum number of any digit could be 32 if all players had the same digit repeated. However, this is highly unlikely. Considering my own hand has two 8s, and assuming other players might also have some 8s, bidding higher seems risky. The current bid of 6 8s might be plausible but challenging it could be a good strategy if I believe it's unlikely that there are at least 6 eights among all players. Given that I have two 8s and considering the distribution of digits, I think challenging is a safer bet than trying to bid higher, which would require a significant presence of a higher digit or the same digit in higher quantities across all players.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 8s in my hand (digits: 5,5,8,4,2,8,8,2). Bidding 4 8s is logical since I already hold 3/8 of the required quantity, and with 24 total digits across 3 players, it's plausible the remaining players have at least one more 8. This bid leverages my strong position in 8s while staying conservative enough to avoid immediate challenge risk.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have no 8s in my hand (my digits are 3, 5, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 7), so the probability that there are 4 or more 8s among the remaining 16 digits held by Players 2 and 3 is low, but not impossible. However, since this is the opening bid for this round, it is a relatively conservative bid and not outrageous. Challenging now is risky, especially since I have no direct evidence the bid is false. Instead, I should make a higher bid based on my hand. I have four 9s, so bidding 4 9s is a safe and legal increment (same quantity, higher digit).

Player 5 Reasoning: It's my turn to open the bidding with no prior bids. My hand contains four 9s (3, 5, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 7). Bidding 4 9s is a strong opening: it's based on my own hand's strength and puts pressure on my opponent, who is unlikely to have more than 2 or 3 9s. Bidding higher would be unnecessarily risky, and bidding lower is not allowed. Therefore, I will start with 'BID: 4 9s'.
