Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 3 3s. Bidding 3 4s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 4 to suggest a plausible higher requirement.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have one 4 and one 6 in my hand. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move as it increases both the quantity and the digit. Challenging 3 4s is unlikely to succeed, as there's a good chance at least three 4s exist among the six players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains one 4 and one 6. The current bid is 4 6s, which I hold only one of. To beat this bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I cannot increase the quantity beyond 4 without risking an unlikely count, I should consider challenging because the bid of 4 6s seems high given my hand and total digits. The total possible count for 6s is at most 6 (if all players have a 6), but I only have one 6, and others may have none. The previous bids of 3 4s and 3 3s are not directly relevant, but the current bid of 4 6s is quite high and unlikely. Challenging now is a strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 7s and one 8 in my hand. The last round ended with a challenge that failed, so players might be more cautious. Bidding 2 7s seems like a safe and strategic move, as it's a modest increase in digit while keeping the quantity low. This should encourage other players to bid more aggressively, increasing the chance of a challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 7s and one 8 in my hand. With 32 digits remaining and no bids yet, I should start with a cautious but reasonable bid. Bidding 3 7s seems safe, as it's likely there are at least three 7s among the four players' hands.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 06396644, which contains no 7s. The current bid is 3 7s by Player 2. With 32 total digits across 4 players, it's possible that there are at least 3 7s in the game, as I have none. However, looking at the bidding history, Player 2 has been successful with bids on 7s before, so they might have some in their hand. I don't want to risk a challenge yet since 3 7s is a relatively low bid and plausible. Instead, I will make a higher bid. I have three 6s in my hand, so bidding 4 6s feels safe enough to potentially push others to challenge or bid higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, but that seems risky. I could also bid 4 7s, but that's only slightly higher. Given the game history and the fact that Player 5 just bid 4 6s, I'll play it safe and bid a slightly higher quantity on a low number. I will bid 5 0s.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:4 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. My hand contains one 0, and the expected total number of 0s across 32 digits is ~3.2 (3.4 with my 0). Bidding 5 0s is statistically unlikely unless others have 4+ 0s. Challenging risks elimination if the bid is valid, but the probability of 5+ 0s being true is low. This is a high-risk challenge, but the bid appears inflated.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make a reasonable opening bid. My hand contains two 2s, and with three players in total, it's plausible there's at least one more 2 in other hands. Bidding 3 2s provides a conservative starting point based on my own digits while allowing room for others to raise the bid. This balances aggression with the likelihood of the bid being true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 7 and one 8 in my hand. Player 1 bid 3 2s. Bidding 4 7s seems reasonable because 4 7s is a higher bid than 3 2s, and it is possible given the remaining digits. I don't have enough information to reasonably challenge the bid.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 06396644, which contains no 7s. The current bid by Player 2 is 4 7s across all 24 digits in play among the three active players. Since I have zero 7s, the bid implies that the other two players must collectively have at least 4 7s in their 16 digits. Looking at the bidding history, Player 2 has consistently bid on 7s in previous rounds (2 7s and 3 7s), and won a challenge on 2 7s when the actual count was 4, suggesting they may have some 7s. However, with no 7s in my hand, I find it somewhat unlikely that 4 or more 7s exist in just 16 digits. I could challenge, but the risk is high if Player 2 has a strong hand of 7s. Instead, I’ll make a safer bid. My hand has three 6s, so I can confidently bid higher on 6s. I’ll bid 5 6s, as it’s a higher quantity than the current bid of 4 7s, and I know at least 3 of those 6s exist in my hand, making it somewhat plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 5 7s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity. I have one 7 in my hand, making it plausible that there are at least 5 7s across all players. This bid is higher than the current one and leverages my existing 7 to justify the claim.

Player 2 Reasoning: Player 1 bid 5 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. With 24 digits remaining across 3 players, it's possible but unlikely that there are 5 7s. I should challenge this bid, as it seems risky for Player 1.

Player 2 Reasoning: There are 16 digits remaining total. I have two 7s and one 6 in my hand. I have previously won bids with 4 6s and 4 7s, so I know there are at least 6 6s and 7s remaining. Bidding 5 7s is a reasonable move since I know there are at least 4 7s remaining (from the previous round).

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 06396644, which contains no 7s. The current bid by Player 2 is 5 7s out of a total of 16 digits across both hands. Since I have zero 7s, Player 2 would need to have at least 5 7s in their 8-digit hand for the bid to be true, which is possible but statistically unlikely (about a 0.3% chance assuming random distribution). However, Player 2 has a history of making aggressive bids on 7s, as seen in previous rounds (bidding 2 7s, 3 7s, and 4 7s, with counts often exceeding their bids). Given this pattern, it's plausible they have a strong hand with several 7s. Bidding higher, such as 6 6s, is risky since I only have three 6s, and with only 16 total digits, pushing the quantity higher increases the risk of being challenged. Challenging now might be premature given Player 2's bidding history, so I’ll make a conservative higher bid of 5 8s to shift the digit and test their response.
