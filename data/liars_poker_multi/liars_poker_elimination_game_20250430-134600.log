Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player to bid, I need to make a reasonable starting bid. I have three 2s in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count of any digit is around 4. Bidding based on my hand is a good starting strategy. Bidding 3 2s is a safe and reasonable starting bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '2' in my hand. The current bid is '3 2s', which is plausible given that there are 48 total digits remaining across 6 players' hands. Since I have no '3's or higher quantity of any digit, I should challenge the bid as it's unlikely that there are three '2's among all players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: It is the start of a new round, and I am the first bidder. I have four 2s in my hand (82152272). With 5 players remaining and 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. Bidding 4 2s is a safe starting bid based on my strong hand in 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 2s and my hand containing 07674949, I notice I have one 2 and one 7, and no other repeating digits. Considering the total digits remaining is 40 and there are 5 players, the bid of 4 2s seems plausible but not extremely high. However, without knowing the distribution of other players' hands, making a significantly higher bid might be risky. Since I have a 7 in my hand, bidding on a higher digit seems like a strategic move. Increasing the quantity or digit from the current bid while considering the potential distribution of digits among other players is key. Given that I only have one 2, and the current bid is already for 4 2s, bidding higher on 2s might not be the best strategy without more information. Instead, looking at higher digits that could potentially appear more frequently across all hands, such as 4, 6, 7, or 9, could be beneficial. Noticing my hand has a 7 and considering the potential for other players to have higher digits, a reasonable next step could be to increase the digit, aiming for something that might be more commonly found in a spread of numbers. However, since the goal is to make a strictly higher bid and considering the risk of overbidding, a cautious approach would be to slightly increase the quantity or move to a higher digit if the quantity remains the same. Given these considerations and aiming to make a strategic move that balances risk and potential gain, challenging the current bid might not be the best option unless the bid seems extremely unlikely, which 4 2s does not, given the information provided.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have no 2s in my hand (07978338). The current bid claims there are 5 twos among all players. With 5 active players having 8 digits each (40 total), and knowing I have zero 2s, there would need to be 5 twos among the other 32 digits (4 players × 8 digits). While possible, given that Player 0's initial bid of 4 2s was confident enough to survive a challenge in the previous round, and Player 2 only increased it by one, this suggests they both likely have some 2s. Based on this, I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. Since I have three 3s in my hand, bidding 5 3s is a safe increase that I'm confident about.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I hold two 9s. There are 32 unknown digits, with an expected 3.2 more 9s (0.1×32), so the chance of at least three more is about 66%, making a total of five 9s quite likely. This bid strictly beats 5 3s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I don't have any 9s in my hand. To bid, I need to increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 6 of any digit seems safer than challenging, as there are still 40 digits in play. I will bid 6 0s.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains three 2s. The current bid is 6 0s.  I need to bid higher. Bidding on 2s is a good strategy given my strong hand in that digit. Bidding 7 2s increases the quantity and is plausible with 5 players and 40 digits remaining, especially since I hold three 2s.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 7 2s and the history of bids, I notice that the digit 2 has been a point of contention before, with Player 0 initially bidding 3 2s and later increasing it to 4 2s, then to 7 2s. I also see that I, as Player 2, previously bid 5 2s. Considering my hand contains a 2 and a 7, and looking at the progression of bids, I must decide whether to challenge or increase the bid. Since the total number of digits is 40 and there are 5 players, the maximum any single digit could appear is 40, assuming all players had the same digit in all their slots, which is highly unlikely. Given that 7 2s is a significant portion of the total possible 2s, especially considering other digits have been bid as well, it seems like a risky bid. However, without knowing the exact distribution of digits among other players, it's hard to gauge the likelihood of 7 2s accurately. Considering I have one 2 in my hand and the bidding history, challenging seems like a safer option than trying to outbid with a higher quantity or a higher digit, given the constraints of the game and the information available.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have two 9s in my hand and considering the total number of digits remaining is 32, bidding on a digit I have in abundance seems strategic. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 4 players with 8 digits each, I should start with a conservative but reasonable bid, considering my own hand and the fact that I don't know the distribution of digits among other players. Bidding 4 9s seems like a reasonable starting point because it's high enough to be challenging but not so high as to be immediately unlikely given my own contribution to the total count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: In my hand, I have no 9s. The current bid of 4 9s from Player 2 seems reasonable since there are 32 total digits in play (8 digits × 4 players). Even with zero 9s in my hand, other players could easily have enough 9s to make this bid valid. Based on my hand, I see I have three 3s, which gives me confidence to bid '5 3s' - increasing the quantity while switching to a digit I know exists in significant numbers.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have zero 3s in my hand. With 32 total digits the expected number of 3s is about 3.2, and among the 24 unknown digits it’s about 2.4. Claiming at least 5 3s is very unlikely (<5% chance given my hand), so I should call the bluff.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand, guaranteeing at least two 1s total. Opening with 2 1s is a safe bid since it cannot be false and forces opponents to either risk a challenge and lose or raise to three of a digit, which is much riskier.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 2s by Player 5, and considering my hand contains a 2, I have to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Since the total number of digits remaining is 24 and we are down to 3 players, each with 8 digits, the distribution of digits becomes crucial. My hand has a 2, which supports the current bid to some extent. However, to make a higher bid, I need to consider the likelihood of higher quantities of digits or moving to a higher digit. Given that I have two 9s and a 7, and considering the bids that have been made previously, especially the challenge outcomes, it seems that players have been somewhat aggressive in their bidding. Since my hand does not provide strong evidence for a significantly higher quantity of 2s or an immediate higher digit, and given the risk of challenging, I must weigh my options carefully. Challenging the bid of 3 2s could be risky if the actual count is indeed 3 or more, considering my single 2 and the potential distribution among other players. Thus, making a bid that is reasonably higher, considering the total digits and previous bids, seems like a safer strategy. I will increase the quantity since moving to a higher digit without strong evidence from my hand could be risky.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have only one ‘2’ in my hand. For the bid of 4 2s to be true, there would need to be at least three 2s among the other 16 cards, which is unlikely (around a 21% chance). It’s more likely the bid is false, so I should challenge.
