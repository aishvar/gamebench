Player 0 Reasoning: I have the digits 3,1,7,5,4,0,5,4 in my hand. The most frequent digit I have is 5 and 4, each appearing twice. Starting the bidding with a modest quantity and a digit I hold twice is a reasonable and safe approach. I will start with 2 5s as the first bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 2 5s, which is likely true. To continue the game, I should increase the quantity to 3 5s. This is a minimal increase and plausible given my hand and the remaining players.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s increases both the quantity and the digit, which aligns with the digits in my hand and is statistically plausible given the average distribution.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 5 6s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on my hand and the fact that other players may also have 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 6 6s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and it's possible given my hand. Bidding a higher digit would be risky as I don't have many of those digits. Challenging seems premature, as 5 6s is not an incredibly high bid given there are 48 total digits and 6 players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '6 6s'. In my hand (11982114), I have zero 6s. There are 6 active players with 8 digits each, for a total of 48 digits. The current bid claims there are at least 6 sixes among all players. Since I have none, all 6 would need to be distributed among the other 5 players, which is possible but getting less likely. On average, each digit appears 4.8 times (48 total digits รท 10 possible digits). The bid of 6 sixes is slightly above average, and without any sixes in my hand, it's becoming suspicious. However, it's not extremely unlikely yet. I could bid 7 6s, but that's risky without any 6s in my hand. I could also bid 6 7s, which is safer since I have one 7 in my hand. I'll go with 6 7s to increase the bid while staying relatively safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. The bids have been steadily increasing in quantity and digit. To make a valid higher bid, I must bid at least 6 8s or 7 of any digit. Since I have no 8s, bidding 6 8s is risky. Bidding 7 0s is a safer increase in quantity and digit, as 0 is a common digit and I have one 0 in my hand. This bid is plausible and forces opponents to raise the quantity significantly or challenge.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:5 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, so at least one 0 exists. The expected total number of 0s across 48 digits is 4.8, making 7 0s plausible but not certain. However, the bid requires 6 additional 0s in the remaining 40 digits, which is less likely given the distribution. Challenging this bid offers a reasonable chance to eliminate Player 0 if the count is insufficient.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable starting bid, as it accounts for my two 5s plus at least one more from other players. This is a conservative yet valid bid given the total 40 digits across 5 players.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid of 3 5s can be outbid by bidding 3 6s (same quantity, higher digit). This is a logical progression given my holdings and the bid hierarchy.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is '3 6s'. I have two 6s in my hand. Given that there are 40 digits remaining across 5 players, it's reasonable to assume there are more 6s in other players' hands. Bidding '4 6s' is a safe increase, as it's likely that at least one more 6 exists among the other players. Challenging seems risky since the bid is relatively low and could be true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 5 6s would be a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit. I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 5, and two 1s. Bidding 4 7s or higher seems risky given I don't have any 7s, 8s, or 9s. Since I have a 6, increasing the quantity to 5 feels like the most logical move.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:3 - claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher than '5 6s' or challenge it. Looking at my hand (11982114), I have zero 6s. The current bid claims there are at least 5 sixes among all players' hands. Since I have none, those 5 sixes would need to be distributed among the other 4 players, who each have 8 digits. This is certainly possible. However, the bidding history shows a pattern of increasing confidence in 6s (from Player 2's '3 6s' to Player 4's '5 6s'). This suggests other players might have some 6s, but probably not many each. For a safe bid, I could go to '5 7s' since I have one 7 in my hand. However, I think '5 6s' is actually pushing the limit of what's likely. With zero 6s in my hand, and considering the bidding pattern, I'll challenge this bid as I believe there are fewer than 5 sixes total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: It's the start of a new round with 32 total digits remaining and 4 players. The previous rounds showed aggressive bidding on 5s and 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable starting bid, slightly higher than the previous bids focusing on 6s. It's not overly aggressive and relies on the possibility of other players also having 6s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand has two 7s and no 6s. The current bid is 4 6s. Bidding 4 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages my two 7s to create a plausible claim. Challenging the 4 6s bid is risky since the expected number of 6s in 24 digits is 2.4, but 4 is within possible range. Bidding 4 7s is more defensible given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have no 7s in my hand, which increases the likelihood that the remaining 24 digits across other players might still be below the bid. Given that the expected average count for any digit across 32 digits is ~3.2, a bid of 4 is slightly above average but uncertain. Since I have zero 7s, the burden of meeting the bid lies entirely on other players. Challenging seems statistically favorable.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Starting the round with a bid of 3 6s leverages the statistical likelihood that at least one additional 6 exists among the remaining 16 digits (total of 24 digits across 3 players). This bid is conservative yet aggressive enough to set a reasonable threshold, as the probability of there being at least one more 6 is high (~81%).

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Considering the game history, players have been aggressive with their bids. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move, increasing the quantity of the current bid's digit based on my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 5 6s is possible, but risky. Bidding 4 7s would be a valid higher bid, but I have no 7s in my hand. Bidding 5 7s is also out of the question. I can also challenge, but given the previous rounds, 4 6s doesn't seem too outrageous, and I only have one 6. Therefore, I will bid 5 6s, hoping the other players don't have many 6s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid of 5 6s requires at least five 6s across all three players. I have two 6s in my hand, meaning Players 3 and 4 must collectively hold at least three 6s for the bid to be valid. Given the high demand for 6s in a 24-digit pool and the lack of visible support from other players' hands, this seems unlikely. Challenging eliminates Player 4 if the bid fails, reducing competition.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Given that there are only 16 digits remaining across both players' hands, it's likely that there are more 6s in total. Bidding 2 6s is a reasonable move, as it increases the quantity while keeping the same digit.
