Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. With 48 total digits, the expected number of 4s across all hands is about 4.8. Opening with a bid of 3 4s leverages my known count and is a conservative, credible starting bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s, which means there needs to be at least two more 4s among the other five players to make the bid valid. Since the probability of having at least two more 4s in the remaining 40 digits is reasonable, I will make a higher bid. I have two 9s in my hand, so I can bid 3 9s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 1. I have 8 secret digits in my hand: 56725541. I can see that I have two 5s, one 6, one 7, and no 9s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48 and there are 6 active players with 8 digits each (total of 48 digits), bidding a high quantity or digit requires careful consideration. Since my hand does not contain any 9s, I can reasonably assume that there might not be many 9s in total. However, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than 3 9s. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have multiple digits that could potentially be high, I should consider what I can reasonably bid. I have two 5s, which could be a good candidate. Bidding 4 5s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and utilizes a digit I know exists in my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s, two 4s, two 2s, one 0, and one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s. Since I only have one 5, for there to be at least four 5s among all players, the other five players would need to collectively have at least three more 5s in their 40 digits, which is plausible. Therefore, challenging now is risky. I can make a safe higher bid based on my hand. I have two 8s, so bidding 4 8s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, and is a reasonable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. My hand is 49123091, which contains two 8s and no 9s. I can count my own 8s, so I know there are at least 2 8s. The total count of 8s must be at least 2. The bid of 4 8s seems plausible because there are 6 players and 48 digits in total. I will increase the quantity to make a higher bid. Bidding 5 8s is a reasonable next step as it is a minimal increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '5 8s' made by Player 4. Looking at my hand (36010713), I don't have any 8s. This means all 5 claimed 8s would need to come from the other 5 players' hands. With 8 digits per player and 6 players total, there are 48 total digits. The probability of at least 5 8s existing when I have none is not extremely low - each other player would only need to have 1 8 on average. However, I notice that Player 3 previously bid '4 8s', suggesting they might have at least one 8. Player 4 then raised to '5 8s', which could indicate they have at least one 8 as well. Given this bidding pattern and the fact that I have no 8s, I think the bid of '5 8s' is reasonable and I shouldn't challenge. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s and one each of 0, 3, 6, 7. I could bid '6 1s' since I have two 1s myself, or I could play it safer with '6 0s' or another digit. Since '6 1s' requires only 4 more 1s among the other 5 players (less than 1 per player on average), I'll go with that.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. With 47 unknown digits, the expected count of 4s among them is about 4.7, giving roughly a 72% chance of seeing at least four more 4s and thus six total. Raising to 6 4s is a valid increase over 6 1s and is reasonably likely.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '4' in my hand. The current bid is '6 4s', which seems high given that there are 48 total digits and only 6 players. The probability of there being at least six '4s' across all hands is relatively low. Since I only have one '4', and the bid is already at six, I think it's unlikely to be true. Therefore, I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s made by Player 0. I have the hand 56725541, which contains two 5s and one 4. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are 40 digits in total. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. My hand does not provide much information about other players' hands, but I can see that bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit than 4 4s is necessary. Since I have two 5s, bidding on 5 seems reasonable. I will bid 5 5s as it is higher than 4 4s in terms of quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains two 5s (digits: 0, 8, 4, 2, 8, 2, 5, 8). The current bid is 5 5s, meaning there must be at least five 5s among all 40 digits. Statistically, with 5 players and 8 digits each, the expected number of any digit is about 4. I have two 5s, so it's plausible there are three more among the other 32 digits. However, it's not certain, and raising the bid slightly is a safe way to keep pressure off myself while not overcommitting. I will bid 5 8s, since I have three 8s in my hand, making this bid more defensible.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have two 8s in my hand (from 49123091). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since there are 40 total digits and 5 players, a bid of 5 8s implies an average of 1 '8' per player. Given that I have 2 '8s', it's plausible that the total count is higher than 5. However, increasing the quantity to 6 or more might be too aggressive. I can bid 5 9s, which is a higher bid because the digit is higher. This seems like a reasonable next step.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze what's in my hand and what's been bid. My hand (36010713) contains: one 0, two 1s, one 3, one 6, one 7, and no 9s. The current bid is '5 9s'. Since I have no 9s in my hand, and there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total digits), there could be at most 5 9s among the other players. The bid of '5 9s' is at the upper limit of what's plausible. To make a higher bid, I would need to bid '6 0s' or higher. I only have one 0 in my hand, so bidding 6 0s would require 5 more 0s among other players, which is possible but risky. Alternatively, I could challenge the current bid of '5 9s'. Since I have no 9s and the bid is already at a high quantity, there's a good chance there aren't 5 9s total. I'll challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding in this round with 4 active players. Looking at my hand (36010713), I have one 0, two 1s, one 3, one 6, one 7, and no 2s, 4s, 5s, 8s, or 9s. Since I need to make the first bid, I should choose a digit I have multiple of to increase my confidence. I have two 1s in my hand, which means there are at least 2 ones among all players. A conservative opening bid would be '2 1s', but I can be a bit more aggressive since I know for certain there are at least 2. I'll bid '3 1s' which is reasonable - even if other players have no 1s, it's only claiming one more than I know exists.

Given that my hand has two 4s, contributing to the count of 4s, and considering the total digits remaining is 32, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems feasible. Since I have two 5s, bidding 4 5s seems reasonable as it increases the digit compared to the current bid of 4 4s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. In my hand (08428258), I have one 5. With 32 digits in play and 4 players, the expected average per digit is 3.2. Bidding 4 5s is slightly above average, but not unreasonable. However, I have three 8s in my hand, which is significantly above average. Therefore, bidding 4 8s is a strong move, as it increases the digit and is supported by my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the likelihood of there being at least 4 8s across all players. Looking at my hand (36010713), I have zero 8s. The current bid is 4 8s, which means Player 3 believes there are at least 4 8s among all 32 digits. Since I have none, all 4 would need to come from the other three players' hands (24 digits total). While this is possible, it's not extremely high. Player 3 has shown some aggression with 8s before (bidding 4 8s and 5 8s in previous rounds), which might indicate they have some 8s in their hand. I could bid 5 0s since I have a 0 in my hand, or 5 1s since I have two 1s. Given my stronger holding in 1s, I'll bid 5 1s to increase the quantity.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 3. I have two 8s in my hand, and there are 16 total digits remaining across both players' hands. Given that there are only two players left, if Player 3 has one 8, I have two, making a total of at least 3 8s possible. However, I need to consider if bidding higher makes sense or if challenging is more strategic. Since my hand contains two 8s and the bid is 3 8s, bidding 4 8s seems risky without knowing Player 3's hand. However, bidding a different digit could be safer and still strategic.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 08428258, which contains two 8s and one 9. The current bid is 3 9s. Since I only have one 9, for Player 2's bid to be valid, they would need to have at least two 9s in their hand. With only 16 digits in play, the probability that Player 2 has two or more 9s is low, especially since high digit bids have previously been challenged and lost (e.g., 5 9s with only 2 present).
