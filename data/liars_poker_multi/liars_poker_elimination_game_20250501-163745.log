Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 4 2s seems reasonable, as there are 48 total digits and others may have 2s as well. This bid leverages my own cards while leaving room for others to contribute to the total.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The last bid is '4 2s', meaning Player 0 claims there are at least 4 twos among all players' hands. Looking at my own hand (70180435), I have zero 2s. With 6 players having 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. If the digits were evenly distributed, we'd expect about 4.8 of each digit (48รท10). So '4 2s' is a reasonable bid statistically. Since I don't have any 2s myself, the remaining 5 players would need to have at least 4 twos between them, which is quite possible. I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. I have one 3, one 4, one 5, and one 0 in my hand. I could bid '4 3s', which is higher than '4 2s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have zero 3s in my hand. Bidding 4 4s would be a reasonable next step, as it increases the digit and maintains the quantity. Alternatively, I could challenge, but 4 3s doesn't seem *unlikely* enough to risk a challenge, especially since other players could have multiple 3s. Bidding 5 2s is also an option, but increasing the quantity to 5 feels risky without knowing the other hands. Therefore, I will bid 4 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 4s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have two 4s in my hand (part of 54479813), and considering the distribution of digits might not be even, bidding on a higher digit or increasing the quantity is necessary. However, given that my hand contains a 5 and no other digits higher than 5 that are repeated, I can consider bidding on 5s. Given the total number of digits is 48 and assuming an even distribution (which is unlikely but a starting point), each digit could appear approximately 4.8 times. This suggests that bidding on a higher quantity of a lower digit or the same quantity of a higher digit could be reasonable. Since I have a 5 and a 9 in my hand, and no 6s, 7s, or 8s, my safest bet, considering I want to increase the bid, is to either increase the quantity of 4s (which would require me to bid 5 4s) or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Given the information and my hand, increasing the quantity seems safer as it doesn't require assuming the presence of higher digits that I don't have in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 95376659. I have zero 4s. The current bid is 5 4s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average number of any digit is 4.8 (48 / 10).  A bid of 5 4s is slightly above average, but not outrageously so, especially early in the game.  However, since I have no 4s, it's less likely there are 5 or more 4s among the other 5 players.  I have two 5s, two 6s, two 9s, one 3, and one 7. I can make a bid based on my hand that is higher than 5 4s. Bidding 5 5s is a direct increase in digit. Bidding 6 of any digit would also be a valid increase. Given I have two 5s, bidding 5 5s seems like a reasonable and supportable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have two 5s in my hand, and the expected total number of 5s across all players is around 6 (based on probability). Challenging risks elimination if the bid is true. Bidding 5 7s leverages my two 7s and assumes others may hold three 7s, which is plausible given the total digits. This bid increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, staying within reasonable probability.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. The current bid is 5 7s. Bidding 6 2s increases the quantity requirement and leverages my strong holding in 2s, which is a statistically plausible bid given the total digits remaining.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (70180435), I have zero 2s. Player 0 has bid 6 2s, which means they're claiming there are at least 6 twos among all 48 digits. This is certainly possible, but I need to assess if it's likely. With 6 players having 8 digits each, the average distribution would be about 4.8 of each digit. Player 0 started with 4 2s and has now increased to 6 2s after seeing other players bid different digits. This suggests they might have some 2s in their hand. However, since I have zero 2s, and the bid is already above average, I think this is a good opportunity to challenge. If the other 5 players have a total of 5 or fewer 2s, I'll win the challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: This is the start of a new round, and I'm the first to bid. Looking at my hand (70180435), I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 7, and one 8. Since I have one 7, I can reasonably assume there are more 7s among the other players. With 5 players having 8 digits each (40 total digits), a conservative first bid would be 3 7s. This is a reasonable starting point that's based on a digit I have in my hand, giving me some confidence in the bid while not being too aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Player 1 bid 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have a 7 to support that claim. Alternatively, I could bid on a different digit, but increasing the quantity of 7s seems the most logical play given my hand and the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 7s and my hand containing no 7s, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least 4 sevens among all active players. With 40 total digits remaining and each player having 8 digits, the maximum number of any single digit is capped. Since I don't have any 7s, I have to rely on the bidding history and the total number of digits left. The previous bid was 3 7s, which suggests that Player 1 believed there were at least three 7s. Player 2 then bid 4 7s, indicating a belief in at least four 7s. Considering the total digits and the fact that we are already at a high quantity for a single digit, I should challenge this bid as it seems unlikely that there are at least 4 sevens given the distribution of digits and the bids made so far.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I can bid anything. I have one 7 in my hand. Player 1 bid 3 7s last round and won, and I bid 4 7s and also won. It seems like there are a decent number of 7s in play. I will bid 2 7s to start conservatively, as the total number of digits is now 32 and we have fewer players.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 95376659. I have one 7. The current bid is 2 7s. With 32 total digits and 4 players, the average count for any digit is 3.2 (32 / 10). A bid of 2 7s is slightly below average, and I have one 7. It's plausible that there are at least two 7s among the other players. I also have two 5s, two 6s, and two 9s. Bidding 3 5s, 3 6s, or 3 9s are all valid higher bids based on my hand and the current bid. Bidding 3 5s is a reasonable next step.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s, which is likely true given the expected distribution of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of 4 5s by Player 5. Looking at my hand (70180435), I have one 5. With 32 total digits in play and 4 players with 8 digits each, there need to be at least 3 more 5s among the other three players for the bid to be valid. This is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's a risky move given that I only know my own hand. Alternatively, I can make a higher bid. My options are to bid 5 5s or 4 with a higher digit (4 6s, 4 7s, etc.). I have one 0, one 1, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 7, and two 8s in my hand. Since I have two 8s, bidding 4 8s would be safer than other options, as I'm already contributing half of the required quantity. This seems like a reasonable next bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. Given the history of challenges and successful bids, and the limited number of total digits (32), a bid of 4 8s seems plausible, but risky. I have one 7, so bidding higher on 7s is possible. However, increasing the quantity to 5 7s seems more likely to be a bluff. I will challenge the current bid as I have no 8s and believe 4 8s is a high number to realistically have in the remaining hands.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains one 7. The current bid is 2 7s. With 3 players and 24 total digits, an average of 2.4 of each digit is expected. Having one 7 in my hand makes the bid of 2 7s seem plausible, but not overwhelmingly likely. Bidding 3 5s is a safe increase based on the two 5s in my hand, and it's a higher bid than 2 7s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. My hand contains two 5s and two 7s. Bidding 3 7s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, leveraging my two 7s. Given 24 total digits, it's plausible there are at least three 7s (including my two). Challenging the current bid carries risk, as the 3 5s claim could be true if the other players have one 5. Bidding 3 7s is a safer, higher bid based on my hand's composition.
