Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The game has just started, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 31062238, which contains two 2s, two 3s, and one each of 0, 1, 6, and 8. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative. I have a total of 4 digits that appear more than once (2s and 3s), so bidding on a digit that appears frequently seems logical. I will bid on 3s since there are two of them. A bid of '3 3s' seems like a safe starting point as it is a low quantity relative to the total number of digits (48) and reflects a digit that I know appears at least twice.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid of 3 3s requires at least one additional 3 in other players' hands. With 48 total digits and an average of 4.8 3s expected across all hands, bidding 4 3s leverages my existing information and statistical likelihood. This bid increases the quantity while maintaining the same digit, adhering to the hierarchy of bids.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have one '4' in my hand. Given there are 48 digits total among all players, having at least four 4s is quite plausible. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 and raise the digit. I don't have many 4s, but I do have two 5s in my hand, so bidding 4 5s is a reasonable next step, increasing the digit while maintaining the quantity, making it a valid and believable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have 0 5s in my hand, but I do not want to challenge since I'm not confident in my ability to win. I should bid a higher quantity and digit to increase my chances of winning. I have 3 digits in my hand (7, 4, 0, 1, 9, 5 is not present, 6 is not present, 2 is not present), and the highest digit is 9. I can bid 1 9s or 2 9s, but since the current bid is 4 5s, I should aim for a higher quantity. I also have 4 digits, so I can bid 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains three 8s. The current bid is 4 9s, which requires at least four 9s across all players. Since I have no 9s and others may not have enough, challenging could be risky. Instead, I can bid 5 8s, increasing the quantity to 5 (higher than 4) and leveraging the 8s I hold. This is a valid higher bid based on my hand's composition.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. My hand is 31062238, which contains one 8. So, I have a total of 1 '8'. The total count of 8s across all players must be at least 1 and at most 6 (one from each player). The current bid of 5 8s is within the possible range but on the higher side. However, it's not impossible since there are 5 other players who could have 8s. I need to either make a higher bid or challenge. Given that I have one 8, I can reasonably believe that there could be more 8s. Bidding higher on 8s or moving to a higher digit could be a strategy. I'll choose to bid 5 9s, increasing the digit to make a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid of 5 9s requires at least 5 nines across all 6 players. With 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8. Since I have no 9s in my hand, the remaining 40 digits (from other players) have an expected count of ~4.0 nines. The probability of the total being <5 is higher than â‰¥5, making this bid slightly over the expected value and risky. Challenging is statistically favorable.

Player 1 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the round with 5 players (40 total digits). I have two 3s and two 1s in my hand. Bidding 3 3s is reasonable because: 1) I have two of them, 2) with 5 players it's likely at least one more exists, 3) it starts the bidding at a moderate level compared to the previous round's early bids of 3 3s and 4 3s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. The next valid bids must be higher than 3 4s, so I can either bid 3 5s or increase the quantity to 4 with any digit. I have two 5s in my hand, which makes bidding 3 5s a reasonable and safe increment. Bidding 3 5s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is valid and plausible given my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have 0 5s in my hand, which is the same digit as the current bid. However, I have two 6s and one 9. Since the current bid is 3 5s, I will increase the quantity to 4, as I have no 5s but can make up for it by counting my 6s and 9. This way, I increase both the quantity and digit, making a reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains three 8s. The current bid is 4 6s. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages my existing 8s, which could contribute to the total count. This maintains pressure without overextending.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid of 4 8s aligns with the statistical average of 4 occurrences per digit in 40 total digits. Since I have no 8s, challenging risks elimination if the count meets expectations. Bidding 4 9s follows the pattern of increasing digits while leveraging the same average probability, maintaining strategic pressure without overcommitting to a higher quantity.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand, and starting with a bid of 3 3s aligns with previous rounds' patterns. With 32 total digits across 4 players, this bid is conservative and leverages my existing cards. No prior bids exist in this round, so establishing a baseline bid is strategic.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have 6 and 9 in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s from Player 3. I can make a bid that increases both quantity and digit, as I have two digits that match the current digit and one other digit that I can use to increase the quantity.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand, but the total count of 6s across all players is uncertain. Bidding 4 7s is a valid higher bid since it maintains the same quantity (4) but increases the digit (7 > 6). This leverages my possession of a 7 and avoids challenging without strong evidence of the bid's invalidity.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. With 24 remaining digits across three other players, the expected number of 7s in those digits is ~2.4 (24 * 0.1). Adding my one 7 gives an expected total of ~3.4, which is below the bid of 4. Since the probability of the actual count being â‰¥4 is low, challenging is the optimal move.

Increasing the quantity to 3 but digit higher than 5 is possible. I have one 6, so bidding 3 6s is reasonable and a valid higher bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have one 7 in my hand (65045529). Since there are only 16 digits total, having at least five 7s is plausible but somewhat high. To raise the bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep quantity the same and increase the digit. The next valid bids after 5 7s are 5 8s, 5 9s, or 6 0s and above. I have no 8s or 9s in my hand, and raising the quantity to 6 seems risky without stronger evidence. Challenging might be premature since 5 7s is not unlikely with two players.
