Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first bidder and the current bid is None. I need to make a starting bid. My hand has two 8s and two 5s. A conservative starting bid is usually based on a digit you have multiple of. Bidding 2 8s is a safe start.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s, and I have one 8 in my hand. Since the bid is low and I have some evidence supporting it, I can safely increase the bid. The next valid higher bid could be 2 9s (same quantity, higher digit) or 3 0s (higher quantity, lowest digit). Bidding 2 9s is a minimal increase and reasonable given the current bid and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. There are 48 total digits across 6 players. The expected number of any digit is 48/10 = 4.8. I have one 9 in my hand (45906015). For the bid to be false, there would need to be fewer than two 9s among the other 40 digits held by the other 5 players. The expected number of 9s among those 40 digits is 40 * (1/10) = 4. Therefore, a total of three 9s is statistically very likely (expected total is 1 + 4 = 5). Challenging is too risky. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 0s. Bidding 4 0s is a valid next bid (higher quantity). This bid is plausible as I hold two 0s, requiring only two more from the remaining 40 digits, which is below the expected value of 4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 72435209, which contains one 0. The current bid is 4 0s by Player 3. With 6 players and 48 total digits, it’s possible that there are at least 4 zeros across all hands, as each player could have a few. I don’t have strong evidence to challenge this bid since my single 0 doesn’t give me much insight into the total count, and challenging carries the risk of elimination if wrong. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. I have two 2s in my hand, so bidding 4 2s feels reasonable as it increases the digit while maintaining the quantity, and it aligns with my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 3 in my hand and expect around 3–4 more among the other players’ 40 unknown digits, making at least four 3s plausible. This is the smallest valid raise over 4 2s.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:3 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected number of any digit is around 4.8 (48 / 10). A bid of 4 3s seems plausible, but not overly aggressive. I have two 8s and two 5s. Bidding 4 5s or 4 8s would be a valid higher bid based on my hand and the current bid. Bidding 4 5s is a valid increase over 4 3s (same quantity, higher digit). Bidding 4 8s is also valid. Bidding 5 of any digit would also be valid. Given I have two 5s, bidding 4 5s is a safe and reasonable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I need to make a higher bid, either by increasing the quantity or keeping the quantity at 4 but increasing the digit. I have one '5' in my hand, so bidding 4 6s is a reasonable next step as it increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity. This bid is plausible given the total of 48 digits and the progression of bids.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have no 6s in my hand. Bidding higher seems risky. I could bid 5 0s, but that feels like a stretch. Given the bidding history, it's not unreasonable to think there might not be four 6s out there. Therefore, I will challenge.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:2 - google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 2. There are 5 players and 40 total digits. The expected average count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. My hand (45906015) contains one 9. For the bid to be false, there would need to be fewer than two 9s among the remaining 32 digits held by the other 4 players. Since the expected number of 9s among those 32 digits is 3.2, challenging a bid below the average (3 vs 4) seems risky and likely to fail. I should make a higher bid. Possible higher bids start with quantity 4. My hand contains two 0s and two 5s. Bidding 4 0s is supported by my hand (holding half the bid amount) and matches the expected average count. It's also the minimum possible bid increase (raising quantity but using the lowest digit), which is strategically sound early in the round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 72435209, which contains one 0. The current bid is 4 0s by Player 3. With 5 players and 40 total digits, an average of 4 zeros across all hands is possible (0.8 zeros per player on average). However, bids have been increasing, and I only have one 0 myself. The previous round had a challenge on 4 6s with only 2 actual 6s, suggesting players might be overbidding. I could bid higher, such as 4 1s or 5 0s, but since I have no 1s, increasing the digit with the same quantity feels risky. Instead, I’ll bid 5 0s to test the waters, as it’s a small increase and still plausible given the total digits. I’m not challenging yet because 4 0s is statistically possible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I hold one 0, so Player 4’s claim of five 0s needs at least four zeros in the other 32 cards. The chance of ≥4 zeros in 32 random digits is only about 40%, so the bid is unlikely. A challenge has roughly a 60% chance to succeed and eliminate Player 4, so I should challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand and with 32 total digits the expected number of any digit is about 3.2. Bidding 4 7s leverages my two sevens and is a safe opening bid while limiting opponents’ same-quantity raises (only digits 8 and 9 beat 7).

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. A bid of 4 8s is a valid higher bid. While it's possible there are four 7s among the other three players, bidding 4 8s is a reasonable increase based on my hand and the number of remaining digits.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have three 8s in my hand. Since there are only 32 total digits, bidding much higher is risky. I can bid 5 8s, which is a safe increase, considering I have three 8s already.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s made by Player 2. I have zero 8s in my hand (45906015). This means the remaining 3 players (Player 0, Player 2, Player 5) must hold at least 5 eights among their 24 digits. The expected number of eights across all 32 digits is 3.2, and among the other 24 digits it's 2.4. A bid of 5 is significantly higher than the expectation, especially since I contribute none. While Player 0 and Player 2 both bid on 8s this round, requiring 5 out of the other 24 digits (~21%) seems unlikely enough to warrant suspicion. Making a higher bid, such as 5 9s (I only have one 9) or jumping to 6 of any digit (like 6 0s or 6 5s, where I have two each), feels too risky given the quantity jump and potential lack of support from others. Challenging the 5 8s bid seems like the safest and most strategically sound move.
