Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', which means I can make any initial bid. I should look for a digit in my hand that could be a reasonable starting point. My hand is 22748311, so I have two 1s, two 2s, and one 7, one 8, one 3, one 4. Starting with a low quantity and a relatively high digit seems strategic. I have two 2s, so bidding 2 2s seems like a reasonable starting point.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '2' in my hand. The current bid is '2 2s' by Player 0. With 5 other players, it's possible that at least one more '2' exists among their hands. However, the bid is still low, so I can safely increase the bid by raising the digit. I'll bid '2 3s', which is a higher bid than '2 2s'.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. The current bid is 2 3s, and bidding 2 4s is the smallest valid raise. Since I hold both 4s, this bid is guaranteed if challenged.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. Since I have three 5s, I can reasonably bid 3 5s, increasing the digit while maintaining the quantity. This seems like a safe and strategic bid given the information available.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 5 and two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. Bidding 3 6s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, leveraging my two 6s to support a plausible higher-digit claim.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 3 and increase the digit. Bidding 3 7s is a valid next step and reasonable given the current bid and my hand.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s made by Player 5. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than the current bid. I have the digits 2, 2, 7, 4, 8, 3, 1, 1 in my hand. Counting my digits, I have 2 2s, 2 1s, 1 3, 1 4, 1 7, and 1 8. Since I have one 7, I can try to bid higher on 7s or switch to a different digit. Bidding 4 7s seems unlikely since there's only 1 7 in my hand and 6 other players have unknown hands. However, I can bid on a different digit that I have multiple instances of or a higher digit. I have two 2s, so bidding 4 2s seems reasonable as it increases both quantity and digit compared to the previous bids and utilizes my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '2' in my hand. The current bid is '4 2s' made by Player 0. Given that there are 6 players with 8 digits each, the total possible '2s' is 48. However, the bid of 4 '2s' seems reasonable considering the number of players and the distribution. Since I have one '2', it's possible that other players have a few as well. To stay in the game, I should make a higher bid. The next logical bid would be to increase the quantity to 5 '2s'.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 5 4s is the next valid bid (same quantity, higher digit than 2s), and I only need at least three more 4s among the 40 unknown digits, which is quite likely (~76%). Other bids carry higher risk.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. Previous bids include 3 5s by me and 3 6s by Player 4. Bidding 6 9s seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit. I could challenge, but there is a non-zero chance that the bid is valid, so I should bid instead.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:3 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. My hand contains only one 9. Given 6 players each with 8 digits, the statistical probability of there being 6 9s total is low (each player would need ~1 9 on average, but 9s are only 10% of possible digits). Challenging this bid offers a reasonable chance of success if the bid is exaggerated, while the risk of elimination is balanced by the potential to remove an opponent.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: As the starting player, I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 6s and two 0s. Bidding 3 6s is reasonable because I have two, and it's likely at least one other player has a 6. This is a conservative opening bid based on my holdings.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s by Player 4. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Bidding 3 7s is a valid and reasonable next bid, as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Since I have one 7 in my hand, this bid is plausible.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s made by Player 5. I have the hand 22748311, which contains one 7. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 secret digits, there are a total of 40 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Since the bid is 3 7s, and I have one 7, I need to assess if this bid is likely or not. With 40 total digits, and assuming the worst-case scenario where all other players have no 7s, it's possible but seems unlikely that there are at least 3 7s. However, I don't have enough information to be certain. I should make a bid that is higher than 3 7s. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable as it's higher in digit value and I have an 8 in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which means there would need to be at least two more 8s among the other four players (total of 32 digits). Given that the previous round saw a challenge on a high bid (6 9s) that failed, it's risky to assume there are three 8s in total. However, I can make a safer bid by increasing the digit to 9s, which is higher than 8s, without increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. The bid of 3 9s is quite plausible (I see one 9 + expected ~3.2 more), so challenging is too risky. Raising to 4 4s is valid and likely: I only need two more 4s among the 32 unknown digits, which is probable.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 4s. Bidding 4 6s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Given that I have two 6s and there are four other players, it's plausible there are at least two more 6s in their hands, making the bid reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. My hand has one 5, one 4, one 9, one 3, one 7, and other digits, but no 6s. The last bid was 4 6s, so I must bid higher. The next higher bid can be 4 7s or more. I have one 7 in my hand, which supports bidding 4 7s. Bidding 4 7s is a reasonable escalation given my hand and the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 5. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than this. I have the digits 2, 2, 7, 4, 8, 3, 1, 1 in my hand. I see that there are already bids for higher digits (8s and 9s) with the same quantity (3), so I should aim to increase the quantity or match the digit and increase quantity. Since I have two 7s and the bid is 4 7s, I should consider if challenging is more beneficial or if I can make a higher bid. Given that I do not have enough 7s to guarantee a win with a higher quantity and that 7 is a relatively high digit, I should assess if challenging is more strategic.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', and it's my turn as Player 0. I have 8 secret digits: 22748311. I see that I have two 2s in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one '2' in my hand. The current bid is '2 2s' by Player 0. Given that there are 3 other players with 8 digits each, it's possible that there is at least one more '2' among them, making the current bid plausible. However, to avoid challenging and risking elimination, I can make a safe higher bid by increasing the digit. I have a '3' in my hand, so bidding '2 3s' is a reasonable move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid of 2 3s is very likely true (≈70% chance of ≥2 threes). I hold two 4s, so by bidding 3 4s I only need one more 4 among the 24 unknown cards (≈92% chance). This raises the quantity and uses a digit I’m strong in, restricting future raises.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains two 6s, which supports a bid of 3 6s. The current bid is 3 4s, and increasing the digit to 6s while maintaining the same quantity is a valid and cautious move. This leverages my existing 6s for credibility while keeping the bid plausible given the remaining digits.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 4. I have the hand 22748311, which contains two 2s, one 7, one 8, and other digits. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 32 total digits remaining, I should assess the likelihood of the current bid being true. Since 3 6s seems plausible but not certain, I need to consider my own hand and the bidding history. My hand does not have any 6s, so I rely on the possibility of other players having them. A bid of 4 2s seems reasonable as I have two 2s and it increases the quantity.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 4 2s, which seems high given that there are only 32 digits in total and 4 players. The bid history shows that previous challenges have been successful against high bids. Given that I only have one 2, it's unlikely that there are three more among the other three players (who have 24 digits combined). Therefore, I should challenge the bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, making it a valid higher bid. Since I already have two 6s, only one more 6 is needed in the remaining 16 digits of the other players, which is statistically likely. This balances risk and progression in the bidding.

Given that my hand has one 6 and the bid is 3 6s, I need to consider if bidding higher or challenging is optimal. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24 and there are 24 digits in total, a bid of 3 6s seems plausible but not extremely high. However, I can see that bidding 4 2s could be a reasonable strategy since I have two 2s in my hand, and increasing the quantity while choosing a digit I have seems smart. But first, I should check if challenging could be more beneficial.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains two 6s. The current bid is 2 2s. Bidding 3 6s increases the quantity from 2 to 3, which is a valid higher bid. Since I have two 6s, it's plausible there are three 6s in total if Player 0 has one. This bid is strategically reasonable without being overly risky.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 4. I have 2 2s in my hand, and I previously bid 2 2s. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 16 and there are only 2 players left, I should assess the likelihood of there being 3 or more 6s. Given that I have 8 digits and Player 4 has 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 16. I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than 3 6s. Bidding 4 2s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity, but I should also consider the challenge if the bid seems too high to be believable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand, so Player 0 would need three 2s for the bid of 4 2s to be true. However, challenging is risky since Player 0 has historically won challenges on similar bids. Bidding 4 6s is a safer move, as I have two 6s in my hand, increasing the likelihood that the total count meets the bid.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 4. My hand contains two 2s. Given that the total number of digits remaining is 16 and there are only 2 players left, I should consider the feasibility of the current bid and my own hand strength. Since my previous bid of 4 2s was valid and I have two 2s, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. I will bid 5 2s as it is a straightforward increase in quantity based on my hand.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:3 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. My hand contains only one 2, so Player 0 would need four 2s to meet the bid. The probability of Player 0 having four 2s in their 8-digit hand is extremely low (~0.46% assuming random digits). Challenging this bid is statistically favorable, as the actual count is almost certainly less than 5.
