Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player to bid, I need to establish a reasonable starting bid. My hand contains two 7s and two 2s. Bidding 3 7s is a conservative opening move, leveraging my existing 7s while allowing room for other players to potentially add more 7s. This bid is low enough to be plausible but leaves room for escalation.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid since the digit is higher. This leverages my hand's 9s and increases the digit value without needing to guess others' holdings.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding 4 9s is too risky as it's a high quantity and I have no information to support it. I could bid a lower quantity on a digit I have, but Player 1's bid of 3 9s already seems high. Given the total digits remaining (48) and the number of players (6), 3 9s represents a significant proportion of the total possible 9s (maximum 6). I will challenge the bid, as it seems unlikely someone has that many 9s.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains three 6s. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid that reflects my highest count. Bidding 3 6s is logical as it matches the quantity of 6s I hold, and it's a valid starting point.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. To reach a total of three 8s, only one more is needed among the other 32 unseen digits – a roughly 96% chance. Bidding 3 8s is a safe increase over 3 6s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. I could challenge, but that seems risky. I have two 9s in my hand, so I can bid 4 9s, increasing both the quantity and the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. While 4 9s is the average expected count across 40 digits, the previous round's outcome (5 9s) suggests there might be a higher concentration of 9s among the remaining players. Challenging feels risky given this history. My hand contains two 5s. Bidding 5 5s is a valid higher bid (quantity 5 is greater than quantity 4) and is supported by my hand, as I only need 3 more 5s among the remaining 32 digits (expected average is 3.2), making it a reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. The current bid is 5 5s. Bidding 5 7s increases the digit while keeping the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. Since I have two 7s, this bid aligns with my hand and leverages the possibility that other players have additional 7s, making it more plausible than challenging an uncertain count.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. My hand contains three 6s, and bidding 6 6s increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 6s while adhering to the rules of increasing quantity.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have zero 6s in my hand, so all six 6s must be in the other 32 unknown digits. The expected count there is only 3.2 and the chance of seeing six or more is under 15%. It’s very unlikely the bid of 6 6s is true, so I should challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand and expect about 2.4 more among the other 24 digits, giving over a 90% chance of at least three 8s total. Opening with 3 8s is a safe, reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that there are 32 digits remaining and 4 players, it's possible that there are at least 3 8s in total. However, bidding higher seems risky without more information. Challenging might be safer, but it's risky because there could indeed be 3 8s. A conservative bid like 4 0s could be a strategic move, as there are likely to be at least four 0s among the remaining digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. My hand contains two 7s. With 32 total digits remaining, the expected number of 7s is 3.2. Having two 7s in my hand means I need at least two more 7s from the remaining 24 digits for a bid of 4 7s to be true. This is a statistically reasonable expectation. Bidding 4 7s is a valid higher bid than 4 0s (same quantity, higher digit) and is well-supported by my hand. Challenging 4 0s is less appealing as 4 is not an extremely high bid relative to the total digits, and I hold one 0 myself.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 5 7s increases the quantity while maintaining the same digit, which is plausible if other players have at least three 7s. Challenging the 4 7s bid risks elimination if the actual count is four or more, which is likely given the expected distribution of digits. Bidding 5 7s is a safer move to continue the game.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand and there are only 24 unknown digits; the expected number of additional 7s is about 2.4, making a total of five 7s unlikely (around a 25–30% chance). Challenging gives me a much higher chance to win.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make a reasonable opening bid. My hand contains two 7s, so bidding 3 7s is plausible. With two 7s in my hand, there only needs to be one more in the remaining 16 digits (across two players) to make the bid true. This is a conservative and logical starting point that balances my hand's composition with the total digits available.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. Given that there are only 24 digits remaining across 3 players, it's plausible that there could be 3 7s. However, I have no information on the other players' hands, so challenging could be risky. Bidding 4 7s seems like a reasonable and safe move, increasing the quantity of the current bid's digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains two 7s. The current bid is 4 7s. There are 24 total digits among 3 players. The expected number of 7s is around 24/10 = 2.4. Adding my two 7s, the expected total is 4.4. The bid of 4 7s is very close to the expected value. Furthermore, the previous round's challenge on 5 7s revealed an actual count of 6 7s, suggesting 7s are relatively common among the remaining players. Challenging 4 7s seems risky given this history and the expected value. Bidding higher is the better option. Bidding 5 7s is a valid higher bid based on my hand and the recent game history.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have two 7s in my hand. The other two players have 16 digits total. The expected number of 7s in 16 digits is 1.6, making a total of ~3.6. The bid of 5 is significantly higher than this expectation. Challenging is likely to succeed if the bid is false, which is probable given the low expected count.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I must make the first bid of this round. I have two 5s and two 7s in my hand. With a total of 16 digits between the two players, a bid of 3 of a digit is a reasonable starting point, implying the other player has at least one of that digit. Bidding 3 5s or 3 7s are both plausible opening moves based on my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 9s and one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 3 5s. Since I have a 5, it's possible that there are at least 3 5s in total. However, bidding 4 5s is risky because I only have one 5. Instead, I should bid 4 9s, increasing both the quantity and the digit based on my hand. This bid is more secure because I have two 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, made by Player 4. There are a total of 16 digits remaining (8 in my hand, 8 in Player 4's hand). My hand contains one 9. For the bid of 4 9s to be true, Player 4 must have at least 3 nines in their 8 digits. The probability of a player having 3 or more of a specific digit in 8 random digits is quite low (calculated to be around 3.8%). This makes the bid of 4 9s seem highly unlikely to be true. Challenging this bid gives me a high probability of winning (around 96.2% chance that Player 4 has less than 3 nines). Bidding higher would require bidding at least 5 of any digit. Based on my hand and the low number of remaining digits, bidding 5 of any digit would also be a significant bluff and likely to be challenged and lost. Therefore, challenging the current bid is the most favorable strategic move.
