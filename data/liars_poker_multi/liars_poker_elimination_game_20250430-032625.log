Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the opening bidder I want a safe yet assertive bid based on a digit I hold multiple times. I have two 9s. Statistically, with 40 unknown digits left, the expected number of additional 9s is about 4, and the chance there are at least two more (giving a total of 4) is over 90%. Choosing the highest digit (9) also forces the next player to raise the quantity rather than just the digit. Therefore, bidding 4 9s is both likely to be valid and strategically constrains subsequent bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have four 1s in my hand. The average total for any digit across all players is 4.8, making a bid of 5 1s plausible. Since 4 9s is below average and challenging carries risk, raising on 1s leverages my visible strength in that digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 6s and two 5s in my hand. Player 1 bid 5 1s. Since I have no 1s, I can't make a bid based on that digit. Bidding 6 5s seems reasonable, increasing the digit and quantity slightly beyond the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s. My hand contains zero 5s, making it difficult to support a higher bid on 5s. However, my hand contains two 8s. Bidding 6 8s is a valid move as it maintains the quantity while increasing the digit, and it is supported by my hand having two 8s. This seems more strategically sound than challenging 6 5s at this point, as the bid is not excessively high given 48 total digits.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. My hand is 75356375, which contains no 8s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I have two 5s and no 8s, and the total count of 8s is already bid at 6, I should consider the likelihood of the total count being higher. Bidding 7 8s seems plausible as it increases the quantity. Alternatively, bidding 6 9s is also valid as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit. Given that there's at least one 9 in the initial bid by Player 0 (4 9s), and my hand has no 9s but has other digits, I can reasonably bid 6 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid of 6 9s is quite plausible (I have 2, and probability that at least 4 more exist among the other 40 is over 50%), so challenging is likely to fail. I must raise to quantity 7. I hold two 2s, so bidding 7 2s uses a digit I have and is the minimal valid increase.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:4 - o3-2025-04-16) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I hold two 9s (9,9) in my hand. Challenging the current bid of 7 2s is risky because Player 5 is unlikely to have bid that high without at least a couple of 2s; my chance of winning a challenge is probably under 40%. Instead, I can legally outbid by keeping the quantity at 7 but moving to a higher digit. With my two 9s already known, we need five more 9s among the 40 unknown digits; that has roughly a 37% probability, which is acceptable at this stage and comparable to the plausibility of the present bid. Choosing the top digit (9) also forces the next player to raise the quantity to 8 or more, giving me breathing room. Therefore I will bid 7 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand. With 48 total digits across 6 players, the expected count for any digit (including 9s) is 4.8. The bid of 7 9s requires exceeding this expectation by a significant margin. Player 0's aggressive jump from 4 9s to 7 9s suggests bluffing, especially since earlier bids focused on lower digits (1s, 5s, 8s). Challenging is statistically favorable because the actual count is likely below 7.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have four 1s in my hand. With 40 total digits remaining and an expected average of ~7 total 1s across all hands (including mine), bidding 6 1s leverages my strong holding while leaving room for cautious overbidding by others. This bid is statistically likely to be true and forces opponents to either escalate or challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s. I have two 6s in my hand. Since 6 is higher than 1, I can safely bid 6 6s. This bid is higher than the current bid because it has the same quantity but a higher digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. With 40 total digits remaining, the average expected count for any digit is 4. A bid of 6 is significantly above average expectation. My hand contains zero 6s, which makes challenging tempting as I have no reason to believe the bid is true. However, challenging is risky if Player 2 happens to hold multiple 6s. My hand contains two 8s, making 8s my strongest digit. Bidding 6 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is plausible given my hand, as the expected total count for 8s (including my two) is 5.2. Bidding 6 8s leverages my hand strength and passes the turn, which is safer than challenging the 6 6s bid without information.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I have the hand 75356375, which contains two 8s (though I don't reveal this). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since my hand doesn't have any digits higher than 8 in significant amounts, I'll consider increasing the quantity or keeping the same quantity with a higher digit, but since there's no higher digit than 8, I'll have to increase the quantity. Bidding 7 8s is a reasonable next step as it increases the quantity. However, I should also consider the total count and the likelihood of the bid being true. With 40 total digits and the bid being 6 8s, it's plausible that there are at least 7 8s. I will bid 7 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, so for the bid of 7 8s to be true there must be at least five 8s among the other 32 digits. Even under a uniform distribution that’s only about a 20–25% chance. Any higher bid would be even less plausible. It's more likely this bid is a bluff, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: It’s the opening bid and I hold two 9s. With 24 other cards among three players, the expected number of 9s is about 2.4, so needing just one more for a total of three is very likely (~91%). Starting with 3 9s also forces any raise to increase the quantity, making it a strong opener.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have four 1s in my hand (digits: 0,1,1,4,5,1,1,8). Bidding 4 1s leverages my strong holding of 1s and follows the rule that any quantity increase over 3 is a valid higher bid. Since 1s are already concentrated in my hand, it's a conservative play to push the bidding toward a digit I can confidently support.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have two 6s in my hand. Given the bidding history, it's reasonable to assume that there are likely at least 4 6s among all players' hands. Bidding 5 6s increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 2. My hand is 84273089, which contains two 8s and no 6s. Bidding 5 8s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and leverages the strength of my hand. Challenging 5 6s is risky, as 5 of a digit is not exceptionally high given 32 total digits, and Player 2 might have a few 6s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I hold two 8s and need at least three more in the 24 unknown cards for the bid of 5 8s to be correct. The probability of that is roughly 43%, so challenging gives me about a 56% chance to win and eliminate Player 3.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have four 1s in my hand. Bidding 5 1s is a logical next step since it's likely there's at least one more 1 in the other players' hands, making this bid plausible. This bid increases the quantity over the current bid of 4 8s.

Player 2 Reasoning: Given that the last challenge was successful against a bid of 5 1s and we have only 16 digits remaining, it's likely that high quantities of any digit are less common. However, I have two 6s in my hand, and the last successful bid was 5 6s. Bidding 6 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity based on my hand and the previous bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s made by Player 2. There are a total of 16 digits across both hands. I have zero 6s in my hand (84273089). This means for the bid to be true, Player 2 must have at least six 6s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having 6 or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is extremely low (calculated as P(X>=6) for B(8, 0.1) which is approximately 0.0023%). Given the extremely low probability, it is highly likely that Player 2 does not have six or more 6s. Challenging is the optimal move as the bid is very likely false.
