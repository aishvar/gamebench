Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since there's no current bid and I have multiple 8s in my hand, I should start with a reasonable bid. I have 3 eights, so it's likely that there are at least 6 eights across 6 players. A bid of 6 8s seems like a good starting point.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. My hand contains no 8s, and the expected number of 8s in 48 digits is 4.8. A bid of 6 8s is slightly above average, but not impossible. However, challenging a bid that is marginally above the expected value could be strategic if the likelihood of it being false is higher. Given the uncertainty and the risk of a higher bid potentially being even less likely, challenging is the optimal choice.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to establish a starting bid. My hand contains three 4s, making 4 a reasonable digit to base my bid on. Bidding 4 4s is a moderate opening that accounts for my own digits and allows for plausible existence of one more 4 in the remaining hands. This is a conservative yet strategic starting point given the total digits available.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:0 - o3-2025-04-16) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 7s. To beat the current bid of 4 4s I can keep the quantity at 4 but raise the digit. Bidding 4 7s uses my two known 7s and only needs two more among the remaining 32 unseen digits. Randomly, 0.1 of each unknown digit should be a 7, so the chance of at least two more 7s is roughly 85%, making this bid much safer than challenging (which would win only about 60% of the time). Therefore raising to 4 7s is the prudent play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. I could bid 5 0s, which is a valid higher bid. However, since the total number of digits is now 40, bidding 4 8s also seems reasonable. I'll bid 5 0s to be conservative.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have no zeros in my hand. With 40 total digits and an expected 4 zeros, the probability of at least five zeros is under 10%, making this bid very unlikely. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. With 24 unknown digits and p=0.1, the probability of at least two more 4s is about 71%, making 4 4s a safe opening bid that also forces opponents to raise to 4 5s or higher or jump to 5 of a digit. This locks the bid in a strong position.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s, and I have the digits 2, 2, 4, 0, 1, 1, 5, 6. Counting my own hand, I have two 4s. Since the total digits are 32, and I only have at most 2 4s, the likelihood that the total count of 4s across all hands exceeds 4 is very low. Challenging now would be a smart move, given the low probability that there are 5 or more 4s in total.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 4s in my hand. With 24 total digits, the expected count per digit is about 2.4, so opening with 2 4s is a safe bid I can back up.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. The current bid is 2 4s, which is already met. Bidding 3 4s increases the quantity while maintaining the same digit, making it a valid and cautious move. Since I hold three 4s, this bid is likely true, and challenging would be unwise as the current bid is safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 7s in my hand. That means only one more 7 is needed among the 16 unknown digits to make a total of three, which has roughly an 80% chance of being true. I am less comfortable challenging 3 4s because Player 4 earlier opened with 2 4s, hinting that several 4s may actually be in play. Raising the digit while keeping the quantity lets me make a stronger bid backed by my own cards and avoids the riskier challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have zero 7s in my hand. The bid of 3 7s requires all 3 to be in the other 16 cards, which has only about a 21% chance of being true. This seems unlikely, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I must place the first bid of the round. The safest opening bid is one that is already guaranteed true from my own hand so that I can never lose to an immediate challenge. I have two 7s in my eight cards (hand: 33975027). Therefore a bid of "2 7s" is certainly correct. This obliges Player 1 either to raise the quantity or switch to a higher digit, giving me room to evaluate their next move, while exposing me to no risk if they decide to challenge straight away.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 4s in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s. Bidding 3 4s increases the quantity and is supported by my hand. Even if Player 2 has no 4s, the total count (3) meets the bid, making this a safe and valid move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 7s (77) and zero 4s. Player 1 has repeatedly bid high counts of 4s, so it’s very plausible they actually have three or more 4s. Challenging their bid of 3 4s would probably lose. Instead, I’ll raise by keeping the quantity at three but moving the digit to 7, which I’m already strong in. I only need Player 1 to have a single 7 for the bid to be correct (about a 57 % chance), which is far better than the odds of winning a challenge. Therefore, bidding 3 7s is the safer and stronger play.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:2 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7 in my hand. For the bid to be true, Player 2 must have at least two 7s. Given that digits are randomly distributed, the probability of Player 2 having two or more 7s in their 8-digit hand is approximately 18.7%. This is relatively low, making the bid unlikely. Challenging offers a higher chance of success based on statistical probability.
