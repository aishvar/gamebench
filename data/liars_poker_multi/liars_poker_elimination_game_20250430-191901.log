Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', which means I can make any valid bid as the first player. I have the digits 8, 1, 3, 5, 0, 8, 7, 8 in my hand. The digit '8' appears three times. Starting with a bid of '3 8s' seems reasonable and allows me to showcase a strong opening bid based on my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand and no 8s. The current bid is 3 8s. Bidding 3 9s maintains the same quantity but increases the digit, which is a valid higher bid. Given the expected distribution of digits (average ~4.8 8s total), 3 8s is likely true, so challenging risks elimination. Bidding 3 9s leverages my two 9s and is more defensible since even with minimal 9s from others, the total would meet the bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. Challenging 3 9s is risky—the chance of ≥3 nines among 40 unknown digits is only about 23% that it’s wrong. Instead, bidding 4 0s is reasonable: I hold 2 zeros and expect about 4 more among the other 40 cards, making at least two additional zeros quite likely.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s by Player 2. I must bid higher either by increasing the quantity or the digit. I have one '1', one '4', one '3', one '5', one '8', one '6', and one '3' in my hand. Bidding 4 1s is a minimal increase in digit and quantity remains the same, but 4 1s is a valid higher bid than 4 0s. This is reasonable given the current bid and my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '4 1s' and decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge. Looking at my hand (17513925), I have one '1' digit. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each (48 total digits), and I know I have one '1', there could be up to 7 more '1's among the other players. The current bid of 4 1s seems reasonable and not worth challenging. For my bid, I can either increase the quantity to 5 or keep the quantity at 4 but increase the digit. Since I have two '5's in my hand, bidding '5 1s' or '4 5s' both seem reasonable. I'll go with '5 1s' since it's possible there are more than 4 '1's total.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. With my hand containing 0 1s and the expected total number of 1s across all 48 digits being approximately 4.8 (10% probability per digit), the bid of 5 1s is statistically unlikely to be valid. Challenging this bid is a calculated risk based on probability and the absence of 1s in my own hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Starting a new round as the first bidder gives me flexibility. In my hand, I have two 1s, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 7, and one 9. Since I have two 1s, I could start with a bid on 1s. However, I should be strategic and not reveal too much about my hand immediately. Looking at the previous round, there were at least 6 1s total, but with one player eliminated, some of those 1s might be gone. A conservative opening bid would be something like 3 1s or 4 1s. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I don't have much of to mislead others. Since I have one 5, bidding 3 5s would suggest I might have more 5s than I actually do. This seems like a reasonable opening strategy.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s made by Player 4. I have the digits 8, 1, 3, 5, 0, 8, 7, 8 in my hand, which includes one 5. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, the total number of digits is 40. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Since I have one 5 and there are 4 other players, it's possible that the total count of 5s could be higher than 3. However, bidding a quantity that seems reasonable and higher than the current bid is a strategic move. I will bid 4 8s because I have three 8s in my hand and it's a higher digit than 5, making it a potentially strong bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which I cannot support since I have no 8s. Bidding 5 9s increases the quantity and uses a digit I have, which may be plausible given the total digits remaining. Challenging the current bid is risky because the expected number of 8s in the remaining 40 digits is 4, making the bid potentially valid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand and there are only 32 unknown digits. Even if the unknowns follow the 1-in-10 distribution, the probability of seeing at least five 9s is only around 21%, making the current bid of 5 9s highly unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With 24 other digits among the three opponents and an expected 2.4 additional 8s, there’s about a 92% chance of at least one more 8, making a total of three 8s very plausible. Starting with 3 8s also positions me strongly for subsequent raises.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s, and I must make a higher bid. My hand contains one 8, so bidding slightly higher is reasonable. The next valid higher bids would be either 3 9s or 4 0s. Since 3 9s is the next higher digit with the same quantity, I choose to bid 3 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge Player 3's bid of 3 9s or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (17513925), I have one 9. This means there need to be at least 2 more 9s among the other 24 digits held by the three other players for the bid to be valid. That's quite possible, requiring only about 8.3% of the remaining digits to be 9s. Given that I've seen Player 3 bid conservatively (moving from 3 8s to 3 9s), they likely have at least one 9 in their hand. So challenging would be risky. For my bid, I could go to 4 0s, 4 1s, or 4 any higher digit. I have two 1s in my hand, which gives me more confidence in bidding 4 1s. This is a reasonable increase that's supported by my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s made by Player 4. I have 8 secret digits: 81350878. I see that I have one 8 and two 1s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 32 total digits remaining, I should consider the likelihood of there being at least 4 1s across all players' hands. Since I only have 2 1s and there are 3 other players, it's possible but I need to assess if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. I can see that bidding 5 8s would be a valid higher bid since 5 is higher than 4 and 8 is higher than 1.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. For Player 0’s bid of 5 8s to be true, the other 24 digits must contain at least three more 8s. The expected number of 8s in 24 random digits is only 2.4, and the probability of finding three or more is under 45%. Since the claim is more likely false than true, I should challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current round has just started with 3 active players: Player 0, Player 3, and Player 4. I, Player 0, have the hand 81350878. Since there are no bids yet, I can make the first bid. I see that I have three 8s in my hand. Given that there are 24 total digits and 3 players, it's plausible that other players might have digits that could add to a reasonable bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have one '8' in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since the current bid is 3 8s, the next valid bids could be 3 9s or 4 0s and above. I don't have any 9s in my hand, but I have one '1' and one '3', so bidding 4 1s or higher might be risky without more information. Bidding 3 9s is the minimal increase and might be a safer move given the limited information and my hand. Challenging 3 8s seems premature because 3 eights across 24 digits is plausible. Therefore, I will bid 3 9s.

Player 4 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (17513925), I have one 9, which means there are at least that many 9s in play. Player 3 has bid 3 9s, suggesting they might have at least 2 more 9s in their hand. This is plausible. I could challenge, but with only one 9 in my hand, it's quite possible that Player 0 and Player 3 together have at least 2 more 9s, making the total at least 3. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, one 3, one 5, one 7, and one 9. I could bid 4 1s based on my two 1s, but from previous rounds, I know Player 3 bid 4 1s before, suggesting they might have 1s as well. A safer option would be to bid 4 2s or 4 3s. I have one 3 in my hand, and 3s haven't been mentioned in previous bids, so 4 3s seems reasonable.

Given that there are 24 total digits remaining and 3 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. My hand contains two 8s. I can increase the quantity or the digit.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I must bid higher either by quantity or by digit if quantity is the same. I have one '8' in my hand, which supports the plausibility of 8s being common. However, bidding 5 0s or higher quantity is a big jump and risky. Bidding 4 9s is the smallest valid increase and reasonable since I have one 9 in my hand. Challenging now seems premature as 4 8s is not an extreme bid given the total of 24 digits. Therefore, I will bid 4 9s to maintain pressure and keep the bidding going.

Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of 4 9s and decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge. Looking at my hand (17513925), I have 1 nine. For there to be at least 4 nines total, Players 0 and 3 would need to have at least 3 nines between them, which is possible but not guaranteed. Given that there are 24 total digits and 3 active players with 8 digits each, the average frequency of each digit is 2.4. So a bid of 4 9s is slightly above average but not unreasonable. I could challenge, but it's risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have 2 ones and 2 fives, which gives me some confidence. I'll bid 5 1s, which is higher than 4 9s and I know I have 2 ones already.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s made by Player 4. I have 8 secret digits: 81350878. I see that I have three 8s and two 1s. Given that there are only 24 digits in total and three players, I should assess the likelihood of there being 5 or more 1s. Since I only have two 1s and there are two other players, it's possible but not certain that the total count of 1s is 5 or more. However, I notice that bidding a higher quantity or digit is required. I can see that 5 1s is a relatively high bid given the total number of digits remaining (24) and the number of players (3). I have a strong hand with multiple 8s, which could be used to make a credible bid. Bidding 6 8s seems too high as it exceeds the total possible digits for any single number (24). Therefore, I will make a conservative bid that is higher than 5 1s, considering my hand strength.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s, made by Player 0. I have one '0' in my hand, so there must be at least 5 more '0's among the other players' hands for this bid to be valid. Given the rarity of zeros and the previous bids focusing on other digits, 6 zeros in total is quite high but not impossible. I need to raise the bid. The next higher bid must be either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. I can bid 7 0s or 6 1s. I have one '1' in my hand, so bidding 6 1s is plausible. However, bidding 7 0s is riskier but more aggressive. I will bid 6 1s to keep the bid reasonable and increase the digit, leveraging my single '1' to support the bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. My hand contains 17513925, which has one 1. Player 3 has bid 6 1s, meaning they believe there are at least 6 ones among all players. Since I have one 1, that means there would need to be 5 more 1s between the other two players. Each player has 8 digits, so it's possible but not guaranteed. Looking at the history, I previously bid 5 1s, and when challenged by Player 5, the actual count was 6 - which confirms there were 6 ones in the previous round with more players. However, now we have fewer players, so the count of 1s has likely decreased. Given that I only have one 1 in my hand, it seems risky to assume there are still 6 ones total. I could bid 6 2s or higher, but I think challenging is the better option here since I have direct evidence that the count of 1s is likely lower now than in previous rounds.

Player 4 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding in this final round against Player 0. Looking at my hand (17513925), I have two 1s, one 3, one 5, one 7, one 9, and two 2s. Since I have two 1s, that's a good digit to start with. In a two-player game with 16 total digits, a conservative opening bid would be to claim there are 3 1s total (my 2 plus expecting at least 1 from my opponent). This is a reasonable starting bid that doesn't overcommit.

My hand does not strongly support a bid higher than 3 1s without more information, but I can try to make a conservative bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge Player 0's bid of 4 8s. Looking at my hand (17513925), I have one 8. With only 16 total digits in play (8 in my hand and 8 in Player 0's hand), Player 0 would need to have at least 3 more 8s in their hand to make their bid valid. While this is possible, it's somewhat unlikely. However, I could make a higher bid. Since I have two 1s and one 9 in my hand, I could bid 4 9s (same quantity but higher digit) or 5 1s (higher quantity). Given that I've previously shown interest in 1s (bidding 3 1s and 5 1s in earlier rounds), bidding 5 1s might be more credible. I'll go with a higher bid rather than challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s made by Player 4. I have 2 1s in my hand, and since there are only 16 digits in total for both players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. Given that Player 4 has 8 secret digits and I have 2 1s, the total count of 1s could be at most 10 (if Player 4 has 8 1s). However, bidding 6 1s seems reasonable as it accounts for my 2 1s and assumes Player 4 has 4 1s, which is plausible. But I should consider if challenging is more strategic.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. Looking at my hand (17513925), I have one 1 digit. The current bid is 6 1s made by Player 0. For this to be true, Player 0 would need to have 5 1s in their hand, since I only have 1. While this is possible, it seems unlikely that Player 0 would have such a concentration of 1s. In the previous round, I successfully challenged Player 3's bid of 6 1s when there were 24 total digits, and the actual count was 5. Now with fewer digits (16 total), Player 0 is making the exact same bid. Additionally, Player 0's bidding pattern has focused on 8s in previous rounds, suggesting they might be stronger in 8s than 1s. Given I only have one 1, and the historical evidence suggests 6 1s is likely an overestimate, challenging is the best move.
