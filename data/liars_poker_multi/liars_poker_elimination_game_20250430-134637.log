Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: This is the first bid of the game, and I need to start with something reasonable. Looking at my hand (75396129), I have one 1, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 7, and one 9. I don't have any 0s, 4s, or 8s. Since I have one 9, and there are 6 players with 8 digits each (48 total digits), I can estimate that there might be around 4-5 9s total (1/10 of 48 is approximately 4.8). Starting with a conservative bid based on a digit I actually have in my hand seems wise. I'll bid 4 9s, which is reasonable and gives me room to maneuver in future rounds.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, the maximum possible 9s is 48, but the probability of having at least 4 9s across all hands is low given that I have none. Challenging seems like the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I'm starting this round, so I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand (75396129), I have one 9, one 7, one 5, one 3, one 6, one 1, one 2, and no 0s, 4s, or 8s. Since I have one 9 in my hand, and there are 5 players with 8 digits each (40 total digits), I can reasonably expect there to be several more 9s among other players. In the previous round, I bid 4 9s and the actual count was 5, which suggests 9s are somewhat common. A conservative opening bid would be 3 9s, which leaves room for escalation while being likely to be true based on my hand and previous experience.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Given the previous round where a bid of 4 9s was successful (there were 5 9s total), 3 9s is plausible. However, considering I have no 9s and the total number of digits is now 40, a higher bid on a different digit is safer. I have three 7s. Bidding 4 7s increases the quantity and is a reasonable move based on my hand. It's less risky than bidding higher on 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 2. I have 8 secret digits in my hand: 69127587. I see that I have one 7 and one 9. Given that Player 0 previously bid 3 9s, and I have one 9, there could be at least 2 nines in total. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should consider the likelihood of the current bid being true. With 5 active players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in total. If I bid higher, I must ensure my bid is reasonable. Bidding 5 8s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and uses a digit I have in my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains two 4s and two 5s. Since the current bid is None, I need to start with a valid bid. Bidding 3 4s is reasonable because I have two 4s, and it's plausible others have at least one more, making the total at least three. This bid is higher than None and leverages my hand's composition.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 59208840, which contains two 4s (positions 0 and 7). The current bid is 3 4s. With 32 digits in play and only needing to beat a bid of 3 4s, it is very likely that there are at least 3 4s among all hands. Challenging now would be risky. I can safely raise the bid to 3 5s, since I have one 5 in my hand and 5s are as likely as 4s across all hands, and this keeps the quantity low while advancing the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (75396129), I have one 5. The current bid is 3 5s from Player 5. With 4 active players having 8 digits each, there are 32 total digits in play. For there to be at least 3 5s, the other players combined need to have at least 2 more 5s, which is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's a risky move since the bid is quite reasonable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have one 9 in my hand, and I previously won a challenge when I bid 4 9s (actual count was 5), suggesting 9s might be common. I'll bid 3 6s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit, which is a valid higher bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have zero 6s in my hand. I have three 7s. Bidding 4 7s increases the quantity and is a reasonable bid given my hand. Bidding higher digits seems risky as I don't have many of them. Challenging seems too early, as 3 6s isn't exceptionally high given 32 total digits.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand has no 7s, and given previous overbidding (e.g., 5 8s), it's likely the actual count of 7s is less than 4. Challenging this bid is a strategic move to eliminate the bidder if the bid is false.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is None, meaning I can bid anything. I have three 7s in my hand. A bid of 4 7s seems reasonable as a starting bid, leveraging my hand. It's a relatively safe bid given the small number of players remaining and the total digits available.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 59208840, which contains the following digits: 5, 9, 2, 0, 8, 8, 4, 0. There are no 7s in my hand. With 3 players and 8 digits each, there are 24 digits in total. The current bid is 4 7s. Statistically, each digit appears about 2.4 times on average. While 4 7s is slightly above average, it is not implausible, especially since I have none, meaning the other two players could have 2 each. Given the recent history where a challenge on a 4-quantity bid failed (actual count was 4), it's risky to challenge here. The best move is to make a minimal higher bid. I have two 0s, so I can bid 4 8s (since I have two 8s), but 4 8s is not a higher bid than 4 7s. Instead, I should bid 4 8s, which is the next valid bid and supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of 4 8s. Looking at my hand (75396129), I have zero 8s. There are 24 total digits in play (8 digits per player × 3 players). For there to be at least 4 8s total, the other two players would need to have at least 4 8s between them. Since I have 0 8s, and each player has 8 random digits, it's certainly possible that the other players could have 4 or more 8s combined. However, the probability isn't extremely high. The expected number of 8s between the other two players would be 1.6 (2 players × 8 digits × 1/10 probability of an 8). Since 4 is significantly higher than this expectation and I have zero 8s myself, I think challenging is the better option here.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I'm starting a new round with Player 2, and each of us has 8 digits. Looking at my hand (75396129), I have one 9, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 7, and no 0s, 4s, or 8s. Since I'm starting the bidding, I should make a strategic first bid. I know exactly what I have, but I don't know what Player 2 has. A conservative approach would be to bid based on what I can see in my hand. I have one 9, so bidding '1 9s' would be safe but too conservative. I have one 1, so bidding '2 1s' assumes Player 2 has at least one 1, which is reasonable with 8 random digits. I could also bid on digits I don't have, assuming Player 2 might have some. Given that I have one 7 in my hand, and 7 is a fairly common digit, I'll bid '2 7s', assuming Player 2 has at least one 7 as well.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand (75396129). Player 2 has bid that there are 3 7s total between our hands. Since I have 1, that means Player 2 would need to have at least 2 7s in their hand for this bid to be valid. While this is possible, it's not guaranteed. However, I don't want to challenge yet as the bid is still relatively low (3 out of 16 possible digits). I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 9, so I could confidently bid 3 9s. This maintains the same quantity but increases the digit value, making it a valid higher bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Player 0 has already bid 2 7s and 3 9s, and I previously bid 3 7s. Given the history of challenges and wins, and the fact that there are only 16 digits total, a bid of 3 9s seems potentially risky for Player 0. I have two 7s, so bidding higher on 7s is not advantageous. I have one 8, so I can bid 4 8s, which is a reasonable increase from 3 9s. Alternatively, I could challenge, but Player 0 has shown a willingness to bid aggressively. Bidding 4 8s is more likely to succeed than challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge Player 2's bid of 4 8s. Looking at my hand (75396129), I have only one 8. For Player 2's bid to be valid, they would need to have at least three 8s in their hand. With 8 digits in their hand, it's possible but not highly probable. The probability of having exactly 3 or more 8s in 8 random digits is relatively low. Given that I've seen Player 2 make accurate bids in previous rounds (their bid of 4 7s was challenged and proven correct), I should be cautious. However, I could make a higher bid of 4 9s since I have one 9 in my hand, or 5 7s since I have two 7s. Since I have more 7s than 9s, bidding 5 7s seems safer. But given the limited total digits (16), I think challenging is the better option here, as 4 8s requires Player 2 to have at least 3 8s, which is a significant portion of their hand.
