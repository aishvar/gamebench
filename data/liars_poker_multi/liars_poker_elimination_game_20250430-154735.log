Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. With 48 total digits, there are on average about 4.8 sevens overall, so only one more among the other 40 cards is needed to make three sevens. Bidding 3 7s is a safe, reasonable opening bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. Since the current bid is 3 7s, and I have only one 7, it's unlikely that there are 3 7s in total across all hands. Challenging seems like a good move.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. With 40 total digits in play, the expected count for any digit is about 4. Opening with 3 7s leverages my strong holding while staying below the statistical average, making it a safe initial bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 14506512, which contains no 7s. The current bid by Player 0 is 3 7s across all 40 digits in play among 5 players. Given that I have no 7s in my 8 digits, the likelihood of there being at least 3 7s in the remaining 32 digits is possible but not guaranteed. However, since this is early in the round and Player 0 previously won a challenge on the same bid of 3 7s when there were more digits in play (48 total, actual count was 4), it suggests they might have some 7s or confidence in the count. Challenging now carries risk, as the actual count could still be 3 or more. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid to keep the game moving and test the waters. I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding 4 5s feels somewhat safe, though it’s a stretch. Alternatively, I could bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. I’ll go with 3 8s, as it’s a minimal increase from 3 7s and doesn’t overcommit on quantity while I gauge other players’ reactions.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 2. I have 3 digits that are 8s in my hand (from 12442334). Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total number of digits is 40. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Since my hand alone can fulfill the current bid of 3 8s, and considering that other players could also have 8s, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. However, challenging seems risky given that 3 8s could easily exist. I will bid higher with a reasonable guess: 4 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s, which means there are at least four 8s among all players' hands. I have no 8s in my hand (51656337), so I cannot confidently support this bid. However, the bid is not extremely high given there are 40 digits in total. I need to raise the bid with a higher quantity or the same quantity but a higher digit. Since 8 is the digit in the current bid, I can bid 4 9s to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This bid is plausible because 9 is the highest digit, and bidding 5 of any digit might be too risky without any supporting digits in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding higher in quantity is risky as it increases the chance of being challenged and losing. Bidding on a different digit is a safer option. I have two 6s. Bidding 5 6s is a reasonable increase, as it's higher than 4 9s and based on cards I hold. Bidding 4 of anything higher than 9 is impossible. A challenge is risky as Player 4 could have multiple 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have only one 6 in my hand, so the other 32 unknown digits must contain at least 4 more sixes to meet the bid of 5. For a Binomial(32,0.1) distribution, P(X≥4)≈39.8%, which is below even odds. The bid seems unlikely, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is None, meaning I can bid anything. I have two 6s in my hand. A conservative bid would be 3 6s, but given the history of escalating bids, and the fact that there are 32 total digits remaining, I'll bid 4 6s. This is a reasonable bid considering my hand and the potential for others to also have 6s.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:1 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 14506512, which contains two 6s. The current bid by Player 5 is 4 6s across all 32 digits in play among the 4 active players. Since I have two 6s, there need to be only two more 6s among the remaining 24 digits for the bid to be valid. Given the history of bids and the fact that 6s have been bid on before with a successful outcome (5 6s had an actual count of 6 in the previous round), it’s plausible that there are at least two more 6s out there. However, with only 4 players left and a relatively low bid of 4, I think it’s safer to raise the bid slightly rather than challenge. I’ll bid 5 6s, as it’s a modest increase and aligns with the previous round’s outcome suggesting 6s are present.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 2. I have a hand of 12442334, which contains two 6s. Given that there are 3 other active players and each has 8 digits, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. The bid of 5 6s seems plausible but I need to consider if I can make a higher bid or if it's likely to be false. Since I have two 6s, and assuming the other players might have a reasonable distribution, bidding a higher quantity or digit is risky without more information. However, I can try to make a slightly higher bid by increasing the quantity or the digit. Bidding 6 6s would be a straightforward increase in quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I must increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 6 and increase the digit. Since 6 is the digit currently bid, the next higher bid with the same quantity would be 6 7s. I have two 7s in my hand, which supports bidding 6 7s. Bidding 6 7s is a reasonable increase and plausible given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have zero 7s in my hand. Bidding higher on 7s would be a lie. I have two 6s, but the previous bids have already gone up to 6 6s and 6 7s. Bidding 7 6s or higher on 6s is unlikely to succeed. Given the history of challenges and wins, and my hand, challenging the current bid seems like the most reasonable action. The current bid of 6 7s seems high considering only 32 digits remain and I have no 7s.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None'. I have two 6s in my hand. A conservative bid would be 3 6s, but given the history of escalating bids and my hand, I can reasonably bid higher. Bidding 4 6s is a good starting point, increasing the quantity from a potential initial bid. There are 24 total digits remaining, so 4 6s is plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 14506512, which contains two 6s. The current bid is 4 6s made by Player 5. With a total of 24 digits across all three players, it's possible that there are at least 4 6s in play, especially since I have two myself. However, I need to make a higher bid than 4 6s. Bidding 5 6s feels risky because it would require at least 3 more 6s in the remaining 16 digits, which is plausible but not guaranteed. Alternatively, I could bid 4 7s to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, but I have no 7s in my hand, making it less confident. Given the history of bids on 6s and previous rounds showing a higher count of 6s (like 6 in a previous challenge), I think bidding 5 6s is a safer move than challenging or switching to a digit I have no information on. I will bid 5 6s to push the quantity higher while staying on a digit I have some strength in.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 2. I have 3 sixes in my hand. Given that there are only 24 digits in total and 3 players, the maximum possible count for any digit is 24. The bid of 5 6s seems high but not impossible. However, I do not have enough information about the other players' hands to be certain. I will bid higher than 5 6s. A reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity or the digit. Since 6 is not a high digit and 5 is a relatively high quantity, I will increase the digit. Bidding 5 7s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and I have a 7 in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 14506512, which contains two 6s. The current bid by Player 5 is 1 6s, which is very low and easily met since I alone have two 6s. With a total of 16 digits across both hands, I can safely bid higher. I will bid 2 6s, as it is a modest increase and still within a believable range given my own contribution to the count. This also avoids jumping to a much higher number that might invite a challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 14506512, which contains two 6s. The current bid by Player 5 is 3 6s, meaning there should be at least three 6s across all 16 digits. Since I have two 6s, Player 5 must have at least one 6 in their hand for the bid to hold. Given that there are only 8 digits in their hand, it's plausible they have one or more 6s. However, looking at the bidding history, Player 5 has been aggressive with bids on 6s in previous rounds, and they started low with 1 6s this round before raising to 3 6s. This could indicate confidence in having some 6s. I could bid higher, such as 4 6s, but with only two 6s in my hand, I would need Player 5 to have at least two 6s, which is less certain. Alternatively, challenging now tests the bid of 3 6s. If Player 5 has no 6s or just one, the total would be 2 or 3, and a challenge could win if it's exactly 2. However, since the bid is low relative to the total digits (16), and Player 5's history suggests they might have some 6s, I think it's safer to bid higher rather than challenge. I'll bid 4 6s, hoping to push Player 5 to either challenge or bid even higher, giving me more information.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Given that there are only 16 total digits remaining between the two of us, and Player 2 has already bid aggressively on 6s, a bid of 5 6s seems too risky. I could challenge, but Player 2 has shown a willingness to bid high on 6s, so they might actually have them. The safest option is to challenge the current bid of 4 6s. If they have 4 or more 6s, I lose, but if they have fewer, I win and eliminate Player 2.
