Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to assess the current situation. The current bid is '1 0s', which is very low. Looking at my hand (15705362), I have one 0 in it. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each (48 total digits), and assuming a roughly even distribution, each digit would appear about 4-5 times across all hands. I already know of one 0 in my hand, so it's very likely there are more zeros among the other players. I could safely bid higher on zeros, or I could switch to another digit. Since I have one 5 and one 7 in my hand, I might consider bidding on those. However, since this is the first round, I'll make a conservative but strategic bid by increasing the quantity of zeros, which I know exists at least once in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. The current bid of 2 0s is already covered by my two zeros and almost certainly more in other hands, so challenging would lose. Bidding 3 9s is a valid increase in quantity and is safe since my hand alone guarantees at least three 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which means there needs to be at least two more 9s among the other five players. Given that 9s are less common digits, this seems unlikely. However, I can make a safer bid by increasing the quantity and changing the digit to something more common, like 5s, of which I have two in my hand. Bidding 4 5s is a reasonable increase from 3 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. I have the following digits in my hand: 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1, 1. Counting the 5s, I only have one 5, so it's unlikely that there are 4 or more 5s across all players. Challenging the bid seems prudent as this bid is quite high and unlikely to be true, given my hand and the total remaining digits.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. Since the current bid is None and I'm the first to bid in this round, I should make a conservative bid based on my hand. Bidding 1 5s is a safe starting point.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand. Bidding 2 1s ensures the bid is at least truthful based on my own digits, making it a safe and valid higher bid than the current 1 5s. This guarantees the total count cannot be less than 2, reducing risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (15705362), I have one 2 in it. The current bid is '2 2s', meaning Player 0 believes there are at least 2 twos among all players. Since I have 1 two, this means there needs to be at least 1 more two among the other 4 players, which is quite reasonable. The probability of having at least one more 2 among 32 remaining digits (40-8) is high. I could challenge, but it's risky given the low bid. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have one 3 in my hand, so I could bid '2 3s', which is higher than '2 2s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity. This is a safe move that advances the game while using my knowledge of my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand, so bidding 3 9s guarantees at least three 9s in total. It strictly raises the quantity from 2 to 3 and outbids the current 2 3s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand (from my digits 27125598). The current bid is 3 9s, which means there needs to be at least two more 9s among the other four players (total of 32 digits). Given that 9s are less common digits, it's unlikely there are two more 9s in the remaining hands. Therefore, challenging seems like the best move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have three 9s in my hand. With 24 unknown digits among the other three players, I’d expect about 2.4 more 9s, for an expected total of around 5.4. Bidding 4 9s is a conservative, strong opening that’s unlikely to be challenged immediately.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. With 32 total digits remaining and my hand containing no 9s, the expected number of 9s across all hands is approximately 3.2 (based on uniform probability). Statistical analysis suggests a ~78% chance that the actual count is less than 4. Player 2's previous bid of 3 9s (in a larger 40-digit pool) resulted in 5, but this round's smaller pool and my lack of 9s make the bid of 4 9s statistically unlikely. Challenging offers a favorable risk-reward ratio.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (15705362), I have zero 9s. The current bid is 3 9s, meaning Player 2 is claiming there are at least 3 nines between our hands. Since I have none, all 3 would need to be in Player 2's hand. This is certainly possible, but not guaranteed. Player 2 has successfully defended multiple 9s bids in previous rounds, suggesting they likely have multiple 9s. Given this history, I think it's risky to challenge. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have one 0, so bidding 4 0s would require Player 2 to have three 0s, which seems unlikely. I'll bid 4 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand, so for the bid of 4 0s to be true there must be at least two more 0s in my opponent’s 8 cards. The probability of that is only about 19%, so challenging gives me roughly an 81% chance to win immediately. Any higher bid has a lower success probability. Therefore I should challenge.
