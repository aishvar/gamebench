Player 0 Reasoning: As the first player, I should make an initial bid to start the game. I have 4 eights in my hand, so bidding 4 8s seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s. With 6 players and 8 digits each, the average count of any digit is 4. A bid of 4 8s is exactly the average expectation. However, since I have zero 8s, the other 5 players would need to have an average of 0.8 8s each to meet the bid. This is not impossible, but it's also not a strong indicator for me to bid higher on 8s. Looking at my hand (72320515), I have two 2s and two 5s. Bidding on 2s or 5s seems more promising. I will bid 5 2s, increasing the quantity while changing the digit to one I have multiples of.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 2s and my hand of 78091672, I notice that I have no 2s in my hand, which might suggest that bidding on 2s could be risky. However, I also see that I have multiple occurrences of other digits. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 48 and there are 6 players, the average number of any single digit across all players would be around 8 (48 total digits / 6 possible digits in a uniform distribution). Since the current bid is for 5 occurrences of the digit 2, and given that my hand does not contain any 2s, it seems plausible that there could be at least 5 twos among all players, especially considering that some players might have more than one 2. Given this, challenging the bid might not be the safest option without more information. Instead, I should look to make a higher bid. Noticing my hand contains two 6s and considering the need to make a strictly higher bid, I could either increase the quantity of the same digit or bid on a higher digit with the same or higher quantity. Since I have two 6s and no 2s, and the current bid is for 5 2s, bidding on 6s seems like a strategic move. I will bid on 6s, increasing the digit from 2 to 6, which is a higher digit, thus making a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have 0 6s in my hand, leaving 40 digits across 5 other players. The expected number of 6s in 40 digits is 4 (10% of 40). Using Poisson approximation, the probability of â‰¥5 6s is ~37%, meaning the bid is more likely false (63% chance). Challenging has a higher probability of success.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current state of the game with no bids yet in this round, I need to make an opening bid. I have two 7s and two 6s in my hand (78091672). Since I'm starting the bidding, I should aim for a reasonable quantity and digit that doesn't overcommit. Considering the total digits remaining (40) and the distribution across 5 players, bidding on a digit I have in my hand could be strategic. However, I must also consider the likelihood of other players having the same digits. Given my hand and the need to start with a bid that is not too high but still competitive, I will choose a digit and quantity that reflects my hand's composition without being overly optimistic.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. My hand contains no 7s, but others might. Bidding 5 7s increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This forces the next player to either challenge or bid higher, leveraging the possibility that the actual count of 7s could be higher than 4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s, which seems very low considering there are 32 total digits remaining. I have 2 8s and 2 3s, but no 0s. Given the low bid, I should bid on a higher digit with a higher quantity to increase the chances of winning, but I don't have any 0s to bid on. Instead, I should bid on a digit that I have a higher quantity of, which is 8s, and increase the quantity to 3, making it a more believable bid.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:2 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 72320515. I have zero 8s. The current bid is 3 8s. With 32 total digits across 4 players, an average of 8 of each digit would be expected if they were evenly distributed.  3 8s is a plausible bid, but without any 8s in my hand, I have less confidence in a higher bid of 8s. I need to bid higher than 3 8s.  I have two 2s, one 0, one 1, one 3, one 5, and one 7. Bidding 4 of any digit is an option. Bidding 4 2s seems reasonable given I have two 2s. Bidding 4 0s, 4 1s, 4 3s, 4 5s, or 4 7s is also possible, but less supported by my hand. Increasing the digit to 9s or 0s at the same quantity (3) is also an option, but I have no 9s and only one 0. Bidding 4 2s seems like the safest and most supported bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. Given my hand, 78091672, I have one 2 and no other information about the distribution of 2s among other players. However, I notice that bidding higher than 4 2s requires either increasing the quantity or bidding on a higher digit. Since I have a 7 and a 9 in my hand, and considering the total number of digits remaining is 32, it might be reasonable to explore higher digits. But, without concrete information about the distribution of higher digits among other players, this is a risky strategy. On the other hand, challenging the current bid of 4 2s could be a viable option if I believe the total count of 2s across all players is less than 4, given that I only have one 2 in my hand. Considering the risk and the potential reward, and given that I only have one 2, I might lean towards challenging if I had more confidence in my assessment of the total 2s. However, without more information, making a bid that is higher and reasonable based on the game's progression seems like a safer bet. Since I have to make a bid that is strictly higher, and considering my hand does not offer a clear advantage in any particular digit, I must think strategically about what could be a plausible next bid. Given that the previous bid was 4 2s, and considering the need to increase either the quantity or the digit, a reasonable approach could be to consider digits that are less likely to be abundant, given the bids that have been made and the digits that have been challenged. The presence of 7s and 9s in my hand, and considering the bids that have been successful or challenged, suggests that higher digits might be less represented. Therefore, increasing the quantity might be a safer bet than increasing the digit, especially since we are at a relatively low quantity of 4. A bid of 5 on any digit seems risky without more information about the distribution of those digits. Given these considerations, and the fact that I need to make a decision based on incomplete information, I will choose to bid on a digit that I think might have a reasonable presence without being too common, aiming to balance the risk of overbidding with the need to make a higher bid.

Bidding 4 2s is a valid higher bid that increases the quantity and is supported by my hand.
