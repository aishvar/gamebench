Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains three 2s (92272425), making it the most frequent digit I hold. Since there are 48 total digits across 6 players, bidding 4 2s is a reasonable starting bid based on my own count and the likelihood of others having additional 2s. This bid leverages my strong position in this digit while setting a moderate threshold that challenges opponents to overbid or risk a challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand and zero 2s. The next valid raise is 4 3s. That requires just two more 3s among the 40 unknown digits, which is very likely (~95%).

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. I could challenge, but it's not an incredibly high bid given there are 48 total digits. I will bid slightly higher to 5 0s, increasing the quantity and hoping others don't have many 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s and two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 5 0s. I could bid 6 6s or 6 8s, but since I only have two of each, it's risky. Player 2 might have several 0s, making my bid likely to fail if challenged. However, challenging 5 0s seems too risky because there are 48 total digits remaining, and it's possible that 5 0s exist among all players. I'll bid 6 1s instead, as it's a safer increase from the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:0 - o3-2025-04-16) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Challenging 6 1s is unattractive: I only hold one 1, and Player 3’s willingness to make that bid suggests they probably have at least two 1s, giving the bid a good chance (around 60-70%) of being true. Instead I should overbid. I have two 5s—the joint-highest count in my hand—so keeping the quantity at 6 and raising the digit to 5 is the most credible option. With 48 digits in play, needing just four more 5s among the 40 unknown digits gives roughly a 57% chance the bid is valid, which is better than challenging. Therefore I’ll bid 6 5s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains a 6, and the current bid is 6 5s. Bidding 6 6s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my knowledge of my own digits and the need to outbid the previous 5s with a higher value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have four 2s in my hand. Given the independence assumption, other players' hands are expected to contain around 4.0 2s total (40 digits * 10% probability). This makes the total count of 2s likely >=7 (4+4), justifying a bid of 7 2s. This bid is strictly higher than the current 6 6s by quantity and leverages my strong private information about 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 2s in my hand. With only 40 unknown digits and roughly a 10% chance for each to be a 2, the probability of there being seven or more 2s is only about 11%. The bid is highly unlikely, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. With 40 digits total, the expected count of any digit is about 4. Bidding 4 3s is a moderate opening bid—since I hold half of them, it’s likely there are at least two more in the other hands, and this pressures opponents to raise the digit instead of the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. I can either bid higher (5 of any digit, or 4 of a digit higher than 3) or challenge. Since I don't have any 3s, it's risky to bid higher without any information. I will bid 5 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s and two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 5 0s. I can make a higher bid with 6 6s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Alternatively, I could challenge the current bid of 5 0s, as it seems unlikely that there are 5 0s among all players' hands, given that only one 0 is in my hand and there are no guarantees of others having more. However, challenging might be risky if others have multiple 0s. Bidding 6 6s is a safer and valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:0 - o3-2025-04-16) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I only hold one 6. For Player 3’s bid of 6 6s to be correct, the other 32 hidden digits must contain at least five more 6s. With a uniform 10% chance per digit, the expected number of 6s in those 32 cards is about 3.2, and the probability of there being 5 or more is roughly 20%. That makes the bid unlikely. Any higher bid I could make would be even riskier given my weak counts in other digits. Challenging gives me roughly an 80% chance to win, far better than raising and being challenged myself.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None'. Since I have two 6s in my hand, I can make a reasonable bid. I should aim to increase both the quantity and the digit. Bidding 7 7s seems like a strong opening bid, as it's higher than any previous bids in terms of quantity and digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 7s. I have three 7s in my hand, and with 24 remaining digits across three other players, it's possible the total 7s could be 7 or more. However, challenging risks losing if the actual count meets or exceeds 7. But given the uncertainty and the possibility that others may not have enough 7s, challenging could be a viable option to test the bid's validity.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains three 7s. Since the current bid is None, I should start with a bid that reflects my highest digit count. Bidding 3 7s is a logical first move, as it accurately represents the quantity of 7s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I hold two 3s. The current bid of 3 7s would require two more 7s in the 16 unknown cards (≈49% chance). Instead, I can bid 4 3s: I need two more 3s among those 16 (also ≈49%), but I leverage my two known 3s and make a strictly higher bid by quantity. This is a reasonable, low‐risk raise.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. I could bid 5 0s since I have one 0. However, given the game history and the fact that there are only 24 digits remaining, I think bidding 5 0s is a bit risky. I will bid 5 1s since I have two 1s in my hand. This is a safe bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. My hand contains no 1s, and with three players each holding 8 digits (24 total), it's uncertain if there are at least 5 ones. Given the lack of 1s in my hand and the possibility that others may not have enough, challenging the bid is a strategic move to test its validity.
