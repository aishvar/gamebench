Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 9 in my hand. Given it's the first round and no one has bid yet, I should start by bidding a reasonable quantity and digit. Bidding 2 9s seems like a good starting point, increasing the quantity and digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand, but the expected average count for any digit (including 9s) across 48 digits is 4.8, making Player 0's bid of 2 9s statistically likely. Challenging would be risky. Instead, I should raise the bid to 3 6s, leveraging my two 6s and the requirement to increase quantity over the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand (05035503). With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. Player 1 claims there are at least 3 6s. While this is possible, I can see that none of the 8 digits in my hand are 6s, meaning there would need to be 3 6s among the remaining 40 digits held by other players. Given I have zero 6s and it's still early in the game, I think challenging is safer than making a higher bid without any supporting evidence in my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s. Bidding 4 7s increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my hand's 7s while adhering to the rules of increasing quantity.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:0 - o3-2025-04-16) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I hold two 6s and zero 7s. The current bid of 4 7s is about average for 40 digits, so a challenge would only succeed a little over half the time. Instead, I can raise on a digit I already have. By bidding 5 6s, I increase the quantity (making the bid strictly higher) and back it with my own two known 6s. With 32 hidden digits remaining, the expected additional number of 6s is about 3.2, giving roughly a 60%+ chance that at least three more 6s exist, making the bid statistically solid while avoiding the immediate 40% elimination risk of challenging.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Considering my hand (03845994), I have no 6s, but I have a 5. Given the current bid is 5 6s, I should bid on a different digit. Since I have a 9, I can bid on that, and it's higher than the current digit in the bid. I'll bid 2 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I start the bidding this round. My hand contains two 6s. With 24 unknown digits still out there, the expected number of additional 6s is about 2–3, giving roughly a 70% chance that there are at least four 6s total. The previous round revealed five 6s among 40 digits, so four among 32 seems perfectly credible. This opening bid is strong enough to apply some pressure but not so high that it invites an immediate challenge.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:5 - qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand, which means the remaining three players (24 digits) would need at least two more 6s to meet the bid. The average expected count for any digit across 32 digits is 3.2, so 4 is slightly above average. However, given that the expected total count of 6s (including my two) is ~3.2, the probability of the actual count being ≥4 is less than 50%. This makes challenging the bid statistically favorable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: As the opening bidder I must make the first claim. I already hold two 6s. With 24 unseen digits spread between the other two players, the expected number of additional 6s is about 1.6, giving roughly an 80% chance that at least one more 6 is out there. Starting with a bid of 3 6s is therefore statistically safe while still strong enough not to be trivial.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This leverages the higher digit value without assuming additional 7s from other players.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:0 - o3-2025-04-16) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, so only two more are needed among the sixteen unknown digits for a total of four. Given that 6s have shown up frequently this game (my earlier bid of 4 6s was successful), reaching four is quite plausible. Challenging 3 8s feels dangerous because Player 4 probably has at least two 8s, giving their bid a fair chance of being correct. Therefore, increasing the quantity while switching back to a digit I hold is the safer course.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s. My hand contains no 0s, and the total digits remaining are 16. If I challenge, the actual count of 0s will be revealed. Since I have no 0s, if Player 3 also lacks 0s, the count will be 0, making the bid invalid. This challenge risks elimination but could eliminate Player 3 if the bid is false.
