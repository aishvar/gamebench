Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: In my hand of 8 digits, I have: one 0, zero 1s, two 2s, one 3, one 4, zero 5s, zero 6s, one 7, one 8. Since I'm opening the bidding, I should make a conservative bid based on what I know for certain. With two 2s in my hand, bidding '3 2s' is relatively safe as I only need one more 2 among the other 40 digits held by other players to make this bid valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains the digits 7, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 5, 2, so I have three 2s, and potentially more of other digits. The current bid is 3 2s, which matches exactly the number of 2s I hold. To be safe and to increase the bid, I should raise either the quantity or the digit. Since I have 3 2s, bidding 4 2s would be unlikely unless I have more, which I don't. Alternatively, I can increase the digit to 3, bidding 3 3s, or higher. Given I have no 3s, bidding 3 3s would be risky. The best move is to increase the digit to 4, as I have no 4s either. Therefore, I will bid 4 2s, which is a valid higher bid than 3 2s.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. My hand contains no 2s, but I have two 3s. Bidding 4 3s increases the digit value while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 3s and shifts pressure to other players to either raise further or challenge based on their confidence in 3s distribution.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have no 3s in my hand, making the current bid of 4 3s somewhat risky, but not impossible given 48 total digits. However, I have two 8s and two 9s. Bidding 4 8s leverages my strong hand and is a safe, strictly higher bid (same quantity, higher digit).

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. Bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid as it maintains the same quantity but increases the digit. This leverages the rule that same quantity with a higher digit is acceptable. My hand has no 9s, but the bid doesn't require holding the digit, only that the claim is higher. This move pressures others to respond to a higher digit without risking an immediate challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits. The expected number of any digit is 4.8. I have one 9 in my hand (59867634). This means the other 40 digits held by the other 5 players need to contain at least three 9s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 9s among the other 40 digits is 4. Thus, the expected total number of 9s is 1 (mine) + 4 (others) = 5. Challenging 4 9s is risky as it's likely true. I need to make a higher bid. Since 4 9s is the highest bid with quantity 4, I must increase the quantity to 5. Looking at my hand (59867634), I have two 6s, which is the most frequent digit. Bidding 5 6s is a statistically reasonable next step. I have two 6s, and the expected number of 6s among the other 40 digits is 4, making the expected total 6. Therefore, bidding 5 6s is a plausible and defensible bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (34878202), I have zero 6s. The current bid claims there are at least 5 sixes among all players. With 6 players and 8 digits each, this is possible but seems unlikely given: 1) I have no 6s, reducing the pool to 40 digits where 5 sixes must be found, 2) Players have been making relatively conservative bids (mostly 4 of a kind), 3) No one else has bid on 6s before, suggesting they might not have many. The bid of 5 6s seems optimistic, making it a good challenge opportunity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I am Player 5 and it's my turn to make the first bid. There are 5 players and 40 total digits. The expected average count for any digit is 40 / 10 = 4. My hand is 59867634, which contains two 6s. This is above average for a single player. Leveraging this information, a bid involving 6s is logical. The total expected number of 6s across all hands is approximately 4 (the average), but given I have two, the expected total is closer to 2 (my hand) + (32 unknown digits / 10) = 2 + 3.2 = 5.2. Bidding '4 6s' is a safe opening bid, below the expected total count, utilizing my hand's strength without being overly aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s, and I have the digits 7, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 5, 2 in my hand. Counting the 6s, I have zero. Since the bid claims there are at least 4 sixes across all hands, this is highly unlikely given my hand and the total of 40 digits. Challenging now could reveal the truth and eliminate the previous bidder if the count is less than 4. Given the low likelihood of the bid being correct, I will challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round with 4 players and 32 total digits. My hand is 59867634, containing two 6s and one each of 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9. The expected average count for any digit is 3.2 (32/10). Since I have two 6s, the expected total number of 6s across all hands is higher than average (2 in my hand + approx. 2.4 in the other 24 digits = 4.4). I won the last two rounds bidding on 6s, and the actual count was 6 both times (with 48 and 40 total digits respectively). While bidding 6s again might draw suspicion, it's statistically my strongest digit. An opening bid of '3 6s' is below the expected total of 4.4, making it a relatively safe starting point based on my hand, while still being credible.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which is likely true given the previous round's outcome where 6 6s existed. Bidding 4 6s increases the quantity while maintaining the digit, which is plausible since I have one and there are 24 digits across other players. Challenging would be risky as the count is likely to meet or exceed 3.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 95689381, which contains one 6. With 4 players and 8 digits each, there are 32 digits in play. The current bid is 4 6s. Given that I have only one 6, and assuming a uniform distribution, the expected number of 6s across all hands would be about 3.2. Previous rounds show that 6s have been successfully bid at higher quantities, but that was with more digits in play. However, since I have only one 6, it is risky to raise the quantity, but I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have two 8s and one 9, so bidding 4 8s is safer based on my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains two 6s. The current bid is 4 8s. Bidding 5 6s increases the quantity beyond the current bid, making it a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 6s and aims to pressure others to respond.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s by Player 4. I have two 6s in my hand (59867634). For the bid to be true, the other three players (24 digits) need to have at least three more 6s combined. Player 2 previously bid 4 6s and Player 4 bid 5 6s, suggesting they likely hold some 6s, making 5 6s plausible. Challenging seems risky. I need to make a higher bid. Options are 5 7s, 5 8s, 5 9s, or 6 of something. Player 3 previously bid 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Combining my 8 with Player 3's likely holding of 8s (potentially 2 or 3 based on their bid), a bid of 5 8s seems well-supported. It requires only one or two more 8s from the remaining two players (Players 2 and 4), which is plausible. This bid leverages Player 3's information and my hand, putting pressure on the next player.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. My hand contains no 8s, and with 32 total digits across 4 players, the expected number of 8s is ~3.2. Bidding higher (e.g., 5 9s) risks an uncertain claim, while challenging the 5 8s bid leverages the low probability of 5+ 8s existing. The likelihood of the bid being false is high enough to justify the challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: As the first bid in this round, I need to make a valid starting bid. My hand contains two 0s, so bidding 3 0s is plausible, assuming at least one other player has a 0. This is a conservative bid based on my own digits and the total digits remaining (24).

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 95689381, which contains no 0s. The current bid is 3 0s. With 24 digits in play and 8 in my hand, there are 16 digits I don't see. Statistically, the expected number of 0s in 24 digits is about 2.4. Since I have zero 0s, for the bid to be valid, all 3 (or more) 0s must be in the other two players' hands. This is possible but somewhat unlikely. Given that it's early in the round and the bid isn't outrageous, it's still plausible. Instead of challenging, I should make a higher bid. I have two 8s and one 9, so bidding 3 8s (same quantity, higher digit) is a safe and reasonable move.
