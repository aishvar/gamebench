Player 0 Reasoning: Since I'm starting the bidding and have 8 digits in my hand, I can make a confident opening bid based on what I see. In my hand, I have one 1, one 2, one 6, one 7, one 8, one 9, and two 1s. A conservative opening bid would be to bid based on what I can see plus a reasonable estimate of what others might have. Since I have two 1s, bidding '3 1s' is relatively safe as it only requires one more 1 among the other 40 digits in play.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 1s. I have zero 1s in my hand. Bidding 4 1s would be a lie, and potentially risky. However, I have two 2s, one 5, one 6, and two 8s. Bidding 4 2s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and I have some 2s to support the bid. Bidding 3 3s would also be reasonable, but I think 4 2s is slightly better as it is a bigger jump and I have two 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 2s' by Player 1, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Looking at my hand, 50970397, I notice I have one 5 and no other digits that are significantly represented. Since I don't have enough information about the other players' hands and given that my hand doesn't provide a clear advantage for bidding on any specific digit, I should consider the overall probability and the fact that bidding on higher digits may be riskier due to potentially lower frequencies. However, I must bid higher than '4 2s', which means I could either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same or higher quantity. Given that I have a 5 and no 2s, and considering the total number of digits remaining, bidding on a higher digit seems like a viable strategy. Bidding '4 5s' increases the digit value while keeping the quantity the same as the current bid, making it a higher bid according to the game rules.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand out of the current bid of 4 5s by Player 2. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an average of about 4.8 of each digit is expected across all hands. Since the bid of 4 5s is slightly below the average, it seems plausible. I will make a higher bid to continue the game. I have two 6s and two 8s in my hand, so bidding on 6s or 8s could be safer. I’ll bid 5 6s, increasing both the quantity and the digit, which seems reasonable given my hand and the total possible digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. There are 48 total digits. The expected average count for any digit is 4.8. I have zero 6s in my hand (35039711). Based on my hand, the expected number of 6s among the remaining 40 digits is 40/10 = 4. So, the total expected number of 6s is 4. While 5 6s is slightly above this expectation, it's not highly improbable, making a challenge risky this early.

I need to make a higher bid. Options are quantity 6+ (any digit) or quantity 5 (digit 7, 8, or 9).
My hand contains two 1s. The expected total number of 1s is 2 (my hand) + 4 (expected from others) = 6. Player 0 previously bid 3 1s, suggesting they might hold some 1s as well, potentially increasing the actual count. Bidding 6 1s is statistically supported by my hand and the expected distribution, and it aligns with Player 0's earlier interest. This seems like a safer and more strategic move than challenging or bidding on digits I hold fewer of.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 50302407. I have three 0s, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, and one 7. The current bid is 6 1s.  I need to bid higher. I have no 1s.  A bid of 6 2s is a valid higher bid and I have one 2.  With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits.  A bid of 6 2s seems plausible, as it's less than the average expected occurrences of any digit (48/10 = 4.8).

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand. For the current bid of '6 2s' to be valid, there would need to be 5 more 2s among the other players' hands. While possible, the fact that Player 1 previously bid '4 2s' and Player 5 raised to '6 2s' without much escalation in between makes it suspicious. Since I can see only one 2, and the previous bidder who bid '4 2s' likely has some 2s, it seems unlikely there are enough additional 2s to reach 6 total. A challenge is safer than making a higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first player to bid in this round. I have three 0s, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, and one 7 in my hand. With 40 total digits, a bid of 3 0s is a safe starting point, reflecting the strong presence of 0s in my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Bidding 4 0s is a reasonable increase in quantity, and still plausible given the total number of digits remaining (40). It's a relatively safe bid that doesn't reveal too much about my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 0s and I have one 0 in my hand (50970397), increasing the quantity seems risky without more information about other players' hands. However, considering the total digits remaining and the distribution, bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity could be a safer approach. Since my hand contains a 3, a 7, and no other repeating digits, and the bid history shows a mix of bids across different digits, I'll choose a digit that hasn't been recently bid on to minimize the risk of immediate challenge. Given the constraints and aiming to make a reasonable bid, I'll consider the presence of my digits and the fact that 4 is a relatively low quantity, allowing for some flexibility.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 26428568, which contains no 3s. The current bid is 4 3s by Player 2. With 40 total digits across 5 players, it's possible that there are at least 4 3s in play, as I have none, meaning they could be distributed among the other players. However, since I have two 6s and two 8s, I can make a higher bid that feels safer based on my own hand. Bidding 5 6s increases the quantity and leverages the fact that I contribute two 6s to the total count, making it more plausible. I’ll avoid challenging since 4 3s is not an unreasonable bid with 40 digits in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 35039711, containing one 0, two 1s, two 3s, one 5, one 7, and one 9. The current bid is 5 6s. I have zero 6s. With 40 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 4. A bid of 5 6s requires 5 sixes among the other 32 digits (held by 4 players), which is slightly above the expected value of 3.2 for those digits. Challenging is an option, but 5 6s isn't extremely unlikely yet. I should consider a higher bid. Possible bids are 5 7s, 5 8s, 5 9s, or starting with quantity 6. I have one 7 and one 9, making 5 7s or 5 9s plausible minimal bids. However, I have two 1s and two 3s. Bidding 6 1s requires 4 more 1s among the 32 unknown digits (expected 3.2), which is well-supported by my hand. Bidding 6 3s is similarly supported (requires 4 more 3s), but Player 2 just bid 4 3s, making this bid potentially more contentious. Bidding 6 1s seems like a strong, relatively safe bid based on my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 50302407. I have three 0s, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, and one 7. The current bid is 6 1s.  I have no 1s.  With 5 players and 40 total digits, the average count of any digit is 4.  A bid of 6 1s is slightly above average, but not impossible. Given I have three 0s, bidding on 0s is a strong option. The current bid is 6 1s. I can bid 6 2s (same quantity, higher digit) or increase the quantity. Since I have three 0s, bidding 7 0s is a reasonable increase in quantity based on my hand strength for 0s. Bidding 6 2s is also an option, but I only have one 2. Bidding 7 0s seems safer and more likely to be true.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 0s. I have one 0 in my hand. Given the previous rounds and the fact that Player 5 has already bid on 0s twice, successfully, it seems risky to challenge. I can bid 8 0s, which is a valid higher bid. Alternatively, I could bid on another digit I have, but 0s have already been established as present in multiple hands. Bidding 8 0s feels like the most logical next step, even if it's a slight increase.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 8 0s, I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. With my hand being 50970397, I have one 0, which doesn't give me strong confidence in the existence of 8 or more 0s across all players. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 40 and each player has 8 digits, the maximum number of any single digit is 40. However, achieving exactly 8 0s seems plausible but not extremely likely given the random distribution of digits. Since my hand doesn't provide strong evidence against the bid of 8 0s and considering the bidding history where players have made somewhat aggressive bids, challenging might be risky without strong counter-evidence. Given that I must make a strictly higher bid than 8 0s, and knowing that making a bid for a higher quantity of the same digit (0s) is not possible without exceeding the plausible total count of 0s, I must consider bidding on a higher digit. However, without specific knowledge of the distribution of higher digits, any bid for a higher digit (e.g., 1s, 2s, etc.) at the same or higher quantity than 8 is speculative. Since my hand contains digits other than 0, such as 3, 5, 7, and 9, and considering the need for a higher bid, I could speculate on these digits. But, any bid for these digits at quantity 8 or higher is risky without more information. Given these considerations, and knowing that the bid must be strictly higher, a safe approach is to consider the digit '1' since it's the next logical step after '0' and my hand doesn't provide strong evidence against the current bid of 8 0s. Thus, bidding on '1s' with a quantity that is reasonable and higher than the current bid in terms of digit value seems like a viable strategy. However, given the constraints and the aim for a higher bid, challenging the current bid might be more strategic if one believes the actual count of 0s is less than 8, considering the risk of elimination if the challenge fails.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 1s by Player 2. In my hand, I have no 1s, which means I contribute nothing to this count. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, an average of 4 ones per player would be needed to reach a total of 20 ones, but the bid is only 8, which is plausible. However, looking at the bidding history, bids have been increasing steadily, and players might be bluffing. Since I have no 1s, I’m inclined to think the count might be lower than bid. However, challenging is risky without strong evidence, and 8 1s out of 40 digits is statistically reasonable (about 20% of digits). I’ll play it safe and make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding on 6s feels comfortable. I’ll bid 9 2s to increase both the quantity and the digit, keeping the bid plausible while pushing the risk to the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 9 2s. There are 40 total digits among 5 players. The expected number of any digit is 40/10 = 4. A bid of 9 is significantly higher than the average. My hand (35039711) contains zero 2s. This means the other 4 players (32 digits) must hold at least nine 2s for the bid to be true. The expected number of 2s among those 32 digits is 3.2. Requiring almost triple the expected amount makes the bid highly suspect. Making a higher bid, like 9 3s (I have two 3s, need 7 more from 32) or 10 1s (I have two 1s, need 8 more from 32), also seems statistically unlikely to be true and risky. Therefore, challenging the high bid of 9 2s is the most strategically sound move.

Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 0s and I have one 0 in my hand (50970397), I need to consider the likelihood of there being at least four 0s among all players. With 24 digits remaining and each player having 8 digits, the distribution of digits is crucial. Since I only have one 0, to make a bid that is strictly higher, I must either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Considering the total number of digits and the fact that we are already at a relatively high quantity for 0s, bidding on a higher digit seems more reasonable. However, without more information about the distribution of other digits, making a significantly higher bid could be risky. Given my hand, I notice I have a few occurrences of higher digits, but not enough to confidently bid higher quantities on those digits without more information. Challenging the current bid of 4 0s could be a viable option if I believe it's unlikely there are at least four 0s among all players, considering my own contribution of one 0. Yet, the decision to challenge should be based on a strong belief that the bid is unlikely, given the potential for other players to hold multiple 0s. Since my hand does not provide strong evidence against the existence of four 0s (given I only see my own hand), and considering the strategic aspect of the game where players might bid based on their hand's strength or bluff, a cautious approach would be to consider bidding on a digit that I have more of, if feasible, or challenging if I had stronger evidence against the bid's validity. Given the constraints and aiming to make a move that is informed by my hand and the game's state, I must weigh the risks of bidding higher against the potential gain of challenging. Since I don't have enough information to confidently challenge or significantly raise the bid on another digit, and given the structure of the game where each move must be strategically considered, my decision will hinge on the balance between these strategic options.

Player 2 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 7 0s and my hand 50970397, which contains no 0s, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least 7 zeros among all active players. Since each player has 8 digits and there are 3 active players, the total number of digits is 24. The highest possible bid for any digit is 24, but given that my hand does not contain any zeros, I have to rely on the bidding history and the nature of the game to make my decision. The bidding history shows a progression towards higher bids on the digit 0, culminating in the current bid of 7 0s. Considering the total number of digits remaining (24) and the fact that I don't have any 0s in my hand, making a higher bid on 0s seems risky. However, challenging the bid could also be risky if the other players do have a significant number of 0s. Given that I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than 7 0s, and considering the constraints of the game, I could bid on a higher digit with the same quantity or increase the quantity on a lower digit. Since my hand contains a 3, a 7, and other digits, but no 0s, and given the need to make a higher bid, I will choose to increase the quantity on a digit that I have in my hand, which seems more plausible than bidding on 0s without having any. However, the safest option, given the information and the need to make a move, is to challenge the current bid if I believe it's unlikely, or make a bid that I think is reasonable based on my hand and the game's progression. Given the progression and the fact that I have digits in my hand that could support a bid, but considering the risk, I will opt to make a bid that reflects a balance between the risk of challenging and the plausibility of the bid based on my hand and the game state.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 3s. My hand is 50302407. I have one 3.  With 24 total digits, the average count of any digit is 2.4. A bid of 8 for any digit is already quite high, and 8 3s seems very unlikely given I only have one 3.  While I could bid higher, challenging seems like the best move given the high bid and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Player 5 bid 3 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, so there are potentially 4 0s total. Bidding 4 0s is a reasonable next step, increasing the quantity. It's not overly aggressive, considering the limited number of total digits remaining (16).

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor) [2 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have three 0s in my hand. The current bid is 4 0s. With 16 total digits, the expected number of 0s is around 1.6 (16 * 0.1). Player 1's bid of 4 0s is already higher than the expected value and my own count. Given the limited total digits and my knowledge of my hand, challenging seems like a reasonable move as 4 0s is unlikely to be met.
