Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. As the first bid, choosing a quantity slightly higher than my own count (3) for a digit I hold (2) provides a conservative and plausible starting point. This bid is likely to be true given the total digits in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have two 2s in my hand. Given the low quantity, I can safely increase the quantity to 4 and keep the same digit, which is a more conservative approach.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one '2' in my hand. The current bid is 4 2s, which means Player 1 is claiming there are at least four '2's across all players' hands. With 5 other players, it's possible but risky. Since I have one, there would need to be at least three more among the other five players. I could bid higher, but with only one '2' in my hand, it's safer to challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current total digits remaining is 40, and the highest possible quantity for any digit is 40. Player 0 previously bid 3 2s. Given my hand contains no 2s, I should increase both quantity and digit to make a valid bid.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:0 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 4 3s and my hand containing one 3, I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Since I have one 3, it's possible that the total count of 3s could be around or slightly above 4, considering there are 40 digits in total and 5 players. However, bidding higher requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. Given that my hand doesn't provide strong evidence for a significantly higher quantity of any specific digit, and considering the risk of overbidding, challenging the current bid seems like a reasonable strategy, especially since the bid of 4 3s might be on the higher side given the total number of digits remaining.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I can make any valid bid. I have a 1 in my hand. Since I have a low-digit number, I should start by bidding on a low digit to maximize the chances of winning. Bidding 1 1s seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 1s. I have two 1s in my hand. Therefore, it's likely that the bid is valid, but I can bid higher to force the other players to make a more risky bid. I will bid 2 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 1s. I have no '1's in my hand, so I cannot rely on my own cards to support this bid. However, the bid is low and likely safe. I must make a higher bid than 2 1s. The next higher bid could be 2 2s or 3 0s. I have two '3's in my hand, so bidding 2 3s is a valid higher bid and plausible since other players may have some 3s as well.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:1 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s. I have two 2s in my hand. Bidding 3 2s is a valid higher bid (increased quantity) and leverages my existing 2s. Since the expected number of 2s across all players is 3.2, there's a reasonable chance the bid is true. Challenging the 2 3s bid is riskier, as the expected count of 3s is also 3.2, making it likely the bid is valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. I have one 2 in my hand. I can increase the quantity to 4, which is a reasonable guess considering the previous bid and the number of digits remaining. Additionally, I have no other high-value digits in my hand that I can use to bid on.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I don't have any 2s, but I also don't have any strong reason to believe the bid is incorrect. I will bid higher to stay in the game. I can bid 4 3s, matching the quantity and increasing the digit. I could also bid 5 0s, 5 1s, etc. Since the previous bid was 3 2s, and the current bid is only 4 2s, I don't think challenging is the correct move. Bidding 5 0s seems like a safe increase.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s, and I have two 3s in my hand. The next valid bid must be higher than 5 0s, so either 6 of any digit or 5 of a digit higher than 0. I have two 3s, but bidding 6 0s seems risky without having any 0s myself. Bidding 5 1s or higher digits might be safer. Since 5 1s is higher than 5 0s and I have one '7' and one '9', bidding 5 1s is a reasonable step up, as 1 is the next digit after 0 and the quantity is the same. This keeps the bid reasonable and not too aggressive, increasing the chance others have the digit 1 as well.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:1 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s. I have one 1 in my hand, so at least four more 1s would need to exist in the remaining 24 digits of the other three players. Given the expected distribution of digits (3.2 total 1s across 32 digits), a bid of 5 1s exceeds this average. Challenging is statistically plausible as the probability of 5+ 1s being present is low. Bidding higher risks escalating an unlikely claim.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 3 2s is reasonable, as it adds to the count based on my own digits. Since there are three players, the total possible 2s could be up to 3, but bidding slightly higher encourages further gameplay.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. I could bid 4 0s, increasing the quantity and using my 0s. However, since I have two 1s in my hand, and 1s have been bid before, I will bid 4 1s to increase the quantity and hope the other players don't have many 1s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I have one 1 in my hand. The remaining two players have 16 digits. The expected number of 1s in those 16 digits is 1.6, making the total expected count 2.6. The probability of the total being less than 4 is ~79%, which is high enough to justify challenging. Bidding higher risks being challenged with uncertain outcomes.

Player 4 Reasoning: Since this is a new round and I am the first to bid with 16 total digits, I should make a conservative opening bid. I have two 0s and two 1s. Bidding one of either seems reasonable. I'll bid 2 0s to start.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s, which seems low given the remaining total digits (16). I have 3, 7, 4, 8, 3, and 8 in my hand, which includes two 8s. I can bid 3 8s to increase both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. I could bid 3 9s, but that's not much higher. I could also bid 4 of something. Given the game history, Player 1 seems willing to bid aggressively. Since I have two 0s, and the previous bid was 2 0s, I will bid 4 0s.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have one 4 in my hand. Since there are 16 total digits and only one other player, the maximum number of 4s is 16. It is plausible that there are at least four 4s. I have two 0s in my hand. I will bid 5 0s, which is a valid increase and uses my hand information.
