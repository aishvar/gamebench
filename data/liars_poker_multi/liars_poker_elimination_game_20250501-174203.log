Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so I can bid anything. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 1 9s is a safe starting bid, as it's likely at least one 9 exists amongst the 48 digits. It's a conservative approach to start the round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 1 9s, I need to make a strictly higher bid. Since I have no 9s in my hand but do have other digits, I should consider bidding on a digit I have, trying to balance the risk of being challenged with the potential of making a valid bid. My hand contains 81705902, which means I have at least one of each of these digits. Bidding on a digit I have, like 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, could be reasonable, but since I must bid higher than 1 9s, I could either increase the quantity of 9s (which I don't have) or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. However, since I don't have any 9s and increasing the quantity of a digit I don't have is risky, I should look for a digit that is higher than 9, which isn't possible since 9 is the highest digit, or bid the same quantity with a higher digit, which also isn't possible since 9 is the highest. Thus, my safest option is to increase the quantity of a digit that I do have. Considering I have one 8, bidding 2 8s seems like a reasonable and safe increase, given it's higher than the current bid and I have at least one 8 to back it up.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s made by Player 1. I have the digits 4, 2, 7, 2, 8, 8, 0, and 3 in my hand. This means there are at least 2 8s in total (my own). Given that the bid is only 2 8s, I can make a higher bid by increasing either the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 8s and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48, I can reasonably bid a higher quantity or a higher digit. I will bid 3 8s as it is a straightforward increase in quantity and I have the digits to support part of that claim.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand. The current bid of 3 8s can be surpassed by bidding 4 1s, which is likely given the expected total of 4.8 1s across all players. This bid leverages my strong holding in 1s while staying within reasonable statistical probability.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 04478902, which contains no 1s. The current bid is 4 1s by Player 3. With 48 total digits across 6 players, an average of 4.8 of each digit is expected. A bid of 4 1s is slightly below average and plausible, but since I have none, I estimate the likelihood is lower. However, challenging now is risky as it's still early in the bidding, and others might have 1s. Iâ€™ll make a higher bid instead. I have two 4s, so bidding 5 4s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit, and aligns with my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. The current bid is 5 4s across all 48 digits. To evaluate whether to challenge or bid higher, I need to consider the probability. With 6 players having 8 digits each (48 total), and assuming random distribution, each digit would appear about 4.8 times on average. The bid of 5 4s is very close to this average, making it quite plausible. Since I already know of one 4 in my hand, there would need to be at least 4 more 4s among the other players' 40 digits, which is reasonable. I'll make a higher bid instead of challenging. I could bid 6 4s, but that's getting riskier. Instead, I'll bid 5 5s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit. I have two 5s in my hand, which gives me more confidence in this bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have zero 5s in my hand. Given that there are 6 players with 8 digits each (48 total), it's plausible, but not incredibly likely. However, I can bid 6 5s which is a valid higher bid. Alternatively, I could challenge, but with 48 digits total, 5 5s isn't *that* unreasonable. I have two 9s, so I could bid higher on 9s, but that's less likely to be true for others. Bidding 6 5s is the most strategic move, as it increases the quantity while keeping the digit the same. It's a reasonable bluff.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 6 5s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have one 5 and one 9 in my hand (81705902), and considering the bids made so far, increasing the quantity seems more feasible than increasing the digit, as higher digits might be less frequent. However, with 48 total digits and 6 players, each having 8 digits, the distribution of digits could be quite varied. The previous bids suggest a mix of strategies, from focusing on higher digits like 8 and 9 to lower digits like 1 and 4. My hand doesn't give me a clear advantage in any specific digit, but I should consider the probability of certain digits appearing. Given that 5s have already been bid up to 6, and without clear insight into other players' hands, bidding on a higher digit or slightly increasing the quantity of 5s could be risky. But since I must bid higher, and given the lack of information suggesting an abundance of any single digit, a cautious approach would be to slightly increase the quantity of a digit that has been previously bid or move to a higher digit with a lower quantity if it seems plausible. However, since my hand contains a 9 and given the initial bid was for 9s, it might indicate 9s are somewhat scarce or players are avoiding them due to their high value. Thus, considering a balance between the risk of challenging and the uncertainty of bidding, challenging the current bid of 6 5s might be the safer option, especially if I believe the actual count of 5s could be lower than 6, given the diverse bidding history.

Player 1 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None' and I have two 0s and other digits in my hand, I can make an initial bid. Since the game has just started with 5 players and 40 total digits, it's reasonable to start with a low quantity and a digit I have in my hand. I have one 1, one 7, one 8, one 9, two 0s, one 5, one 2, and one 6 in my hand. Bidding on a digit I have, like 1, seems like a safe start because it's a low quantity and a relatively low digit, making it less likely to be challenged immediately.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 1s made by Player 1. I have one 1 in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 40 digits. Bidding 2 1s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity while considering my own hand. However, I should also consider the possibility of challenging, but given my hand and the low bid, increasing the bid seems more prudent.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand. Since the current bid is 2 1s and I have three myself, challenging would be risky because the actual count is at least three. Therefore, raising the bid to 3 1s is a safe and logical move, leveraging the high quantity of 1s in my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 04478902, which contains no 1s. The current bid is 3 1s by Player 3. With 40 total digits across 5 players, it's possible that there are at least 3 1s in play, as I have none, meaning they could be distributed among the other players. Bidding higher seems safer than challenging at this low quantity. I have two 4s in my hand, so bidding 4 4s feels reasonableâ€”it increases both the quantity and the digit, and I contribute to the count myself.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand, I have two 4s (94475263). The current bid is 4 4s from Player 4. Since there are 5 active players with 8 digits each (40 total digits), and I know I have 2 of the 4s, there would need to be at least 2 more 4s among the other players' hands for the bid to be valid. This is certainly possible, but not guaranteed. I could challenge, but it's a risky move since the bid is quite reasonable. Alternatively, I could increase the bid. Since I have two 5s in my hand, bidding on 5s might be strategic. I'll bid 4 5s, which is higher than 4 4s because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity.

Player 1 Reasoning: Considering the current bid is 4 5s and I have one 5 in my hand (81705902), increasing the quantity to 5 while keeping the same digit seems reasonable. Given that there are 40 total digits remaining and 5 players, each with 8 digits, it's plausible that there could be at least 5 fives among all players. Since my hand contains a 5, it supports the possibility of reaching this quantity. Therefore, bidding 5 5s is a logical step, increasing the quantity while maintaining the same digit as the current bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s made by Player 1. I have the hand 42728803, which contains two 8s and one 5, along with other digits. Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should consider my available digits and the bids made so far. Given that I have one 5 in my hand and the bid is 5 5s, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. I can see that bidding higher on a different digit might be more feasible. For example, bidding on 8s could be strategic since I have two 8s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. With 40 total digits remaining and my hand containing no 8s, the probability of 6 eights existing across the remaining 4 players' hands (32 digits) is low.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s made by Player 3. In my hand, I have no 1s, which means I contribute nothing to the count of 1s. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 4 1s seems plausible as it requires only about 1 '1' per player on average. I don't have strong evidence to challenge this bid as it is not excessively high. Instead, I will make a higher bid. I have two 4s in my hand, so bidding on 4s seems reasonable. I will bid 5 4s, increasing the quantity from 4 to 5 and switching to a digit I have some strength in. This bid is still within a believable range given the total digits.

Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of '5 4s' made by Player 4. Looking at my hand (94475263), I have two 4s. For there to be at least 5 fours total, the other three players would need to have at least 3 more 4s among them, which is certainly possible. Given that Player 4 made this bid, they likely have at least one 4 themselves. I could challenge, but it's a risky move as the bid is quite reasonable. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding on 5s would be strategic. I could bid '5 5s' (same quantity but higher digit) or '6 4s' (higher quantity). Since I have two 5s already, I'll go with '5 5s' as it has a better chance of being true based on my knowledge.

Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 5s by Player 5, I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. My hand contains 81705902, which has no 5s. Since I don't have any 5s and considering the total number of digits remaining is 32, it seems unlikely that there are at least 5 5s among all players. However, challenging the bid '5 5s' requires careful consideration because if the bid is valid, I would be eliminated. On the other hand, making a bid higher than '5 5s' means I have to either increase the quantity or the digit. Given my hand, I see that I have one 6 and no other digits that appear more than once. Increasing the digit seems more feasible than the quantity, given the constraints of the game and the information available.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 04478902, which contains no 5s. The current bid by Player 3 is 4 5s across all 24 digits in play among the three active players. Since I have no 5s, the bid relies entirely on the other two players having at least 4 5s combined in their 16 digits. Given the history of bids and challenges, where high bids on specific digits have often been challenged successfully, I think 4 5s might be a stretch, but not impossible. However, I can make a safer bid by increasing the quantity or digit. I have two 4s, so bidding 5 4s could be plausible, but since 5 4s is not higher than 4 5s in terms of digit, I need to bid higher. Iâ€™ll bid 5 7s since I have one 7 in my hand, and it increases both the quantity and the digit from the current bid, making it a valid and strategic move without overreaching.

Player 5 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '5 7s'. Looking at my hand (94475263), I have only one 7. For there to be 5 sevens total, Player 3 and Player 4 would need to have 4 more sevens between them. With 8 digits per player, it's possible but not guaranteed. Given that Player 4 made this bid, they likely have at least 1-2 sevens themselves. I could bid '6 7s', but that would be risky. I could also bid '5 8s' or '5 9s', but I only have one 9 and zero 8s in my hand. The safest option is to bid '6 0s', '6 1s', '6 2s', '6 3s', or '6 4s' since I have at least one of each of these digits in my hand. Since I have two 4s, bidding '6 4s' seems most reasonable, as I'm accounting for 2 of the needed 6 myself.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid of 6 4s seems highly improbable given the average distribution of digits. With 24 total digits remaining, the expected count for any specific digit (like 4) is around 2.4.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have three 1s and three 5s in my hand. Since Player 4 has 8 digits, bidding 4 1s is a logical starting point. This bid assumes Player 4 has at least one 1, which is plausible given the distribution of digits. Bidding on a digit I already have multiple instances of increases the likelihood of the bid being valid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 04478902, which contains two 4s, one 0, one 2, one 7, one 8, and one 9, but no 1s. The current bid by Player 3 is 4 1s. Since I have no 1s, I must consider whether 4 1s is likely across the total 16 digits. With only two players, it's possible Player 3 has several 1s, but I don't know their hand. Bidding higher is safer than challenging at this point. I can bid 5 4s since I have two 4s myself, making it somewhat plausible that there are three more 4s in Player 3's hand. This increases the quantity and changes the digit, adhering to the rules of a higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 4 in my hand. For Player 4's bid of 5 4s to be valid, they would need at least four 4s in their hand, which is statistically unlikely given an 8-digit hand. Challenging this bid capitalizes on the improbability of such a high concentration of 4s in their hand.
