Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since this is the first bid, I can bid any valid quantity and digit. I have two 8s, one 9, one 6, one 4, one 3 and one 1 in my hand. Bidding 1 8s is a conservative but valid opening bid, leveraging the 8s I possess. It's better to start with a lower bid to gauge the other players' hands.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 8s made by Player 0. My hand contains one 8, meaning the total count of 8s across all players is at least one. Therefore, the bid 1 8s is guaranteed to be true, and I cannot challenge it. I must make a higher bid. A higher bid requires either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. My hand contains two 4s. Bidding 2 4s is a valid higher bid (quantity 2 is higher than quantity 1) and is guaranteed to be true based on my hand. This is a safe and reasonable strategic move to increase the bid quantity.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 4s. I have no 4s in my hand, but I can try to bid on a different digit. I have a 2 and two 1s, so I can bid on the digit 1, which has a higher quantity in my hand. Bidding 3 1s seems reasonable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: My hand contains two 5s. The current bid is 3 1s. Bidding 3 5s is a valid higher bid since the digit 5 is higher than 1, even though the quantity remains the same. This leverages my existing digits without overreaching.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:2 - o3-2025-04-16) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. With 48 total digits in play, the average count for any digit is close to five, so the chance that there are at least three 6s overall is very high. By keeping the quantity at three but moving the digit from 5 to 6, I legally outbid Player 3 while maintaining a safe, low-risk bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. The current bid is '3 6s', meaning Player 4 claims there are at least 3 sixes among all players' hands. Looking at my own hand (23745220), I have 0 sixes. With 6 players having 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. Since I don't have any 6s, all 3 (or more) would need to be in the other players' hands. This is certainly possible as the average occurrence of each digit would be 4.8 per digit. I could either challenge or make a higher bid. For a higher bid, I could bid '4 6s' (increasing quantity), '3 7s' (same quantity, higher digit), or something else. Since I have two 7s in my hand, bidding '3 7s' seems reasonable and safe.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have no 7s in my hand, and the previous bids have been relatively conservative. Bidding 4 7s would be a reasonable increase, but I suspect it might be too high. I have two 8s, so bidding 2 8s is a safe option, increasing the digit while staying relatively conservative. However, given the previous bids, a slight increase in quantity with the same digit is also plausible. Considering I have no 7s, I'll bid 4 7s to try and bluff, hoping others don't have many 7s either.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average expected count for any digit is 4.8. The bid of 4 7s is close to this average, making a challenge risky. My hand contains two 4s. The expected total count of 4s across all players is approximately 2 (mine) + 4 (expected from others) = 6. Bidding 5 4s is a valid higher bid than 4 7s (higher quantity) and is well supported by my hand and the statistical expectation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s made by Player 1. I have two 6s and one 4 in my hand. Given that Player 4 previously bid 3 6s, it's likely that the digit 6 is less common than 4. I should increase the quantity for digit 4, as it's the most likely to be higher than the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 4s. My hand contains no 4s, and the expected total number of 4s across all players is 4.8 (based on 48 digits with 10 possible values). This makes the bid of 6 4s statistically unlikely. Challenging it could expose a bluff, as the actual count may fall short.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I already see one 1 in my own hand, so the bid of 3 1s is very plausible and challenging would be dangerous. I’ll instead raise by keeping the quantity at 3 but moving to the highest digit. I hold one 9; with 32 unknown digits spread among four opponents, the chance that at least two more 9s exist is high (about 84% under a uniform distribution). Bidding 3 9s is therefore safe for me and forces the next player to increase the quantity on their turn.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (23745220), I have no 9s. Player 4 has bid 3 9s, meaning they believe there are at least 3 nines among all 40 digits. With 5 active players having 8 digits each, this is certainly possible. However, since I have zero 9s in my hand, all 3 (or more) must be in the other players' hands. I could challenge, but it's a risky move as 3 is a relatively low quantity. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have two 0s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid on 0s. I'll bid 4 0s, increasing the quantity while switching to a digit I actually have.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. I have zero 0s in my hand. Bidding higher than 4 0s is risky, as it's unlikely there are many 0s remaining among the other players. Given the game history and the limited number of digits remaining (40), challenging seems like the best option. Player 5 may be bluffing.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, so I can bid anything. I have two 8s and one 9 in my hand. Bidding 2 8s seems like a reasonable starting point, given my hand. It's a low risk bid that could potentially be successful.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have two 4s in my hand. Bidding 3 4s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and is supported by my hand, requiring only one additional 4 from the other players. Challenging 2 8s is risky as I have one 8 and the expected total count across 32 digits is likely to be 2 or more.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s made by Player 1. I have one 4 in my hand, which is not a strong basis for a higher bid. However, I can safely make a bid with a higher quantity and digit, as I don't have any reason to believe the current bid is invalid. I have three 1s in my hand, so I can bid 4 1s.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:2 - o3-2025-04-16) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I only have one 1, so I’m not confident that there are four 1s in total. Player 2 has been consistently bidding on 1s, suggesting they may hold several, which makes a direct challenge risky. Instead, I’ll raise the bid while keeping the quantity at 4 but jumping the digit to 9. I hold one 9 myself, so we’d need only three more 9s among the remaining 24 hidden digits; the probability of that (≈44%) is comparable to the current bid’s likelihood, yet picking the highest digit forces the next player to move the quantity up to at least 5, a far tougher threshold. This applies pressure to my opponents without exposing me to the immediate elimination risk of a challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 5 9s would be a reasonable increase in quantity. However, given that there are only 32 total digits remaining across 4 players, and we've already seen several bids, 5 9s seems risky. I could also bid on a different digit, but I don't have a strong hand in any other digit to confidently raise the bid. Therefore, challenging the current bid of 4 9s is the more strategic move. It's unlikely there are four 9s in total, given the game history and my own hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. My hand contains two 4s. Bidding 3 4s is a valid higher bid and is strongly supported by my hand, as I only need one additional 4 from the other two players (16 total digits) for the bid to be true, which is highly probable. Challenging the current bid of 2 8s, made by Player 0, is riskier as Player 0 likely has at least one 8 and has shown a willingness to challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s. I have two 8s in my hand, and the previous bids have shown a willingness to bid high on 4s. Bidding 5 4s would be a reasonable bluff, as it's a direct increase in quantity. However, given that Player 1 just bid 3 4s and Player 2 followed with 4 4s, it's likely they both have a good number of 4s. I have no 4s in my hand. Bidding higher on 4s feels risky. Instead, I can bid 3 8s. This increases the digit and is a plausible bid given I have two 8s, and it's less likely others are heavily invested in 8s.

Player 1 Reasoning: Player 2 bid 3 4s. I have two 4s in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. Bidding 4 4s is a valid higher bid (quantity 4 > quantity 3). This bid claims there are at least four 4s in total. Since I have two 4s, this requires Player 2 to have at least two 4s as well (2 + at least 2 = at least 4). This is a plausible scenario, especially considering Player 2 just bid 3 4s, suggesting they have some confidence in the number of 4s. Challenging 3 4s is risky; I only win if Player 2 has zero 4s (total 2), but lose if they have one or more (total 3+). Bidding 4 4s is a reasonable escalation based on my hand and the current bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 4s made by Player 1. I have two 4s in my hand. I can bid 4 4s, matching the digit but increasing the quantity to the maximum possible, which is 8. However, I should also consider bidding 5 4s, increasing the quantity further. Since the current bid is 4 4s, I can safely bid 5 4s without being challenged, as it's a higher quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. There are 16 total digits in play (8 in my hand, 8 in Player 2's hand). My hand contains two 4s. For the bid of 5 4s to be true, Player 2's hand must contain at least 5 - 2 = 3 4s. The probability of a player having 3 or more of a specific digit in a hand of 8 digits is relatively low (using binomial probability, P(>=3 4s in 8 digits) is about 3.8%). The expected number of 4s in 16 digits is 1.6. A bid of 5 is significantly higher than the expected count. Based on the low probability that Player 2 holds enough 4s to make the bid true, challenging is the most strategic move.
