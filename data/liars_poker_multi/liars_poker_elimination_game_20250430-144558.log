Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have a 2 in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start by bidding a small quantity and a digit that is present in my hand. Bidding 1 2s is a reasonable starting point.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 2s. My hand is 50545581, which contains one 5 and no 2s. I have a total of 8 digits, and there's a total of 48 digits among all players. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 2s, and there's only one 2 bid, it seems plausible that there might be at least one or two 2s or more among other players. However, I can increase the bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. A reasonable next bid could be to increase the digit, so bidding 1 3s is a valid and cautious next step.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:5 - google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. I can either bid higher or challenge. Bidding 2 3s is a valid option, but it doesn't gain much information. Bidding on a digit I have could be better, but I only have one of each digit other than 9. Since the previous bid was only 1, challenging seems reasonable as it's unlikely there are even 1 3 in all the other hands. I will challenge to try and eliminate Player 1.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None' as it's the start of the round and I am Player 1, who starts the bidding. I have the hand 50545581, which contains four 5s. A reasonable starting bid should be conservative but also take into account the digits I see. Since I have four 5s, bidding on 5s seems reasonable. I will start with a low quantity to avoid being too aggressive.

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:3 - deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. The current bid is 4 5s, which means at least three more 5s would need to be among the other four players' hands (32 digits total). This seems plausible but not certain. I can either bid higher or challenge. Since the current bid is relatively low, I can safely increase the bid to 4 6s, which is a higher digit and still reasonable given the total digits in play.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 5 6s increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 6 while pushing the total count higher, making it a strategic move to challenge the current bid's feasibility.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 1 0s, which is a very low quantity and digit. I have a 0 in my hand, which gives me some confidence. However, I don't have any other 0s, and the total digits remaining are 32, which is a relatively small number. Considering this, bidding 2 0s seems like a reasonable move, as it's a higher quantity and digit than the current bid.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:1 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. My hand is 50545581, which contains one 0. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since there are 32 total digits and the current bid is 2 0s, it's plausible that there are more than 2 0s given that I have one. However, increasing the quantity might be risky. I can bid 2 1s, which is a higher digit and seems reasonable given the distribution.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand (from 27617462). The current bid is 2 1s, which is already matching the count in my hand. Since there are three other players, it's possible that the total count is higher. I can increase the bid to 3 1s to reflect this possibility and keep the game going.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s. I have one 0 in my hand (50545581). To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since there are 24 total digits and 2 0s are already bid, I should assess the likelihood of having more 0s or a higher digit. I see I have one 0, and there are 16 digits left in other players' hands. It's possible they have more 0s, but bidding 3 0s might be too aggressive. Bidding a higher digit with the same quantity is a safer option. I can bid 2 1s. I have one 1 in my hand, so it's plausible others have at least one more 1.
