Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I can start by bidding on the total number of 7s. I have two 7s in my hand, so a bid of 2 7s is safe and reasonable. Bidding 2 7s sets a baseline for the game and is unlikely to be challenged immediately.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. With 40 unknown digits likely containing around four more 7s, bidding 3 7s is a safe, valid increase over the current 2 7s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 7 and one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid because it maintains the same quantity (3) but increases the digit (8 > 7), leveraging my existing 8.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to bid higher than '3 9s' or challenge it. Looking at my hand (28492141), I don't have any 9s. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For the bid '3 9s' to be valid, at least 3 of the 48 digits need to be 9s. Given that I have 0 nines and the other 5 players have 40 digits combined, it's certainly possible that 3 or more of those digits are 9s. The probability isn't extremely low. I could challenge, but it seems risky. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. I have one 0, so I could bid '4 0s', meaning I believe there are at least 4 zeros among all players. This is a reasonable bid since I already have one 0 in my hand, and I only need 3 more among the other 40 digits to make this bid valid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s by Player 4. I have one '0' in my hand. The previous bids showed increasing counts of 7s, 8s, and 9s, but now the bid jumped to 4 0s, which is a higher quantity and a lower digit than 9, but valid since quantity increased. Given that there are 48 digits total and 4 zeros is plausible, I can safely increase the bid. I have one '5' and two '8's in my hand, so bidding 4 5s is a reasonable next step, as it is higher than 4 0s (same quantity, higher digit).

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. To beat this, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. I have one 5 in my hand, so I can't confidently bid 5 5s, which would require at least 5 fives across all players. The highest possible total for 5s is 6 (since there are 6 players), but I have only one 5, making 5 5s highly unlikely. Bidding 4 6s or higher would require me to have more sixes, which I do not. Alternatively, I can challenge the bid, as the total number of 5s across all hands is unlikely to be 4 or more, given my hand and the total digits. Challenging seems the safest move.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have the digits 5, 0, 2, 5, 5, 8, 6, 3 in my hand. Notably, I have three 5s. Since no bids have been made yet this round, I want to start with a bid that reflects a reasonable quantity and digit. Bidding '3 5s' is a solid starting point because I have three 5s myself, making it plausible that there are at least three 5s among all players' digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand and only need one more among the 32 unknown digits. The probability of at least one additional 7 is about 96.6%, so raising to 3 7s is a very safe move above 3 5s.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains three 6s. Since the current bid is None, starting with a bid that reflects my hand's strength is logical. Bidding 3 6s leverages the quantity of 6s I hold, providing a reasonable and defensible initial bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '3 6s'. Looking at my hand (28492141), I have zero 6s. Since there are 4 active players with 8 digits each (32 total digits), and I don't have any 6s, there would need to be at least 3 sixes among the other 24 digits. This is definitely possible, with a probability around 3/10 if digits are randomly distributed. Given that I have no 6s to contribute to this count, I should make a higher bid. I have one 7, so bidding '3 7s' would be reasonable - I'm contributing 1, and need only 2 more among the other players. I also have two 4s, two 1s, and one each of 2, 8, and 9, but bidding on 7s seems most strategic at this point as it's just incrementing the digit from the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 5, one 2, one 5, one 5, one 8, one 6, and three other digits in my hand, but no 7s. Since the bid is 3 7s, and I don't have any 7s, I must consider if bidding higher is reasonable. The next higher bid after 3 7s is 3 8s or 4 0s. Bidding 3 8s is reasonable because I have one 8 in my hand, and the total digits are 32, so 3 8s is plausible. Bidding 4 0s is also possible but riskier since I have no 0s. Therefore, I will bid 3 8s to raise the bid slightly with a digit I hold.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 8 and one 9. Challenging 3 8s is unwise: with 32 digits total and 1 in my hand, thereâ€™s ~70% chance of at least two more 8s among the other 24 unknown digits. Instead I should raise the digit at the same quantity. I hold one 9, and the chance of at least two more 9s among the others is also about 70%, so bidding 3 9s is reasonable and forces the next player to increase the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (28492141), I have zero 6s. Player 2 has bid 4 6s, meaning they believe there are at least 4 sixes among all 32 digits. Since I don't have any 6s, all 4 would need to come from the other three players. While this is possible, it seems somewhat risky. In previous rounds, Player 2 has shown a pattern of bidding 3 8s and now 4 6s, which might indicate they're comfortable making aggressive bids. Given that I have one 7 in my hand, I could bid 4 7s to increase the digit while keeping the same quantity. Alternatively, I could increase to 5 6s, but that's riskier since I don't have any 6s myself. I think the safest move is to bid 4 7s since I have evidence of at least one 7 in my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I must bid higher either by increasing the quantity or by bidding 4 of a digit higher than 7. I have one 7 in my hand, and one 8. Bidding 4 8s is a valid and reasonable increment. It is not an excessively high bid considering the total of 32 digits in play, and I have some support in my hand for the digit 8.

Player 4 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation carefully. My hand is 28492141, which contains 0 sixes. The current bid is 3 6s, meaning Player 2 is claiming there are at least 3 sixes among all players' hands. Since I have 0 sixes, this means Player 2 and Player 5 would need to have at least 3 sixes between them. Each player has 8 digits, so it's certainly possible. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, one 2, one 4, one 8, one 9, and two 4s. I could bid 3 7s, but I only have 0 sevens in my hand, which makes it risky. I could bid 4 1s since I have 2 ones, but that's a significant increase in quantity. Given that I have no sixes in my hand and Player 2 is claiming at least 3 exist, I think challenging is reasonable. If Player 2 and Player 5 have fewer than 3 sixes combined, I win the challenge.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand.

Increasing the digit to 7 or higher with the same quantity is possible. I have no 7s or higher digits in my hand, but bidding 4 7s is the minimal valid increase and still plausible. Challenging now might be risky since the previous bid was only 4 of a digit, which is not excessively high. I will bid 4 7s to continue the game conservatively.
