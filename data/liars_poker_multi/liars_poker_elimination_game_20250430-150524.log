Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I should make a conservative but reasonable opening bid based on my hand. I have two 9s, two 5s, two 6s, one 3, and one 0. With 6 players and 8 digits each, each digit is likely to appear about 4.8 times on average. Since I have two 9s, starting with '2 9s' is safe and gives me some control over the bidding direction.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 49817722, I have no 9s. The current bid of '2 9s' is relatively low considering there are 6 players with 8 digits each (48 total digits). Even though I don't have any 9s, it's quite possible that 2 or more 9s exist among the other 40 digits I can't see. Looking at my hand, I notice I have three 2s, which gives me confidence to make a higher bid. I can safely bid '3 2s' since I already see three 2s just in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 2 in my hand. The current bid is 3 2s. Bidding 4 2s increases the quantity, which is a valid move. Even though I only have one 2, others may have more, making this a reasonable bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand, and the current bid is 4 2s. Bidding 4 3s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, leveraging my two 3s and making it harder for others to have fewer 3s than 2s. This is a defensible higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. I have zero 3s in my hand. It's unlikely that there are four 3s across all players, given that we've already seen bids for 9s and 2s, and there are only 48 total digits. Challenging seems like the best course of action.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: As the starting player, I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 2s, two 3s, and two 5s. Bidding 3 2s is reasonable because I already have two, and there's a good chance another player has at least one 2. This bid balances quantity and digit value while aligning with my hand's composition.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I hold two 3s in my eight digits. The current bid is 3 2s. To beat this, I can keep the quantity at 3 and move the digit up to 3. With two 3s already, I only need one more 3 among the 32 unknown digits; the chance of at least one appearing is very high (well over 95%). Challenging the existing bid would be risky, since the probability that there are at least three 2s in 40 digits is also quite high. Therefore, making a modest, safe raise to 3 3s is the best move.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 59909365, which contains one 3. The current bid is 3 3s. With 5 players and 40 digits in play, it's plausible there are at least 3 threes, so challenging is not optimal. To make a valid higher bid, I can either increase the quantity to 4 for any digit, or bid 3 4s or higher. My hand contains three 9s, so bidding 3 9s is strong, but the rules require strictly higher than 3 3s, so 3 9s is valid. I will bid 3 9s, leveraging my strong hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (49817722), I have no 9s. The current bid of '3 9s' requires at least 3 nines among all 40 digits. While possible, I can make a safer bid based on what I see in my hand. I have three 2s, and previous bidding history shows others likely have 2s as well (earlier bids of '3 2s' and '4 2s'). A bid of '4 2s' would be valid as it increases the quantity, and I'm confident in this bid since I already see three 2s in my own hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. My hand contains one 2, but I can bid a higher digit with the same quantity. Bidding 4 3s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, which is a valid move. This allows me to stay in the game without overcommitting.

Player 3 Reasoning: The previous bid of 4 3s was validated with an actual count of 5 in the prior round. My hand contains two 3s, and with four other active players, it's plausible there are at least three more 3s in their hands. Bidding 5 3s increases the quantity while maintaining the same digit, leveraging the prior successful count and my own holdings.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I hold one 4. Among the 32 unseen digits (4 other players × 8), the expected number of 4s is about 3.2. The chance that there are at least four more 4s (so the total is 5 or more) is roughly 40%, which is acceptable. By keeping the quantity at 5 and only increasing the digit from 3 to 4, I make the smallest legal raise, leaving less incentive for an immediate challenge while still outbidding Player 3.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 4s. In my hand (59909365), I have zero 4s, so I cannot directly support the current bid. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid the same quantity with a higher digit. I have three 9s in my hand, which is a strong holding. Given that there are 40 digits total and I hold 3 of the 9s, it's plausible that there are at least 5 9s among all players. Therefore, I will bid 5 9s, which is strictly higher than 5 4s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid of 5 9s is very risky. I can see my hand (49817722) has zero 9s, and with 5 players having 8 digits each (40 total), we need 5 nines. Given I see none, and 9 is a relatively uncommon digit, it's unlikely the other 4 players have 5 or more 9s between them. The previous bidding pattern also suggests players are more comfortable with lower digits (2s and 3s). This bid seems too high to be true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the starting bidder in this round with no current bid, I want to make an opening bid based on my hand. My hand contains three 9s and one of each of 5, 6, and 0. Since I have three 9s, bidding 2 9s is safe and conservative, but since players have seen me open with 2 9s previously, I should consider a slightly stronger opening to avoid being too predictable. Bidding 3 9s leverages my strong hand and puts some pressure on the other players.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid because the quantity (4) is greater than the current bid's quantity (3), even though the digit (8) is lower than 9. This leverages my hand's 8s while adhering to the bid rules.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand contains no 8s, and with three other players each holding 8 digits, the expected number of 8s is low (around 2.4). Bidding higher (e.g., 4 9s or 5 8s) introduces more risk given my lack of relevant digits. Challenging the bid is statistically favorable, as the actual count is likely below 4.

Player 3 Reasoning: As the first bidder in the round, I need to make a reasonable initial bid. My hand contains two 2s, two 3s, and two 5s. Bidding 3 2s is a safe starting point since I have two, and it's likely there's at least one more in the other players' hands. This bid is conservative but plausible given the total digits (24) and my knowledge of my own hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: I hold two 3s. The current bid is 3 2s. By raising to 3 3s I only need one additional 3 among the 16 unknown digits, which is quite likely (≈81% chance).

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s. Looking at my hand (59909365), I have no 3s. Since there are 24 digits in play and I hold 8, the other two players have 16 digits combined. While it's certainly possible there are at least 3 total 3s among all hands, it's not so high that a challenge is warranted yet. I should make a higher bid. I have three 9s, which is strong. Bidding 3 9s is a legal and safe increment, since I know for sure there are at least 3 9s (all in my hand).

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s by Player 0. My hand contains no 9s, making it unlikely the total 9s across all players meet this bid. However, challenging carries risk if others have multiple 9s. Instead, I will increase the quantity to 4 and choose a digit from my hand (3s) to create a plausible bid. With two 3s in my hand and 16 digits remaining in others' hands, 4 3s is a safer and higher bid than 3 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I hold one 9. Player 0 has repeatedly bid on 9s in every round, suggesting he is likely sitting on several 9s again. If he has even two and I have one, only one more 9 is needed among Player 3’s eight digits for there to be at least four 9s total, which is quite plausible. Challenging 4 3s is unsafe—I already see two 3s in my own hand, so the bid is probably correct. Raising the quantity to 5 of any digit would make me an easy target for an immediate challenge. Therefore, the safest strict over-bid is to keep the quantity at four but move the digit up to 9, taking advantage of the apparent abundance of 9s and reducing the chance that Player 0 will challenge.

Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 59909365, which contains three 9s. The current bid is 4 9s, and there are 24 digits in play. I know there are three 9s in my hand, so only one more 9 would be needed among the other 16 digits for the bid to be valid. This is quite likely, so challenging is too risky. The next valid bid is 5 0s, 5 1s, ..., or 5 9s. My hand contains two 0s, which is a strong holding for 0s. Bidding 5 0s leverages my hand strength and is less likely to be challenged than 5 9s, since I just bid aggressively on 9s earlier. Therefore, I will bid 5 0s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s made by Player 0. My hand contains no 0s, and the total digits remaining are 24. Since I have 8 digits with no 0s, the remaining 16 digits (held by two players) must account for all 0s. The expected number of 0s in 16 random digits is 1.6 per player, totaling ~3.2. A bid of 5 0s is statistically unlikely unless the other players have an unusually high concentration of 0s. Challenging this bid risks elimination if the count is ≥5, but the probability of the count being <5 is higher given the expected distribution. This makes challenging the optimal move.

Player 3 Reasoning: As the starting player, I need to make the first bid. My hand contains two 2s, two 3s, and two 5s.

Player 5 Reasoning: Across the 16 total digits only 3 twos are required. I can account for one of them, leaving Player 3 needing at least two more. For a random 8-digit hand the probability of having two or more twos is roughly 19%. Player 3 has opened with the same ‘3 2s’ bid in earlier rounds and has never been challenged, so this is a convenient bluff point rather than evidence they really hold several twos—especially now that there are only two players and the overall chance of 3 twos existing has dropped to about 21%. With the odds strongly favoring the bid being false, challenging gives me the best chance to win the match outright.
