Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 4, one 6, one 9, one 0, one 8, and one 1 in my hand. Since there are 48 digits in total and no bids yet, starting with a moderate bid like '2 4s' is reasonable because 4 appears once in my hand and it's a common digit. This sets a baseline for others to respond to.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. The current bid of 2 fours is highly likely to be true given the expected number of fours among the other hands; challenging is unwise. Raising to 3 sixes is safe since I hold three and it’s a valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid is 3 6s, which means there needs to be at least two more 6s among the other five players. With 40 digits left in other players' hands, it's possible but not certain. I can either bid higher or challenge. Since I have two 5s in my hand, I can increase the bid to 3 8s, which is a higher digit than 6, making it a valid bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 2. Considering the total digits remaining (48), it's quite plausible that there could be at least 4 8s in total, especially given the small number of players and the relatively low quantity of the current bid. I'll make a strategic bid to increase the quantity and digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid of 4 9s is slightly below the expected count of 4.8 9s across all 48 digits, making it statistically likely to be valid. Challenging would risk elimination. My hand contains two 0s, two 2s, and two 5s. Bidding 5 0s leverages a digit I have multiple copies of and aligns with the statistical likelihood that the total count for 0s (expected 4.8) could meet or exceed 5.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 5 0s, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. Since I have one 6 in my hand (64517209), and considering the bids made so far, increasing the quantity seems like a safer bet than changing the digit, as the digit 0 has been bid high already. However, I also notice that the digit 1 appears twice in my hand, which could indicate a higher presence of 1s across all players. Given that no one has bid on 1s yet, and considering the distribution of my own hand, bidding on 1s could be a strategic move, especially since it's a lower digit that hasn't been targeted. Thus, bidding on 6 1s seems reasonable, as it increases the quantity from the last bid and targets a digit that hasn't been bid on, potentially giving me an advantage.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 1s, which means there are at least six 1s among all players' hands. I have one '1' in my hand. The previous bids show a steady increase in quantity and digit values, so bidding higher than 6 1s is necessary. The next valid bid could be 6 2s or 7 of any digit. I don't have any '2's, but I do have one '4' and one '6'. Bidding 7 1s would be risky since I only have one '1'. Bidding 6 2s is a minimal increment but I don't have '2's. Bidding 7 0s might be plausible since I have one '0' in my hand, and increasing the quantity is a strong move. Given that 7 is only one more than 6 and 0 is a low digit, bidding 7 0s is a reasonable choice.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have zero 0s in my hand and the other 40 digits (5 players) are expected to contain about 4 zeros (sd≈1.9). A claim of at least 7 zeros in total has under a 10% chance of being true, so it's very unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 6s in my hand. With 32 other hidden digits, the expected number of sixes among them is about 3.2, giving an expected total of ~6.2. Bidding 5 sixes is a conservative, yet strong, opening bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand (from 94555800). The current bid is 5 6s, which means there would need to be at least four more 6s among the other four players' hands (total of 32 digits). Given that 6 is a moderately common digit, this seems plausible but risky. To avoid a challenge, I can bid higher by increasing the digit to 7, keeping the quantity the same. I don't have any 7s in my hand, but this is a safer move than challenging.

Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '2 2s' by Player 4 and my hand being '64517209', I notice I have one '2' in my hand. Considering there are 32 total digits remaining and 4 active players, each having 8 digits, the maximum possible count for any digit is 32. Since the current bid is relatively low and I have a '2' in my hand, increasing the quantity to '3 2s' seems like a reasonable move, as it's not overly ambitious given the total number of digits in play. This bid is strictly higher than the current bid, adhering to the game's rules.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 3s. My hand (56082502) contains no 3s. With 32 total digits remaining across 4 players, the average count per digit is ~3.2. Since 3s are not in my hand and the average distribution suggests fewer than 4 3s likely exist, challenging seems optimal. Player 3's bid of 4 3s likely overstates the actual count.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand. Starting with 2 5s is a safe bid since it's exactly the count I hold, ensuring validity if challenged. Bidding a higher digit (5) first could pressure opponents into riskier bids.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '2 5s' by Player 4 and considering my hand '64517209', I notice I have one 5. Since there are 24 digits in total and we are down to 3 players, each having 8 digits, the bid of '2 5s' seems plausible but not extremely high. However, to make a bid that is strictly higher, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Given my hand, I see that bidding on a higher quantity of 5s might be risky without knowing the other players' hands. Instead, looking at my hand, I have a '6' which is higher than '5'. Since '2 5s' is the current bid, I can bid on the same quantity but a higher digit, which would be '2 6s', leveraging the '6' in my hand to make an informed decision.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 4 0s builds on my holdings and increases the quantity beyond the current bid of 3 6s. With 24 total digits remaining, it's plausible there are at least four 0s across all three players' hands, especially considering my own two.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid of '4 0s' and my hand containing one 0, I must consider the likelihood of this bid being true. With 24 total digits remaining and only 3 players, the maximum number of 0s any player could have is 8. Considering the bidding history, it seems that players have been somewhat conservative with their bids. However, the bid of '4 0s' seems plausible given that I have one 0 and there could be at least three more among the other two players. Since I need to make a strictly higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Given that my hand has a 6 and a bidding history that includes '3 6s', I could consider bidding on 6s, but I would need to increase the quantity to make it a valid bid. Alternatively, challenging the bid is also an option if I think '4 0s' is unlikely, but given my own 0 and the potential for other players to have 0s, challenging might not be the safest choice without more information. Therefore, making a higher bid on a digit I have some information about seems prudent.
