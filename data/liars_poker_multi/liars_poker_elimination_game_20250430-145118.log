Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', so any valid bid is acceptable. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 1 9s is a safe and reasonable starting bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 digits in total. The current bid is 1 9s, which is very low. Since I have one 9, it's likely there are more 9s in other players' hands. I can safely increase the bid to 2 9s, which is a reasonable next step.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 2s. The current bid is 2 9s, which is likely true, so challenging is risky. By increasing the quantity to 3 and choosing the digit 2, I build on the two 2s I already have; needing just one more 2 among the other 40 unknown digits is highly probable. This is a safe and legal raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. My hand contains two 6s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected count for any digit is 4. Bidding 4 6s is a reasonable increase in quantity supported by my pair of 6s and the overall probability, requiring only two more 6s from the other 5 players. This is a strong bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 53172594, which contains no 6s. The current bid is 4 6s by Player 3. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an average of about 4.8 of each digit is expected across all hands. Since I have zero 6s, the bid of 4 6s seems plausible as the other 5 players could easily account for them. Challenging now feels risky without strong evidence that the bid is too high. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. I have two 5s in my hand, so bidding 5 5s feels reasonable, as it increases the quantity and changes the digit. However, since 5 is lower than 6, I need to bid at least 5 6s or higher to meet the 'higher bid' rule. I’ll bid 5 6s to keep the digit the same and increase the quantity, testing the waters without jumping too high.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the average count for any digit is 4.8.  A bid of 5 6s is slightly above average but not unreasonable, especially since Player 3 also bid on 6s.  However, I have two 3s and two 6s. Bidding 6 3s seems like a reasonable increase based on my hand and the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 3s. I have no 3s in my hand. Given the previous bids, especially the multiple bids on 6s, it's plausible that there are at least six 3s. However, I can increase the quantity to 7 while keeping the digit as 3, which is a reasonable bid given the limited information. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have, like 9, but starting with 1 9s and then 2 9s suggests that there aren't many 9s. Therefore, increasing the bid on 3s seems more strategic.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 3s. I have one 3 in my hand. With 5 other players, it's possible that there are at least 7 3s in total, but it's a high bid. Given the bidding history, the bids have been increasing steadily, and challenging now might be risky. I can make a safer bid by increasing the digit to a higher number, like 7 4s, which is a valid higher bid.

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:5 - o3-2025-04-16) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I see only one 4 in my own eight digits. That means the other five players would need to supply at least six more 4s to make Player 1’s bid of 7 4s true. With 40 unknown digits and each digit appearing with probability 0.1, the expected number of 4s among them is about 4, and the chance of there being 6 or more is roughly 1 in 5. Any legal raise (7 5s or 8 of anything) would be even riskier given my hand. Challenging gives me the best odds.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I hold two 2s in my hand. With 40 total hidden digits still in play, the average count for any digit is about 4. Starting with a bid of 4 2s aligns with that expectation and is supported by my own two 2s. It’s a safe yet competitive opening bid that others will have to raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s, which represents the average expected count for any digit across 40 total digits (40 / 10 = 4). Challenging a bid at the average expectation is generally risky. I need to make a higher bid. My hand contains two 4s. Bidding 5 4s is a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity from 4 to 5. With two 4s in my hand, I only need three more 4s from the remaining 32 digits (expected 3.2), making this a plausible and reasonably safe bid based on probability and my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 53172594, which contains two 5s and no 4s. The current bid is 5 4s by Player 3. With 40 total digits across 5 players, an average of 4 of each digit is expected. Since I have no 4s, the bid of 5 4s seems slightly high but still plausible if other players have a few 4s. Bidding higher, such as 6 4s, feels risky without any 4s in my hand. Instead, I can bid 5 5s, maintaining the quantity but increasing the digit, which aligns better with my hand having two 5s. This seems like a safer and more believable bid based on my own digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have one 5 in my hand. With 40 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 4 (40 / 10). A bid of 5 5s is slightly above average. I have two 3s and two 6s. Bidding 6 3s or 6 6s would be a reasonable increase based on my hand and the current bid, but the history shows higher bids for 3s and 6s in the previous round which might make players suspicious. Bidding 6 8s seems safer as I have one 8, and it's a higher quantity than the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I have no 8s in my hand. Given that there are only 40 total digits remaining across 5 players (8 digits each), it's unlikely there are six 8s. While it's possible, it's a good spot to challenge, as a successful challenge would eliminate Player 5. Bidding higher would be risky without any 8s in my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is only 1 nine, which is almost certain to be true, so challenging would be foolish. I want to raise to a number I’m likely to make. I hold two 2s in my eight-digit hand. With 24 unknown digits among the other three players, the chance that there is at least one additional 2 is very high (about 92%). Bidding 3 2s increases the quantity and uses a digit I’m strong in, giving me a solid, defensible position.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. My hand contains two 6s. With 32 total digits remaining, the expected count of any digit is 3.2. Bidding 4 6s is a valid increase over 3 2s and is well-supported by the two 6s in my hand, making it a reasonable and likely bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 53172594, which contains no 6s. The current bid is 4 6s by Player 3. With 32 total digits across 4 players, it's possible that there are 4 or more 6s in play, but since I have none, I estimate the likelihood might be low. However, challenging is risky as even one or two 6s per other player could meet or exceed the bid. Bidding higher is safer. I have two 5s, but I can't bid on 5s with a higher quantity since 5 5s was already bid in a previous round and I need to exceed 4 6s. Instead, I’ll bid 5 6s to keep the digit and increase the quantity, testing if others believe there are more 6s. This seems like a reasonable escalation without overcommitting to an unlikely high count.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 6 6s would be a reasonable increase, but it's risky given I only have one 6. Bidding 5 7s is also a possibility, but 6s have already been bid on and seem to be present. Since the total digits remaining are 32, 5 6s is plausible. I will challenge the bid, as it seems somewhat high, considering the previous eliminations and the limited number of total digits.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is None, meaning it's the start of the round. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 2 9s is a reasonable starting bid, as it's higher than the initial bid of 1 9s in the previous round and reflects what I hold.

Player 2 Reasoning: I hold zero 9s, so challenging the bid of 2 9s would give me roughly a 50-50 chance at best, and Player 0 probably has at least one 9, tilting the odds against me. I do have two 5s in my hand; to beat the current bid I must raise the quantity to at least 3. With 16 unseen digits, the probability there is at least one more 5 is about 82%, giving me a much safer position if I’m later challenged. Therefore I should raise to the minimum higher bid that leans on a digit I’m strong in: 3 5s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 5s. My hand (43276468) contains zero 5s. While challenging is an option, bidding 3 6s is a safer move. I have two 6s in my hand, meaning only one additional 6 is needed from the remaining 16 digits for a bid of 3 6s to be true. This is a high probability event, making 3 6s a strong and safe bid to make.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. Bidding 4 6s would be a reasonable increase, but I'm hesitant as I only have one 6. Bidding 3 7s would also be valid, and I have one 7. However, given the recent history of challenges succeeding, and the fact that Player 3 just bid 3 6s, it seems likely they have at least two 6s. Bidding higher on 6s feels risky. I'll challenge the bid, as 3 6s seems ambitious with only 24 total digits remaining amongst three players.

Player 3 Reasoning: It is the start of a new round with 16 total digits (8 in my hand, 8 in the opponent's). My hand contains two 6s (43276468). The average expected count for any digit across 16 digits is 1.6. Bidding '3 6s' means I believe there are at least three 6s in total. Since I have two, this requires the opponent to have at least one 6 in their 8 digits, which is a plausible scenario. This is a reasonable opening bid based on my hand strength.
