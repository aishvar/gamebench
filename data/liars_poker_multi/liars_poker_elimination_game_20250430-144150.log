Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have the digits 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 8, 3, 8 in my hand. The digit 3 appears twice and the digit 8 appears twice. Since no bids have been made yet, I want to start with a reasonable bid that reflects the presence of these digits. Bidding 2 8s is a solid start because I have two 8s, and 8 is a high digit, making it a strong opening bid.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. My hand contains an 8, and bidding 3 8s increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages the higher quantity rule while targeting a digit I possess.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 4 6s is a valid higher bid than 3 8s and leverages the two 6s I hold, making it plausible that other players have at least two more 6s to reach the required total.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 5 6s would be a reasonable increase in quantity, and it's plausible given my hand. Alternatively, bidding on a different digit might be safer, but 6s seems like a good option given my holdings. Bidding 4 7s would also be valid, but I only have one 7, making it a riskier bid. Therefore, increasing the quantity of 6s is the best option.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s made by Player 4. I have one 6 in my hand. Given the previous bids, I should bid higher on the digit 6, as it seems a reasonable quantity. I also have a 5 in my hand, but it's lower than 6, so I should focus on 6. Bidding 6 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 6s. I have one 6 in my hand, but the bid is quite high considering there are 48 digits total. To raise the bid, I must either increase the quantity above 6 or keep the quantity at 6 but increase the digit above 6. Bidding 6 7s is a valid higher bid and reasonable since I have one 7 in my hand, indicating some presence of 7s. Raising the digit while keeping the quantity the same is a safer increment than jumping to quantity 7, which might be too risky.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I have one 8 in my hand, and with 5 other players, it's unlikely there are 5 more 8s. Challenging this bid is reasonable as the actual count may be below 6.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, ensuring that the total count of 6s across all players is at least 2. Bidding '2 6s' is a safe and valid higher bid than the current '1 0s' (quantity increased from 1 to 2). This guarantees the bid's truthfulness and avoids the risk of challenging, which would result in my elimination since the current bid (1 0s) is also guaranteed to be true due to my own 0.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 3 6s is a reasonable increase, as it increases the quantity while staying with the same digit. It's a conservative bid that doesn't reveal too much about my hand, but it's higher than the current bid and within the realm of possibility.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 4. I have four 6s in my hand, which is more than the current bid quantity. I should increase the quantity to 4 and keep the digit the same, as it's a safe and reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. There are 40 digits total across 5 players, so 4 6s is a moderate bid. I can raise the bid by either increasing the quantity to 5 or keeping the quantity at 4 but increasing the digit. Given that 5 0s would be a higher quantity but a lower digit, and the digits must be strictly higher in quantity or digit, I can bid 4 7s since 7 is higher than 6 with the same quantity. I have two 7s in my hand, which supports this bid and makes it plausible.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s. Bidding 5 6s is a valid higher bid (increased quantity) and leverages my existing 6s, which aligns with the history of previous bids on 6s in this round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (google/gemma-3-27b-it:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 6 6s would be a logical next step, increasing the quantity. However, given the history of challenges and the limited number of digits remaining (40), a bid of 6 6s might be too risky. Bidding 5 7s is also an option, increasing the digit but keeping the quantity the same. Considering I have a 7 in my hand, and the previous bid involved 6s, I believe 5 7s is a reasonable and potentially safe bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s made by Player 4. I have 2 6s in my hand. Since the digit 6 is higher than 7, and I have two 6s, I'll bid 2 8s, increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 7s. I have two 7s in my hand, which supports the bid somewhat, but the bid is quite high relative to the total digits (40). To raise the bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 6 and increase the digit. Bidding 6 8s seems reasonable because I have one 8, and it is the next higher digit at the same quantity. Increasing the quantity to 7 would be riskier without stronger support from my hand. Challenging now could be risky given the previous successful challenge on 6 8s and the presence of multiple 7s in my hand. Therefore, I will bid 6 8s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 0 in my hand, so challenging '1 0s' would fail since the actual count is at least 1. My best move is to raise the bid with a digit I have multiple of. I hold two 6s, making '2 6s' a safe and defensible bid that leverages my hand strength.
