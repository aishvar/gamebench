Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand, which suggests that bidding a quantity of 3 or more 5s is reasonable as a starting bid. Since no bids have been made yet, I will start with a moderate bid that reflects the presence of 5s in my hand and is not overly aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have one 5 in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. Since I know I have one 5, and Player 0 bid 3 5s, they likely have at least one 5 as well. With 4 other players, it's quite reasonable that there are at least 2 more 5s among them. I could challenge, but it's too risky this early in the game. Instead, I'll make a conservative higher bid of 3 6s, which I feel confident about since I have a 9 in my hand, meaning there's room to go higher if needed.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. I could bid 3 7s, which is a valid higher bid. Alternatively, I could bid 4 0s. I will bid 4 0s, as it is a safe increase in quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 0s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. My hand is 95136212, which contains one 0. So, the total count of 0s across all 6 players is at least 1 (mine) plus some unknown number from the other players. Bidding 4 1s is a valid higher bid because it is the same quantity but a higher digit. However, considering the distribution, bidding 5 0s could be too aggressive without knowing others' hands. Thus, a safer bid would be to increase the digit, not the quantity.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. I hold two 2s in my hand. Bidding 4 2s minimally increases the bid by digit only and is plausible given the expected number of 2s among the 48 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I hold two 9s. With 40 unknown digits among the other five players, the expected number of additional 9s is about 4, making it very likely (≈92%) that at least two more 9s exist, giving a total of 4 or more. By bidding 4 9s I legally top the current 4 2s (same quantity, higher digit) while still making a plausible claim that will be hard to challenge—any next player must jump to a quantity of 5. This balances safety if I’m challenged with strategic pressure on the table.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand, so I cannot count on my own cards to support this bid. To make a valid higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or keep the quantity at 4 and raise the digit above 9, which is impossible since 9 is the highest digit. Therefore, I must increase the quantity to 5 and can choose any digit from 0 to 9. I have two 5s in my hand, which makes bidding 5 5s reasonable as it is a higher bid and somewhat supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I can see my hand contains one 5. Player 0 has bid 5 5s, suggesting they might have multiple 5s. However, given that I only have one 5 and the bid history shows increasing confidence, 5 5s seems reasonable. I can either bid 5 6s or higher quantity. Since I have two 9s in my hand, and 4 9s was already bid previously, I could safely bid 5 9s, which is higher than 5 5s and supported by my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Bidding higher would require me to bid 6 of any digit. Given the game history, it's not unreasonable that there are at least six of some digit out there. I will bid 6 0s. This is a higher bid than 5 9s.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 0s. My hand is 95136212, which contains one 0 and one 1, among other digits. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since I don't have information about other players' hands, I'll analyze the current bid. The total count of 0s is likely more than 6 because Player 2 bid 4 0s previously and there are 5 other players. However, I should be cautious not to overbid. I can see that my hand has no additional 0s beyond the one. Bidding 7 0s seems too aggressive without knowing others' hands. I can bid on a higher digit with the same quantity, so bidding 6 1s is a reasonable move because it's a higher digit and I have one 1 in my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: I hold two 9s. To beat the current bid of 3 2s I can keep the quantity at 3 but raise the digit. With 32 unknown digits remaining, the chance that at least one of them is a 9 is about 96%, so a bid of 3 9s is very safe while only minimally increasing the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have one '5' and one '6' in my hand, but no '9's. The bid is relatively low, so increasing the quantity to 4 and choosing a digit with a reasonable chance is a good move. The next valid bid after 3 9s must be at least 4 0s. I have one '0' in my hand, so bidding 4 0s is reasonable and maintains pressure on the other players.

Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand, I have zero 0s. The current bid of 4 0s means there need to be at least 4 zeros across all 5 players (40 total digits). While this is mathematically possible, given that I have none and it's a relatively low bid for this stage, I should make a higher bid. I have two 9s in my hand, which gives me confidence to bid 4 9s, keeping the same quantity but using a higher digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have two 8s in my hand. I don't have any 9s. I could bid 5 0s, 5 1s, etc. Bidding 5 0s seems like a safe move, increasing the quantity and keeping the digit low. There are 40 total digits, so it is not unreasonable to bid 5 of any digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have 0 zeros in my hand. The bid of 5 zeros requires all 5 zeros to come from the other 32 unknown digits. The probability of at least 5 zeros in 32 draws at p=0.1 is only about 21%, making this bid unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. With 4 players and 8 digits each, there are 24 unknown digits. At p=0.1 per digit I expect about 2.4 more 2s, for roughly 4.4 total. An opening bid of 4 2s is plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Challenging 4 2s is risky: I have only one 2, so the bid is true about 44% of the time – too big a  chance of elimination. Instead I’ll outbid. I hold two 5s, so I already contribute half of the four needed. With 24 unseen digits, the expected number of additional 5s is about 2.4, giving roughly a 70% chance that at least two more 5s exist. Therefore a bid of 4 5s is both legal (same quantity, higher digit) and reasonably safe.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s, made by Player 5. I have two 5s in my hand. To make a valid higher bid, I need to increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. I can bid 4 6s, which is the same quantity but a higher digit, and I have one 6 in my hand, making this a reasonable bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (54759439), I have zero 6s. The current bid claims there are at least 4 sixes among all 32 digits. Player 0 has been making relatively conservative bids throughout the game. However, given that I see no 6s in my hand of 8 digits, for there to be 4 sixes, the other three players would need to have them all. While possible, this seems unlikely enough to warrant a challenge, especially since challenging incorrectly only eliminates me, while letting a false bid stand could let Player 0 win.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand (54759439). With only 16 total digits in play between both players, and Player 5 claiming there are at least 3 nines total, this means they must have at least 1 nine in their hand. This is quite possible. I could bid higher, but with only 16 total digits, going much higher becomes risky. Since I know exactly how many 9s I have (2) and the bid is only claiming one more than that, I should bid '3 9s' -> '4 0s' to test Player 5's resolve while staying in a safer number range.

Player 5 Reasoning: Across both hands there are at most 16 digits. I see only one 0 in my own 8 digits. For Player 1’s bid of 4 0s to be correct, they must be holding at least three 0s themselves. In a random 8-digit hand the chance of having three or more 0s is under 4%; the chance of four or more is about 0.5%. Given these odds, the bid is almost certainly an overreach, so challenging is the best move.
