Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand out of 8 digits. With 48 digits in play and only a bid of 2 0s, it's likely there are more 0s among all players. I can safely increase the bid by either raising the quantity or the digit. Since I know there are at least 2 0s (my own), I will bid 3 0s to keep the bid conservative and force others to reveal more information.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s and no zeros, so the current bid of 3 0s by Player 1 is plausible and not worth challenging. Instead, I’ll raise to 3 9s (same quantity, higher digit) since I hold two 9s and expect at least one more among the remaining 40 digits, making three 9s likely.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s, which is likely true given that there are 40 remaining digits (expected ~4.8 9s total). Challenging would risk elimination if the bid is valid. Bidding 4 9s increases the quantity while maintaining the digit, leveraging my existing 9s and the expected distribution of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have 8 digits: 85692045, which contains one 9. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since there are 5 players other than me and each has 8 digits, the total count of 9s could be reasonably higher than 4, considering my own 9. However, bidding too high might be challenging to justify. I can bid 5 9s, increasing the quantity, which seems plausible given that there are 5 other players who could potentially have 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. My hand contains no 9s, and with 48 total digits across all players, the average number of 9s per player is 0.8. The probability of at least 5 9s existing is low, especially since the previous bids for 9s increased incrementally. Challenging this bid is a reasonable risk given the statistical likelihood of the actual count being below 5.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None' as it's the start of the round and I am Player 4, who starts the bidding. I have the digits 85692045, so I have one 0. A reasonable starting bid considering my hand and the total number of digits (40 across 5 players) would be to bid on a digit that is relatively common or one that I have. Since I have one 0 and the total count of 0s could be around 5 (assuming an average distribution), bidding 4 0s seems like a safe and reasonable starting point.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 16043410, which contains three 0s. The current bid is 5 0s, so there need to be at least 2 more 0s among the remaining 32 digits (held by 4 other players). The expected number of 0s in 32 random digits is about 3.2, so the bid is plausible. Since I have a strong holding in 0s, I can safely increase the bid to 6 0s, which is the minimal legal raise.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have no 0s in my hand, so the other 32 unknown digits must contain all 6 zeros. Expectation for zeros among 32 digits is only about 3.2, making 6 zeros very unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. With 32 total digits and uniform distribution, the expected count of any digit is about 3.2. Bidding 3 9s leverages my two 9s and stays within a reasonable range for the unknown 24 digits.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s. Bidding 4 9s increases the quantity while maintaining the digit. Given the high probability that other players hold at least one additional 9 (expected ~2.4 9s in remaining 24 digits), the total count is likely ≥4. Challenging the 3 9s bid carries ~8% risk of success (if others have 0 9s), but bidding 4 9s is a safer, defensible escalation.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:3 - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. My hand is 85692045, which contains one 9. The total count of 9s must be at least 1 (mine) plus any 9s held by other players. Given that there are 32 digits in total and I have one 9, it's plausible that the total count of 9s is around 4 or slightly higher. However, increasing the quantity to 5 9s might be too high because it implies a very high distribution of 9s among the remaining players. On the other hand, bidding on a higher digit (which doesn't exist beyond 9) isn't an option. I will analyze the likelihood of the count being higher than 4. Since I have one 9, there are 3 other players with 8 digits each, making a total of 24 digits outside my hand. It's possible that there are 3 more 9s among them, making the total count 4, which matches the current bid. Bidding 5 9s seems risky but is a valid higher bid. I'll consider challenging or making a slightly higher bid based on the digit or quantity. Given my hand and the current bid, I think bidding 5 9s is a bit too aggressive. However, I can bid on the same quantity with a higher digit, but since 9 is the highest digit, my only option is to increase the quantity. I'll choose to bid 5 9s as it's the minimum required to make a higher bid.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. Since the quantity is already at 5, I need to bid higher. I can bid 6 of any digit. I will bid 6 0s, as I have two 0s in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 0s in my hand. To meet a bid of 6 0s across 32 digits, the other 24 must contain all six, which is highly unlikely given the expected distribution. I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand out of 24 total digits. Any given digit appears on average 2.4 times; with my two 9s I only need one more among the other 16 cards. The probability of at least one additional 9 in 16 cards is about 81%, making 3 9s a reasonably safe opening bid. Bidding 3 9s also forces any response to jump to at least 4 of a digit, putting pressure on my opponents.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. The current bid is 3 9s. Considering there are two other players, each with 8 digits, it's plausible there's at least one more 9. Challenging carries a 43% risk of losing (if Player 2 has no 9s). Bidding 4 9s increases the pressure while leveraging my existing 9s to maintain control.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 3. I have the digits 85692045, which means I have one 9. With 24 total digits remaining and one 9 in my hand, the total count of 9s could be reasonably higher than 4, but it's still a relatively high bid considering the distribution. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have information about the other players' hands, I'll consider the probability and the current bid. Bidding 5 9s is a possibility but it seems risky as it implies a high total count of 9s. Alternatively, bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity (4) is an option, so bidding 4 0s is not higher, but bidding on a higher digit isn't possible since 9 is the highest digit. Thus, my best action is to either bid 5 9s or challenge. Given that I have one 9 and there are 16 digits outside my hand, it's plausible that there are at least 4 more 9s. However, bidding 5 9s is a significant commitment. I'll analyze the risk: if I bid 5 9s and it's challenged, I need at least 5 nines in total. With one 9 in my hand, there are 16 other digits, so it's a bit of a stretch but possible. I'll decide to bid 5 9s as it seems like a reasonable risk given the game history and my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The game has just started with two active players, and there is no current bid. I need to make the first bid. My hand is 85692045, which contains one 0. With 16 total digits remaining and my hand having one 0, a reasonable starting bid could be 3 0s, considering that there are 8 digits per player and it's likely there's at least one more 0 between the two hands.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s by Player 4. My hand has no 0s, and the expected number of 0s in 16 digits is ~3.2, making the bid plausible. Challenging carries moderate risk. Instead, I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 4 9s increases the quantity (from 3 to 4) and leverages my own digits for a safer, higher bid. This forces Player 4 to either call my bluff or raise further, while my hand provides partial support for the 9s count.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 3. My hand is 85692045, which contains one 9. So, the total count of 9s across both our hands is at least 2 (one in my hand and potentially one or more in Player 3's hand). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have information about Player 3's hand, I'll consider the minimum count based on my hand. Bidding 4 0s is a reasonable next step as it changes the digit and keeps the quantity the same, making it a valid higher bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s made by Player 3. My hand is 85692045, which contains one 9. So, in total, there are 2 nines that I am aware of. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since there are 16 digits in total and we have seen 2 nines so far, bidding 5 9s seems plausible as it is a relatively conservative increase in quantity. However, considering the distribution, it's also possible that the actual count is higher. I will increase the quantity to make a new bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s by Player 4. I have two 9s in my hand, so Player 4 would need at least three 9s for the bid to be true. Given the low probability of Player 4 having three or more 9s in their 8-digit hand (approximately 3.7% chance), challenging is statistically favorable. The previous successful 5 9s bid in a prior round does not guarantee repetition, and the odds heavily favor the challenger in this scenario.
