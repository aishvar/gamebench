Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since I'm the first to bid, I need to make a strategic opening bid. Looking at my hand (07449179), I have two 9s, two 4s, and one each of 0, 1, 7. A good opening strategy is to bid based on what I have in my hand, but not too aggressively. With two 9s in my hand, there are likely more 9s among the other 40 digits held by other players. A conservative estimate would be around 8-10 total 9s in the game. I'll start with a bid of 5 9s, which is reasonable given my two 9s and the probability distribution across all players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I hold two 9s in my hand and expect about four more among the other 40 digits, so bidding 6 9s has roughly a 58% chance of being correct and forces the next player to raise the quantity rather than the digit.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s. I have no 9s in my hand. There are 48 digits remaining in total. I believe it is unlikely that there are 6 or more 9s among all players' hands. Therefore, I should challenge the current bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand and with 40 digits total the expected number of 9s is 4. Bidding 5 9s gives me a >60% chance of being correct and, as the highest digit, forces opponents to raise the quantity to outbid.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have 2 9s in my hand. I should increase the quantity, but since I don't have any 9s higher than 9, I'll stick with the same digit but increase the quantity to 6.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 83990662, which contains three 9s. The current bid is 6 9s by Player 3. Given that there are 40 total digits across 5 players, it's plausible that there could be 6 or more 9s in total, especially since I already have three. In the previous round, a bid of 6 9s was challenged and the actual count was 7, which suggests 9s might be relatively common in the remaining hands. Challenging now seems risky since the bid is not excessively high compared to the total digits. Instead, I will make a higher bid to continue the game. I will bid 7 9s, increasing the quantity while staying on the same digit, as I have a strong holding of 9s myself.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. Given that the previous challenge on 6 9s revealed an actual count of 7, it's likely the true count is at least 7. Bidding 8 9s increases the quantity, maintaining the same digit but meeting the 'higher' requirement. Challenging would risk elimination if the count is indeed 7 or higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current bid of 8 9s. In my hand, I have one 9. That means there are 7 more 9s claimed to exist among the other 32 digits (4 players Ã— 8 digits each = 32, plus my 8 digits = 40 total). This would mean approximately 22% of the remaining digits would need to be 9s, which is significantly higher than the expected 10% for a random distribution. The bidding has been aggressive on 9s this round, with each player raising by exactly 1. This suggests players might be bluffing or have limited information. Given that I only have 1 nine in my hand, and the bid is already quite high at 8, I think it's unlikely there are 8 or more 9s total. I'll challenge this bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I'm starting this round with the first bid. Looking at my hand (07449179), I have one 9, one 7, one 1, two 4s, one 0, and no other digits. Since I have two 4s in my hand, that's a good starting point. With 4 players having 8 digits each (32 total digits), and assuming a roughly even distribution, each digit would appear about 3.2 times on average. Since I already have two 4s, it's reasonable to estimate there might be 5-6 total 4s among all players. Starting with a conservative bid like 3 4s would be safe, but I want to make a slightly more aggressive opening bid to set the tone.

Player 1 Reasoning: I see only one 4 in my hand. Among the other 24 unknown digits the chance of at least three more 4s (to meet the bid of 4) is about 43%, so the bid is more likely a bluff. Challenging has a >56% chance to win, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I'm starting the bidding in this new round with 3 players (myself, Player 3, and Player 4). Looking at my hand (07449179), I have two 4s, two 9s, one 7, one 1, one 0, and one 5. Since I have two 4s in my hand, there are likely to be more 4s among the other players. Similarly, I have two 9s which might be a good digit to bid on based on previous rounds where 9s were common. I'll start with a moderate bid of 4 9s, which is reasonable given I already have 2 of them in my hand, so I only need 2 more among the 16 digits held by other players.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have one 9 in my hand. Given that the current bid is relatively low, I'll bid a higher quantity of the same digit, 9, to increase my chances of winning.

--- Turn: Player 4(Orig:1 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 83990662, which contains three 9s. The current bid is 5 9s by Player 3. With a total of 24 digits across three players, it's possible that there are at least 5 9s in play, especially since I already have 3. The history shows that bids on 9s have been high in previous rounds, with counts reaching up to 7 when there were more players. However, with only 24 digits now, a bid of 5 is still plausible but on the higher side. I could bid higher, like 6 9s, but that feels risky since it would mean assuming 3 more 9s in the remaining 16 digits. Alternatively, I could switch to a different digit, but my hand doesn't have strong counts for other digits (two 6s and two 0s). Given the history and my contribution of 3 9s, I think 5 9s is believable and not worth challenging. I'll make a higher bid of 6 9s to push the game forward, though I'm aware this is a bit of a gamble.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the likelihood of there being 6 9s across all players. In my hand, I have one 9. For Player 4's bid of 6 9s to be true, there would need to be 5 more 9s between Player 3 and Player 4 (who each have 8 digits). This is possible but not highly probable. Looking at the history, in the previous round with 32 total digits, there were 7 9s total. Now with 24 digits, it's reasonable that there could be 6 9s. However, both Player 3 and Player 4 have been willing to bid on 9s, suggesting they might have some 9s in their hands. I could bid 7 9s, but that's risky given I only have one 9. I could also switch to a different digit, like 7 0s (I have one 0), but that's also risky without knowing the distribution. Given that I only have one 9 in my hand and would need 5 more between two players, I think challenging is the safer move here.

Player 0 Reasoning: I'm starting the final round against Player 3. I need to analyze my hand (07449179) to make a strategic opening bid. Looking at my digits, I have: one 0, one 1, two 4s, one 7, one 9. I don't have any 2s, 3s, 5s, 6s, or 8s. Since I'm making the first bid, I want to choose a digit that I have multiple copies of (like 4) or a digit that has performed well in previous rounds. In previous rounds, 9s were common (with actual counts of 7 and 4). I have one 9 in my hand, so bidding on 9s could be reasonable. I'll start with a moderate bid of 3 9s, suggesting there are at least 2 more 9s in Player 3's hand. This is a reasonable opening that isn't too aggressive.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge Player 3's bid of 4 9s. Looking at my hand (07449179), I have one 9. Since there are 16 total digits in play (8 from me and 8 from Player 3), and I know I have one 9, there would need to be at least 3 more 9s in Player 3's hand for their bid to be valid. The probability of Player 3 having 3 or more 9s in their 8 digits is relatively low. Additionally, in the previous round, when Player 4 bid 6 9s, the actual count was only 4, suggesting that 9s aren't extremely common. Based on this, I think challenging is the better option than making a higher bid like 5 9s or 4 0s.
