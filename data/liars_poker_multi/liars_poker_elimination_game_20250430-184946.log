Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 'None', meaning I can make any initial bid. I have 8 digits in my hand: 7, 5, 6, 2, 4, 5, 8, 5. I see that I have three 5s. Starting with a bid of '3 5s' seems reasonable as it's based on my own hand and allows me to set the initial bar.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 3 5s and my hand 14054259, which does not contain any 5s, I must decide whether to bid or challenge. Since my hand does not provide any direct insight into the likelihood of the current bid being true or false, I must consider the overall game state. With 48 total digits remaining and 6 players, the average distribution would suggest that each digit could appear around 4-5 times if evenly distributed. However, this is a strategic game, and actual distributions can vary greatly. The bid of 3 5s is relatively low and could be plausible. Considering I have no 5s and cannot directly assess the validity of the bid, making a higher bid without additional information could be risky. Given these considerations, challenging the bid might seem like an option, but without a strong reason to believe the bid is false, it's also risky. Since the current bid is low and my hand does not offer significant insight into the distribution of 5s, I should consider making a bid that is slightly higher and reasonable based on potential distributions. However, any bid I make must be strictly higher than 3 5s, meaning I could either increase the quantity or the digit. Given my hand contains a 9, which is a high digit and might be less common, bidding on it could be strategic, but I need to balance between making a bid that is too high to be credible and one that is reasonable based on the game's state.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. Challenging 3 6s is unwise since with 40 unknown cards we expect about four more sixes. A minimal raise to 3 9s is very safe: I only need one more 9 among the other 40 cards (~98.5% chance).

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand out of 8 digits. Since there are 6 players, the average expectation per digit is about 4.8 (48 digits / 10 digits). The current bid is 3 9s, which is reasonable and likely to be true. Since I have two 9s myself, it's very likely that there are at least three 9s among all hands. Challenging now would be risky. The next valid bid must be either 3 0s, 3 1s, ..., 3 9s (but that's already the bid), or 4 0s. Of these, 4 9s is a reasonable bid because I have two already and it's plausible that there are at least two more among the other 40 digits. I will bid 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. With 48 total digits spread across 6 players, the average number for any digit is 4.8. The bid of 4 9s is plausible, making a challenge risky (I would need the other 5 players to have fewer than 2 9s among their 40 digits, which is unlikely). I must make a higher bid. The next possible bids start at quantity 5. I have two 9s and two 5s. Bidding 5 9s means the other 5 players (40 digits) need to have at least 3 more 9s. The expected number of 9s among 40 random digits is 4, so needing 3 is quite probable. Bidding 5 5s is similarly probable as I have two 5s. Bidding 5 9s continues the escalation on 9s and is well-supported by my hand and probability.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have zero 9s in my hand. The current bid is 5 9s, which seems high given that there are only 48 digits total and 5 players besides me. The probability that there are at least 5 9s across all hands is low, especially since I have none. Challenging seems like the best move.

Player 4 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round, and the current bid is None. My hand contains two 5s and two 9s. With 40 total digits across 5 players, the average count for any digit is 4. Since I have two 5s, I need 3 more 5s from the remaining 32 digits held by other players. The average expectation from the other players is 3.2 (32/10). Bidding 5 5s is a reasonable starting bid based on having two of that digit and being slightly below the average expectation from others.

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:5 - meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s made by Player 4. I have 8 secret digits: 7, 5, 6, 2, 4, 5, 8, 5. I count that I have three 5s in my hand. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 40 and there are 5 active players, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Given that the bid is 5 5s, I need to assess if it's likely or not. With my three 5s, and assuming the other players have a reasonable distribution, it's possible that there are at least 5 fives in total. However, to make a valid higher bid, I can increase either the quantity or the digit. Bidding 6 5s seems a bit aggressive without more information, but bidding 5 6s seems reasonable as it's higher in digit and I have a 6 in my hand.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:2 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 6s and my hand containing one 6, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least 5 sixes among all players. Since each player has 8 digits and there are 5 players, the maximum number of any digit can be 5 if all players have that digit once, which is highly unlikely. My hand does not provide strong evidence for or against the current bid, but considering the total number of digits remaining is 40, bidding higher in quantity seems risky without strong confidence. However, since my hand does contain a 6, and given that bidding must be strictly higher, I could consider increasing the digit or the quantity. Given the constraints and the goal to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I must weigh the risk of challenging versus making a potentially unsustainable bid. Since I only have one 6 and there are 40 digits in total, challenging the bid of 5 6s seems reasonable because it questions the likelihood of at least 5 sixes existing without having to commit to an even higher quantity or digit that might be unsustainable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given that the current bid is 'None', I need to make the first bid. Looking at my hand, 14054259, I see that I have one 1, one 4, one 5, two 2s, one 9, and one 6. Since the goal is to make a valid higher bid, I should consider the digits I have and their potential distribution among other players. With 32 total digits remaining and 4 players, each player has 8 digits. I have two 2s, which suggests that bidding on 2s could be a safe start, considering the relatively low quantity and the fact that I'm starting the bidding. A bid of 4 2s seems reasonable, as it accounts for my two 2s and potentially two more from other players, which is plausible given the total number of digits and the number of players.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. By raising to 4 9s I only need two more 9s among the other 24 unknown digits, which has about a 70% chance. This is the smallest legal increase (same quantity, higher digit) that leverages my strong holding and is defendable if challenged.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand (digits: 76029891). The current bid is 4 9s, which means at least four 9s among all 32 digits. Statistically, with four players and 8 digits each, there are likely to be about 3-4 of any specific digit, but I already have half of the required 9s. It is plausible that at least two more 9s exist among the remaining 24 digits (held by three other players). Since the bid is not outrageous and I have strong holdings in 9s, challenging is risky. The next valid bid would be 4 9s -> 5 0s, 5 1s, ..., 5 9s or 4 9s -> 4 0s-4 8s (not possible, as the digit must increase if the quantity stays the same). The lowest next bid is 5 0s. I will make the minimal higher bid to keep my options open.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s. Player 2 previously bid 4 9s, suggesting there are likely other 9s among the remaining players. Bidding 5 9s is a valid increase over the current bid of 5 0s (same quantity, higher digit) and is well-supported by the information available. Challenging 5 0s is risky as I have no 0s myself, and 5 is not an impossible count for 32 digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: Given the current bid of 5 9s and the fact that I have one 9 in my hand (14054259), I must consider the likelihood of there being at least 5 nines among all players. Since each player has 8 digits and there are 4 active players, the total number of digits is 32. The highest possible count for any digit is 32, but given the bids and challenges so far, it seems unlikely that 9s would be so prevalent. However, since a challenge was made on a bid of 5 9s previously and the bidder won with an actual count of 8, it indicates a significant presence of 9s. Considering my own hand and the previous outcomes, making a higher bid seems risky without more information about the other players' hands. Challenging the current bid of 5 9s appears to be a safer option, as it forces a reveal of the actual count of 9s, which could potentially eliminate Player 4 if the count is less than 5, or it could confirm the presence of a high number of 9s, making the challenge a learning experience for future bids.
