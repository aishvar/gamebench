Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand. Since there are no bids yet, I can start with a conservative bid based on my hand. Starting with a bid of 2 6s is reasonable as it reflects my own hand and leaves room for others to increase the bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 6s, which is very low considering there are 48 total digits (6 players * 8 digits). Statistically, we expect about 4.8 of each digit (48/10). Challenging such a low bid is highly likely to fail. I need to make a higher bid. My hand is 90589844, containing two 8s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid (quantity increases from 2 to 3), is supported by the two 8s in my hand, and is statistically very plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 1. I have one 8 in my hand. Given that there are 6 active players and each player has 8 secret digits, there are a total of 48 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48. I should consider the likelihood of there being at least 3 8s in total. Since I only have one 8, and without knowing the distribution of other players' digits, I need to assess if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. Bidding 4 8s or higher seems risky without more information, but I can also consider bidding a different digit. I have two 7s, and bidding on 7s could be a safer strategy. Bidding 2 7s is not higher than 3 8s, but bidding 3 7s or 3 9s could be strategic. However, I can make a more informed decision by considering the challenge option.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 10895661, which contains two 6s, one 0, one 8, one 9, and three 1s. The current bid is 3 9s by Player 2. I have one 9 in my hand, so it's possible that there are at least three 9s across all players, given that there are 48 total digits. Challenging now might be risky since the bid isn't extremely high. Instead, I can make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 3 9s, I can bid either 4 of any digit or stay at 3 but with a higher digit. However, digits only go up to 9, so I must increase the quantity. I’ll bid 4 0s, as it's a reasonable increase and a new digit, making it harder for others to gauge the likelihood based on previous bids focused on 6s, 8s, and 9s.

Player 3 Reasoning: Since there are no bids yet in this round and I am starting the bidding, I need to make a conservative initial bid. My hand is 10895661, which gives me two 6s, two 1s, and one each of 0, 8, 9, and 5. With 5 players and 40 total digits, a safe starting bid would be based on a digit I have some of in my hand. I’ll bid 3 6s, as I have two 6s myself, and it’s plausible that at least one more 6 exists among the other 32 digits.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand is 21813385. I have two 8s, two 1s, two 3s, one 2, and one 5. The current bid is 3 6s. I have no 6s. A bid of 3 6s is a reasonable starting bid for 5 players with 40 digits.  I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s is a possible move as it's a higher digit with the same quantity. Bidding 4 of any digit is also possible. Given my two 8s, bidding 3 8s is a safe and logical step.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which means there needs to be at least two more 8s among the other four players' hands. Given that the previous bid was 3 6s and was increased to 3 8s, it's possible that Player 5 has an 8. However, with only one 8 in my hand, the likelihood of there being two more among the remaining players is uncertain. I think it's safer to challenge the bid rather than risk making a higher bid that might not be sustainable.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first to bid in this round. I have two 1s, two 8s, and two 3s in my hand. A bid of 3 8s was successful in the previous round when there were 40 digits. With 32 digits, bidding 3 8s again is a reasonable starting bid, as I have two 8s myself.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 8s in my hand (90589844). This means only one more 8 is needed among the remaining 24 digits (held by Player 2, Player 3, and Player 5) for the bid to be true. The probability of at least one 8 existing in those 24 digits is very high (approximately 1 - (0.9)^24 ≈ 92%). Therefore, challenging '3 8s' is extremely risky and likely to result in my elimination. I should make a higher bid. The next possible bid is '3 9s'. I have two 9s in my hand. Similar to the previous bid, '3 9s' only requires one more 9 among the other 24 digits, making it a very safe and statistically likely bid. It's a minimal increase that puts pressure on the next player.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 1. I have the digits 5, 2, 3, 0, 2, 8, 7, and 8 in my hand. I see that there are 32 total digits remaining across 4 players, which means each player has 8 digits. I have one 8 and one 9 in my hand. Given that the bid is 3 9s, and I only have one 9, it's possible but I need to assess if I can make a valid higher bid or if challenging is more strategic. Since my goal is to make a higher bid or challenge, I note that bidding higher than 3 9s requires either a higher quantity or a higher digit. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. I can bid 4 or more of any digit, or bid 3 of a higher digit than 9, but since 9 is the highest digit, I must bid a higher quantity. I have 1 nine in my hand, and if others have 2 more, it could be possible. However, challenging seems risky without more information. A bid of 4 8s seems reasonable as it is higher in quantity than 3 9s and I have two 8s in my hand.

Player 3 Reasoning: My hand is 10895661, which contains one 8. The current bid is 4 8s by Player 2. With 32 total digits across 4 players, it's possible but not highly likely that there are 4 or more 8s in total, especially since I only have one. However, previous rounds show that bids on 8s have been successful, with an actual count of 8 in a prior challenge when there were more digits in play. Given that, the likelihood of at least 4 8s seems plausible with 32 digits remaining. I don't want to risk a challenge yet. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Since 4 8s is the current bid, I can bid 4 9s to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. I have one 9 in my hand, so it's a reasonable bid to make.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains two 8s and zero 9s. The current bid is 4 9s.  With 32 total digits, the expected number of any digit is around 3.2. A bid of 4 9s is slightly above average.  Considering I have no 9s, and the bid is already 4, challenging seems like a reasonable option as the actual count of 9s is likely to be less than 4. Bidding higher on 9s is not supported by my hand, and bidding on a lower digit with a quantity of 4 or higher is also risky with my hand composition.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round. I have two 1s, two 2s, two 3s, two 5s, and two 8s in my hand. A safe starting bid is based on the digits I have multiples of. Bidding 3 8s is a reasonable starting point given I have two 8s and there are 24 total digits, meaning there's a decent chance of at least one more 8 among the other two players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 8s in my hand (90589844). This means only one more 8 is needed across the other two players (16 digits) for the bid to be true. This is statistically quite likely (expected number of 8s in 16 digits is 1.6), so challenging seems risky. A higher bid is required. I can bid the same quantity (3) with a higher digit, or increase the quantity to 4. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s requires only one more 9 among the other 16 digits, which has a similar likelihood to the current bid of 3 8s. This is a safe, incremental bid based on my hand.

Player 5 Reasoning: My hand contains two 8s. The current bid is 4 8s. With 24 total digits remaining, 4 8s is not an unreasonable bid, representing about 1 in 6 digits being an 8. However, I have two 8s, meaning the other two players need to have at least two more 8s combined for the bid to be true. Given the previous bids and challenges, it's difficult to be certain about the other players' hands. Bidding higher than 4 8s would require a significant increase in quantity or moving to 9s, which I don't have many of. Challenging 4 8s is risky as it's a plausible bid. Bidding 5 8s is a possibility, but I only have two 8s myself. Bidding 4 9s is also an option to increase the digit, but I have no 9s. Considering the current bid and my hand, bidding 5 8s is a reasonable step, increasing the quantity based on my strong hand in 8s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand (90589844). The current bid is 5 8s by Player 5. Previously in this round, Player 2 bid 4 8s, and Player 5 bid 3 8s before raising to 5 8s. This indicates both opponents likely hold some 8s. For the current bid of 5 8s to be true, there need to be at least 3 more 8s between Player 2 and Player 5 (16 cards total). Given their bidding, this seems plausible (e.g., P2 has 1-2, P5 has 2-3). Challenging 5 8s feels risky as it could easily be true. The next possible bid for me is 5 9s or 6 0s upwards. I have two 9s, but P5 challenged 4 9s last round, suggesting they might be low on 9s, making 5 9s risky. Bidding 6 of a low digit is unsupported by my hand. The most logical step is to continue with 8s, leveraging the bids from P2 and P5. Bidding 6 8s requires 4 more 8s from the other 16 cards. Given P2 bid 4 8s and P5 bid 5 8s, it's conceivable they collectively hold 4 eights. This bid puts pressure on Player 2.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s made by Player 1. I have 2 8s in my hand. Given that there are 3 active players and each has 8 digits, the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24. However, with 6 8s already bid, it's unlikely but possible. I have one 9 in my hand, and I see that the previous bids included 3 9s. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 7 8s seems too risky given my 2 8s, but bidding 7 9s seems reasonable as it accounts for my 9 and possibly others.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 9s. I have two 8s and no 9s in my hand. With only 24 total digits, a bid of 7 9s seems very high. The expected number of 9s is around 24 / 10 = 2.4. A bid of 7 is significantly above this. While players might be bluffing or have many 9s, the probability suggests this is a risky bid for Player 2. Challenging seems the most likely winning move.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 8s in my hand (90589844). This means for the bid to be true, Player 5 only needs to have one 8 out of their 8 digits. This is highly likely (probability is high that they have at least one 8). Therefore, challenging is too risky. I need to make a higher bid. Possible higher bids are 3 9s or increasing the quantity (e.g., 4 0s, 4 4s, 4 8s, 4 9s). I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s is a minimal increase and requires Player 5 to have only one 9, which is also plausible.

A bid of 3 9s is not unreasonable, as it would mean Player 1 has at least three 9s.  However, I have two 8s, and the last bid I made was 3 8s. Given the history, Player 1 might be trying to push me towards a high bid.  I can bid 4 8s, which is higher than 3 9s and is supported by my two 8s, suggesting Player 1 has at least two 8s as well. Alternatively, I could challenge 3 9s, but without knowing Player 1's hand, it's a risk.  Bidding 4 8s seems like a safer and strategically sound move given my hand and the current bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s made by Player 5. I have two 8s in my hand (90589844). For the bid to be true, Player 5 needs to have at least two 8s (4 total - 2 in my hand = 2 needed from Player 5). Player 5 has consistently bid on 8s throughout the game, including bidding 3 8s and 5 8s in previous rounds, and 3 8s and 4 8s in this round. This suggests they likely hold at least two 8s, making a challenge risky. The next possible bid is 4 9s. I have two 9s in my hand. Bidding 4 9s is a minimal increase, is supported by my hand, and follows my previous bid of 3 9s. This puts the pressure back on Player 5 without taking a significant risk.

For Player 1 to have 4 9s, they would need to have all four of their 8 digits be 9s, which is unlikely but possible. However, bidding 5 8s based on my two 8s seems like a safer and more likely bid to be true than Player 1 having 4 9s. I have successfully challenged high bids in the past, but with only two players and 16 digits, the probability of high bids increases. Bidding 5 8s is a valid higher bid and aligns with my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 90589844, containing two 8s. The current bid from Player 5 is 5 8s. For this bid to be true, there must be at least 5 eights in total across both hands (16 digits). Since I have two 8s, Player 5 must have at least three 8s in their hand of 8 digits. Player 5 has escalated bids on 8s this round (3 8s, 4 8s, 5 8s), suggesting confidence or a bluff based on holding some 8s. Bidding higher seems risky: Bidding 6 8s requires Player 5 to have four 8s (less likely, and they'd probably challenge if they had 0-3 eights, causing me to lose). Bidding 5 9s (I have two 9s) requires Player 5 to have three 9s; Player 5 has successfully challenged bids on 9s twice before, making it very likely they would challenge 5 9s if they hold fewer than 3, leading to my loss. Challenging 5 8s forces a resolution based on whether Player 5 actually has the required three 8s. While their bidding suggests they might, 5 out of 16 is a substantial claim, and there's a reasonable chance they are bluffing or only hold two 8s (in which case the total is 4, and I win the challenge). Given the risks of bidding higher, challenging seems the most calculated move.
