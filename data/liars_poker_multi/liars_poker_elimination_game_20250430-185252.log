Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I want to make a safe opening bid based on my hand. I have the following digits: 6, 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 8, 1. Each digit appears once. Since there are 6 players, it's likely that every digit appears multiple times across all hands. I'll start with a conservative bid of 2 6s, as I have one 6 myself and it's plausible that at least one more exists among the remaining 40 digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand contains two 9s. The current bid is 2 6s. Bidding 2 9s is a valid higher bid since the digit (9) is higher than 6, maintaining the same quantity but increasing the digit value.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. Given my hand, I have two 9s, which suggests that the digit 9 is present. However, I don't have any 9s that are higher than the current bid. My best option is to increase the quantity of the digit 9, so I'll bid 3 9s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, and among the 40 unknown digits there are on average 4 more 6s, making a total of at least 4 6s quite likely. Bidding 4 6s both increases the quantity and uses a digit I hold.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 6s. I have one 6 in my hand, so I cannot support a bid of 4 6s or higher with my own count. The previous bids of 2 9s and 3 9s suggest that higher counts of 9s are plausible, but my hand doesn't support that. Bidding 4 6s would be risky since I only have one 6. The next logical move is to challenge, as the previous bid of 4 6s seems unlikely given the distribution and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The previous round ended with no bids, and now it's my turn to start. I have 2, 0, 7, 2, 4, 5, 1, 0 in my hand. Counting the digits: 0 appears twice, 2 twice, 4 once, 5 once, 7 once, and 1 once. The most common digits are 0 and 2, each appearing twice. To make a safe opening bid, I should choose a low quantity and a digit I have multiple of, like 2 0s or 2 2s. Bidding 2 0s seems reasonable because I have two zeros, and it's unlikely the total count is less than 2. Alternatively, I could bid 2 2s for the same reason. Since 0s are generally less common than 2s in total, starting with 2 0s is a cautious choice. Bidding 2 0s is a safe, conservative opening that can be challenged if the opponent believes otherwise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 0s made by Player 4. I have 3 zeros in my hand. Given that there are 5 active players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 40 digits. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 40. Since I have to make a bid strictly higher than 2 0s, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding 3 0s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity and is supported by my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 60247981, which contains one 0. The current bid is 3 0s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in play. Statistically, each digit should appear about 4 times, but the actual distribution can vary. Since I have only one 0, there need to be at least two more 0s among the other 32 digits (held by 4 other players). That's plausible, but not guaranteed. However, a bid of 3 0s is not unreasonable at this stage, and challenging now would be risky. I will raise the bid to 3 1s, as I have one 1 in my hand and 1s are as likely as 0s. This keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, which is a valid next bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 1s in my hand, and the current bid is 3 1s. Bidding 3 2s is a valid higher bid since it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This leverages my hand's 2 and avoids challenging a bid that may be plausible given the total digits remaining.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: Considering the current bid of 3 2s made by Player 1, I have a 3 in my hand which is part of the current bid. I can safely increase the digit to 3, maintaining the same quantity. This is a reasonable bid based on my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 3s, and I need to make a higher bid. Looking at my hand (2, 0, 7, 2, 4, 5, 1, 0), I have one 1 and two 0s. The total remaining digits are 40, so I could safely bid 4 0s, which is higher than 3 0s, or I could increase the digit to 4 with 3 counts. Since I have two 0s, bidding 4 0s is risky but still plausible, but increasing the digit from 3 to 4 with 3 counts is safer because I have no 4s. Alternatively, I could challenge the current bid if I think it's unlikely. Given my hand, I have no 3s or 4s, so the only plausible higher bid is 4 0s, but I only have 2 zeros, so that would be a lie. The next logical move is to challenge, as the count of 3s is unlikely to be accurate, especially since previous bids have been challenged and eliminated players. Therefore, challenging the current bid seems the best move.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 3s made by Player 2. I have two 3s in my hand, which means there are at least 2 3s in total. Considering the total number of digits remaining is 32 and there are 4 active players with 8 digits each, bidding a higher quantity or digit seems reasonable. I will bid 3 3s to increase the quantity, as I have a reasonable chance of having a higher total count of 3s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand is 60247981, which contains no 3s. The current bid is 3 3s, meaning there must be at least three 3s among the 24 digits held by the other three players. Since it's quite possible for three or more 3s to exist in 24 digits, challenging is risky. Instead, I will make a higher bid. I have two 0s and two 9s in my hand, so I can build on either of those. Bidding 3 9s seems reasonable since I already have two myself, and there are likely at least one more among the remaining 24 digits.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 9s. I have two 9s in my hand, and the total digits remaining are 32. Bidding 4 9s increases the quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my existing 9s and pushes the bid higher, making it a strategic move.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s made by Player 2. I have two 9s in my hand. Given that there are 3 other active players and each has 8 secret digits, the total number of digits is 32. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32. Bidding a higher quantity or a higher digit seems reasonable. I can see that bidding 6 0s would be higher than 5 9s in terms of quantity but I don't have enough information about other players' hands. However, I can try to make a bid that seems plausible given my hand and the current bid. I will bid 6 9s, increasing the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have only one 9 in my hand ('60247981'). The current bid is 6 9s, which means across all 32 digits, there must be at least 6 nines. Since I have only 1, that would require at least 5 more among the other 24 digits (8 digits per player, 3 other players). The probability of 5 or more 9s in 24 random digits is quite low (expected value is 2.4). Given the aggressive escalation of 9s in bidding, and based on my hand, it's very unlikely that there are 6 or more 9s. I should challenge.

Given that there are only 24 digits in total and 8 digits per player, with 3 players remaining, the maximum possible count for any digit across all players is 24. The current bid of 5 9s seems plausible but I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. I have two 9s in my hand. If I bid 6 9s, it must be higher than 5 9s. However, considering the distribution and the fact that other players might also have 9s, I need to evaluate the likelihood of 5 9s being true or false.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s, and the previous challenge confirmed the actual count was 6. Since the total digits are 24, the maximum possible 9s is 24, but the current bid is already 6. To bid higher, I must increase the quantity (e.g., 7 9s) as the digit cannot be higher than 9. My hand has two 9s, but the actual count is 6, making a challenge risky. Bidding 7 9s is the only valid higher bid.

Given that there are only 16 digits in total and we are down to 2 players, I should consider the likelihood of there being more than 3 9s.
