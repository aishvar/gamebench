Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since I'm the first bidder, I need to make an initial bid based on my hand. Looking at my hand (44610771), I have: two 7s, two 4s, one 6, one 1, and one 0. The most frequent digits in my hand are 4s and 7s with two each. I should bid based on one of these digits since I have direct knowledge of them. I'll bid on 7s since they're a higher digit. A conservative starting bid would be '4 7s' - I know I have two 7s, and it's reasonable to expect at least two more among the other 40 digits held by other players.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. With 6 players and 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits. Player 0 bid 4 7s, which is quite reasonable given I already see two of them. Since challenging would be risky, I should bid higher. I can bid 4 8s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit, which is a safe play since I have one 8 in my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand and there are 40 unknown digits, so I expect about 4 unknown 9s. There’s roughly a 78% chance of at least 3 more to reach a total of 4. Bidding 4 9s is the smallest valid increase and delays pushing the quantity higher.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 4.8. The bid of 4 9s is plausible, even though I have no 9s in my hand. Challenging is risky as the actual count could easily be 4 or more. I must make a higher bid, which means bidding a quantity of 5 or more. My hand (23824006) contains two 0s and two 2s. Bidding 5 of either 0s or 2s requires only 3 more of that digit from the remaining 40 digits held by other players, which is a reasonable expectation. Bidding 5 0s is a valid and strategically sound next bid based on my hand composition.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s, which means at least five zeros are claimed among all players. I have no zeros in my hand. The previous bids were 4 7s, 4 8s, and 4 9s, which are plausible counts. Given that zeros are not very common and I hold none, the bid of 5 zeros is somewhat risky but not impossible. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can either bid 5 1s or higher. I have two 2s in my hand, so bidding 5 2s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same. This bid is plausible given my hand and the previous bids.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have two 2s in my hand, but the total count across all players could be higher. Bidding 5 3s increases the digit while keeping the same quantity, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages the possibility that other players might have more 3s, making the bid plausible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid than '5 3s' or challenge it. Looking at my hand (44610771), I have two 7s, two 1s, one 0, one 4, one 6, and zero 3s. Since I don't have any 3s in my hand, there can be at most 40 3s among the other players (5 players × 8 digits = 40 potential digits). For the bid of '5 3s' to be valid, we need at least 5 3s total. With 6 players and 8 digits each, the probability of having at least 5 3s is reasonable. I could bid '5 4s' (increasing the digit), '5 5s', '5 6s', etc., or increase the quantity to '6' of some digit. Since I have one 6 in my hand, I'll bid '5 6s', which is higher than the current bid and has some support from my hand.

Player 1 Reasoning: In my hand of 39897339, I have zero 6s. The current bid is 5 6s, meaning there would need to be 5 sixes among the other 40 digits (5 players × 8 digits). While possible, this seems unlikely given the aggressive bidding pattern and that no one has challenged yet. The bid history shows increasing confidence, but 5 6s without having any in my own hand makes me skeptical. I'll challenge rather than raise to 5 7s or 6 0s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I'm starting the new round with my hand containing 44610771. I have two 7s, two 4s, one 6, one 1, and one 0. Since I'm the first to bid in this round, I need to make a strategic opening bid. I want to bid on a digit I have multiple of to increase my confidence. With two 7s in my hand, there are likely more 7s among the other players. A conservative opening bid would be 4 7s, which worked well for me in the previous round. This is a reasonable starting point that's not too aggressive but establishes a decent threshold for others to overcome.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. I have zero 7s in my hand, which means I lack personal information about the total count of 7s. Challenging this bid would be risky, especially since Player 2 made the bid and might have some 7s. Bidding is a safer option. I need to bid strictly higher than 5 7s. My hand contains one 8. Bidding 5 8s is a valid bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is plausible based on my hand; it requires 4 more 8s from the remaining 32 digits, which is close to the expected number (3.2). This is a minimal increase and a reasonable bid based on my hand.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 8s. I have three 8s in my hand, which supports the plausibility of the bid. To raise the bid, I must increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. I can bid 5 9s, which is a higher digit at the same quantity. Since I have two 9s, this is a reasonable and valid bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. My hand contains no 9s, and with 40 total digits remaining, it's unlikely that there are 5 9s across all players. Challenging this bid is a reasonable risk given the low probability of the bid being true.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. My hand is 44610771, which contains no 0s. The current bid is 2 0s made by Player 5. With 4 players having 8 digits each (32 total digits), and none of those digits in my hand being 0s, there could still be up to 24 zeros in the other players' hands. The bid of only 2 0s is quite conservative and likely to be true. I could challenge, but it's risky since I have no information suggesting there are fewer than 2 zeros total. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have three 7s, two 4s, one 6, one 1, and zero of other digits. I could bid 3 0s, but that's risky since I have no 0s. A safer option would be to keep the quantity at 2 but increase the digit, such as '2 1s' (I have one 1), '2 4s' (I have two 4s), or '2 7s' (I have three 7s). Since I have three 7s, bidding '2 7s' is very safe.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 7s by Player 0. I hold two 7s so challenging would certainly lose. I can raise to the highest same‐quantity bid: 2 9s. I have one 9, and with 24 unknown digits the expected number of 9s is 2.4, so the probability of at least one other 9 is about 92%. Bidding 2 9s also blocks any further 2-level bids and forces opponents to raise to 3, putting them under more pressure.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 9s. I have zero 9s in my hand. While challenging is an option when you have zero of the bid digit, 2 9s is a relatively low bid given that there are 32 total digits in play (expected count of any digit is 3.2). Challenging a low bid is risky. I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 3 0s is a valid higher bid (increasing the quantity from 2 to 3) and is well supported by my hand, requiring only one additional 0 from the other 24 digits. This is a safer and more strategic move than challenging or bidding on a digit I have fewer of.

Player 0 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. Looking at my hand (44610771), I have zero 1s. The current bid is '3 1s' made by Player 5. With 4 players having 8 digits each, there are 32 total digits in play. Player 5 is claiming there are at least 3 ones among all players. Since I have zero 1s, those 3+ ones would need to come from the other 3 players (Players 2, 3, and 5). This is certainly possible. I could challenge, but it's a risky move since the bid is relatively low. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s, which gives me confidence to bid on 7s. I also have one 4s, two 4s, one 6, and one 0. I'll bid '3 4s' which is higher than '3 1s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity. This is a safe bid given I have two 4s myself, so I only need one more 4 among the other 24 digits held by other players, which seems likely.

Player 0 Reasoning: I need to make the first bid of this round. Looking at my hand (44610771), I have: two 7s, two 4s, one 6, one 1, and one 0. Since I have two 7s, that's a good digit to bid on. There are 24 total digits in play (8 digits × 3 players), so I can reasonably expect a few more 7s among the other players. A conservative starting bid would be 3 7s, which means I'm only expecting one more 7 among the other 16 digits the opponents have.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 7s, made by Player 0. My hand contains two 2s and two 0s, but no 7s. Bidding 4 2s is a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and is supported by having two 2s in my hand. This makes it a reasonable expectation that at least two more 2s exist among the other 16 digits held by the other two players. Challenging 3 7s is risky as 3 is not an extremely high bid for 24 digits, and it's plausible the other players hold three or more 7s combined, especially since I have none.

With 16 total digits across two players, bidding 3 of a digit I have two of is a reasonable and conservative starting bid. I will bid 3 0s, as I have two 0s and only need Player 0 to have at least one more 0 out of their 8 digits for the bid to be true. This sets a low baseline for the round.

Player 0 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (44610771), I have zero 0s. Player 3 has bid 3 0s, meaning they believe there are at least 3 zeros between our combined 16 digits. Since I have none, all 3 would have to be in their hand. While this is possible, it would mean over a third of their hand is zeros, which is somewhat unlikely. However, I could either challenge or make a higher bid. If I challenge and they do have 3 zeros, I lose. Making a higher bid is safer. I have two 1s, two 4s, and three 7s in my hand. I could confidently bid 3 1s, 3 4s, or 4 7s. Since I have three 7s myself, bidding 4 7s is reasonable as Player 3 would only need to have one 7 for this to be true.
