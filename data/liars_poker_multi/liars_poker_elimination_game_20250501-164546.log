Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given that this is the start of the bidding and there are no previous bids to consider, I should make a bid that is reasonable and based on the information I have from my hand. My hand contains 44263118, which has a variety of digits. A safe and strategic start could be to bid on a digit that I have at least one of, considering the total number of digits in play is 48. Since I have one 1 and one 8, and given the distribution of digits could be random, bidding on a lower to medium quantity of a digit that appears in my hand seems prudent. Let's choose a digit that appears in my hand and make a bid that is not too aggressive but still opens the bidding.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. Since the current bid is 3 1s, bidding 3 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid is truthful based on my hand and leverages the existing count of 7s, which is likely a strong position.

Player 1 bids: 3 7s

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:2 - qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have an 8 in my hand, and the current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 3 8s increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a valid higher bid. This leverages my own digits without assuming others' hands.

Player 2 bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:1 - mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) [6 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 8s in my hand, which suggests that there could be more 8s among the other players' hands. However, bidding higher on 8s might be risky. Instead, I could bid on a digit I know I have more of, like 3s. I have one 3, so bidding 4 3s is a reasonable increase in quantity and a lower digit. Alternatively, I could challenge the current bid of 3 8s, as it seems plausible but not guaranteed that there are exactly three 8s among all players. Challenging could eliminate Player 2 if they are bluffing. However, bidding 4 3s is a safer play to avoid the risk of elimination if Player 2 is telling the truth.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: Player 3 bid 4 3s. I have 0 3s in my hand. The current bid seems unlikely, so I should challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The previous round ended with a bid of 4 3s, which was challenged and won. The current round has no bids yet. Bidding 3 8s seems reasonable based on my hand and the lack of bids so far.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I hold one 8 in my hand. With 40 total digits across 5 players, the expected number of 8s in the remaining 32 digits is ~3.2. Bidding 4 8s is plausible since my 8 plus ~3 in others' hands would meet the bid. Challenging risks elimination if the bid is correct. Increasing the quantity to 4 8s raises the stakes while staying within statistical likelihood.

Player 5 bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 0(Orig:4 - meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 8s and considering my hand contains one 8, I must assess the likelihood of there being at least four 8s among all players. With 40 total digits remaining and each player having 8 digits, the maximum number of any single digit is capped. Since my hand only contributes one 8 and I have no information about the other players' hands except through their bids, I must consider the bid history and the total possible digit count. The previous bid of 3 8s by Player 3 and the current bid of 4 8s by Player 5 indicate a focus on the digit 8. However, without more 8s in my hand and given the relatively high bid, challenging seems like a viable option, especially since the total number of digits is 40 and we are already at a bid of 4 8s, which might be on the higher side considering the distribution of digits could be varied.

Player 5(Orig:5 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) starts the next bidding round.

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: As the first to bid, I need to set a plausible starting point. My hand contains an 8, and previous rounds showed 8s were present (e.g., 5 total in a 32-digit pool). Bidding 3 8s leverages my existing 8 while allowing room for others to have additional 8s. This is a conservative opening bid that balances safety and strategic digit focus.

Player 5 bids: 3 8s

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:0 - qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s. Bidding 4 7s requires at least one more 7 in the remaining 24 digits across three opponents, which is highly probable given my strong holding. This bid increases quantity over the previous bid and leverages my personal information.

Player 1 bids: 4 7s

--- Turn: Player 2(Orig:2 - qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 7s. I have one 8 in my hand, and bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid since the digit is higher than 7. This maintains the same quantity but increases the digit, which is allowed. I don't have enough information to confidently challenge, so making a strategic bid is preferable.

Player 2 bids: 4 8s

--- Turn: Player 3(Orig:1 - mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor) [4 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: There are 32 digits remaining across 4 players, with 8 digits per player. The current bid is 4 8s. I have one 8 in my hand. Given the history of bids and the fact that there are fewer digits remaining, it seems unlikely that there are 4 8s in total. Challenging the bid appears to be a strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid of 3 2s. This increases the quantity beyond my actual count, which is a common strategy to pressure others into challenging or bidding higher.
Attempting to parse extracted action string: 'BID: 3 2S'
Player 2 bids: 3 2s

--- Turn: Player 5(Orig:5 - qwen/qwen3-32b:floor) [3 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 2s. My hand contains one 2. With two other players having 16 digits, the expected number of 2s in their hands is 1.6. Total expected 2s is 2.6, slightly below the bid of 3. Challenging gives a ~50% chance of winning if the actual count is less than 3, which is plausible given the low expected value. Bidding higher (e.g., 4 2s or 3 3s) would require more 2s/3s than likely exist in the remaining digits. Challenging is the optimal move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. Since the current bid is None, I can start with a bid of 2 2s, which is certain to be valid as I have two of them. This sets a low but safe bid that the opponent would be unlikely to challenge without risking a loss.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. Bidding 3 7s is a safe bid since the total count across both hands must be at least three. This bid is strictly higher than the current bid of 2 2s and leverages my known high-frequency digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand contains two 7s and an 8. The current bid is 3 7s. Bidding 3 8s is a valid higher bid since the digit (8) is higher than 7, maintaining the same quantity. This leverages my existing digits without overcommitting to a higher quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand, making 4 7s a logical bid since Player 2 could hold at least one more. Challenging 3 8s is risky because Player 2 might have three 8s, but bidding 4 7s leverages my strong 7s and forces Player 2 to respond.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. Bidding 4 8s is a valid higher bid, as it matches the quantity but uses a higher digit. This leverages my existing digits without overreaching.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have three 7s in my hand. Bidding 5 7s is reasonable because Player 2 needs to have at least two 7s to meet the total of five. This bid increases the quantity from the current bid of 4 8s and leverages my strong holding in 7s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 7s. My hand contains two 7s. Since there are only 16 total digits remaining, the actual count of 7s is likely to be low. If Player 1's hand has fewer than 3 additional 7s, the total would be less than 5, making a challenge a viable option. I have no strong reason to believe the bid is accurate, so challenging is the logical choice.
