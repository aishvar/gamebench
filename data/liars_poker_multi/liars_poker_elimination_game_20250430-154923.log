Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no bids have been made yet, I can start with a conservative bid. I have two 7s in my hand. Bidding 4 7s seems like a good starting point, as it's likely there are at least four 7s among all players.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 70595039, which contains one 7. The current bid is 4 7s by Player 0. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an average of about 4.8 of each digit is expected across all hands. Since I only have one 7, it’s possible but not highly likely that there are at least three more 7s among the other 40 digits. However, bidding higher is safer at this stage. I’ll bid 5 7s to increase the quantity slightly, testing the waters without making an overly aggressive bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (o4-mini-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand. With 40 unknown digits, the probability of at least four more 7s is only about 60%, so I won’t challenge. Instead, I can minimally increase the bid by keeping the quantity at 5 and raising the digit to 9. I hold two 9s, making 5 9s much more plausible (over 75% chance).

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits. The expected number of any digit is 4.8. A bid of 5 9s is very close to the expected average and therefore plausible, making a challenge risky. I have one 9 in my hand (52922739), which slightly supports the bid. To bid higher, I must bid at least 6 0s. My hand contains three 2s, which is a strong suit. Bidding 6 2s leverages this strength. For this bid to be true, there need to be at least 3 more 2s among the other 40 digits (5 players * 8 digits). This is statistically plausible (3/40 = 7.5%, compared to the overall expected 10%). Bidding 6 2s is a safer and more informed move than challenging or bidding on a digit where I hold fewer cards.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains three 6s. The current bid is 6 2s. Bidding 7 6s is a valid higher bid as it increases the quantity. This bid requires 4 more 6s from the remaining 40 digits held by other players. The expected number of 6s in 40 random digits is 40 * (1/10) = 4. Therefore, bidding 7 6s is well-supported by my hand and is a statistically plausible bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 7 6s and I have one 6 in my hand, increasing the quantity to 8 seems reasonable because it's still within the realm of possibility given the total number of digits remaining (48) and the fact that I have one 6. This bid is higher than the current bid in terms of quantity, making it a valid move.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Given that there are 48 digits remaining, it's plausible that there could be 8 or more 6s among all players. However, bidding higher on 6s is risky. I have two 7s in my hand, and previous bids on 7s were lower. Bidding 6 7s is a reasonable increase in quantity while maintaining the same digit.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 8 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. Since the last bid was 7 6s, it's likely that there are at least 7 6s among all players. Bidding higher on 6s is risky. Challenging seems like a better option, as it's unlikely that there are 8 6s given the distribution of digits so far.

Player 0 Reasoning: Since it's the start of the round and there is no current bid, I need to make the first bid. I have two 7s and two 9s in my hand. Bidding 3 9s seems like a reasonable starting point, as it's likely that other players have at least one 9, and it's a higher digit than previous bids in the last round.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 70595039, which contains two 9s. The current bid is 3 9s by Player 0. Since I have two 9s myself, it’s plausible that there is at least one more 9 among the other 32 digits across the remaining players, given a total of 40 digits. However, I need to make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity to 4 9s or bid on a different digit. Given that I have two 9s, bidding 4 9s seems reasonable as it’s not a huge stretch from the current bid and aligns with my hand. Alternatively, I could bid on another digit I have, like 5s (I have two), but increasing to 4 9s feels safer and more strategic at this stage.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 9s in my hand. There are 32 unseen digits, and with a 10% chance per digit, the expected number of additional 9s is 3.2. The probability of at least 3 more 9s (for a total of 5) is around 63%, making a bid of 5 9s plausible. Since the current bid is 4 9s, I must increase the quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 9s. I have two 9s in my hand (52922739). This means for the bid to be true, there must be at least 3 more 9s among the other 4 players (32 digits). The expected average number of any digit is 4 (40 total digits / 10 digits). A bid of 5 is slightly above average. Players 0, 1, and 2 have already bid on 9s (3 9s, 4 9s, 5 9s), suggesting they might hold some. Challenging 5 9s seems risky. I have three 2s, which is my strongest digit. Bidding 6 2s is a valid higher bid (increasing quantity from 5 to 6). Since I hold three 2s, this requires only 3 more 2s among the remaining 32 digits, which is plausible and leverages my hand strength.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (openrouter/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-thinking), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 2s. My hand contains three 6s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected count of any digit is around 4. Adding my three 6s, the expected total count of 6s is around 7. Bidding 7 6s is a valid higher bid than 6 2s and is strongly supported by the composition of my hand, making it a plausible and strategic move. Challenging 6 2s is an option, but the bid isn't extremely unlikely (expected count of 2s is 4.2), so bidding based on my strong hand is preferable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have two 6s in my hand. The last challenge was successful, indicating that some players might be bluffing. The bid of 7 6s seems plausible, but since I have two 6s and there are 40 digits remaining, it's risky to bid higher on 6s. Instead, I should challenge the bid, as it's likely that the actual count of 6s is less than 7.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 2s in my hand. The previous round had a bid of 6 2s, which was not challenged, suggesting there might be several 2s in other players' hands. Bidding 7 2s seems reasonable, increasing the quantity based on the previous bid and my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 70595039, which contains no 2s. The current bid by Player 0 is 7 2s out of a total of 32 digits across all 4 players. Since I have 0 2s in my 8 digits, the other 3 players must collectively have at least 7 2s in their 24 digits for the bid to be valid. This means roughly 29% of their digits need to be 2s, which is higher than the expected average of 10% per digit. While it's possible, it feels unlikely. However, challenging is risky as I have no information on others' hands, and 7 2s is not an extreme bid. Instead, I can make a safer bid. My strongest digits are 0, 5, and 9, each appearing twice in my hand. Bidding on 9s seems promising given the history of bids on 9s in previous rounds (up to 5 9s). I will bid 7 9s, increasing the digit while maintaining the quantity, as I have 2 9s myself, and it's plausible that others have a few more based on past bids.

Player 1 Reasoning: Since it's the start of a new round with no current bid, I need to make an opening bid. My hand is 70595039, giving me two 9s, two 5s, two 0s, one 7, and one 3. With 24 total digits across three players, a conservative bid is wise to avoid an early challenge. Bidding on 9s seems reasonable since I have two of them, and statistically, there could be more among the other 16 digits. I'll bid 4 9s, which is a moderate increase but still plausible given the total digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have two 9s in my hand (52922739). This means Player 0 and Player 1 need to have at least two 9s combined across their 16 digits for the bid to be true. This is plausible (2/16 = 1/8, close to the expected 1/10). Challenging feels risky. My strongest digit is 2, as I hold three 2s. The next possible bid is 5 0s. Bidding 5 2s requires Player 0 and Player 1 to have at least two 2s combined (5 total - 3 in my hand = 2 needed). This is the same requirement (2 needed from others) as the current 4 9s bid, but I have more information supporting the 5 2s bid (I hold three 2s vs two 9s). Additionally, Player 0 bid 7 2s in the previous round, suggesting they might hold 2s, making them less likely to challenge a 5 2s bid. Bidding based on my strongest suit seems like the safest and most strategically sound move.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 70595039, which contains no 2s. The current bid is 6 2s by Player 0. With only 24 total digits across three players, a bid of 6 2s means that on average, each player would need to have 2 2s in their hand. Since I have none, the other two players would need to have a total of 6 2s between them, which is possible but somewhat unlikely given that it requires an average of 3 2s per player in their 8-digit hands. However, looking at the bidding history, Player 3 previously bid 5 2s, and Player 0 raised it to 6 2s, which suggests they might have some 2s to support the bid. I also have strong digits in my hand, such as three 9s and two 5s. Bidding higher on 9s (e.g., 6 9s) could be a safer move since I contribute significantly to that count. Given the risk of challenging and the possibility that 6 2s might exist, I will avoid a challenge and instead make a higher bid of 6 9s, leveraging my own hand strength.

Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s made by Player 1. I hold two 9s (52922739). For the bid to be true, the other 16 digits held by Player 0 and Player 1 must contain at least four 9s. This is plausible, making a challenge risky. I hold three 2s. Player 0 previously bid 6 2s just before Player 1 bid 6 9s. This suggests Player 0 likely holds several 2s as well (perhaps 3). Combining my three 2s with Player 0's likely 2s, a total of 6 2s seems very probable. Bidding 7 2s only requires one additional 2 from the remaining 16 digits (Player 1's hand and potentially more from Player 0). This seems like a safer and more informed bid than challenging 6 9s or bidding on another digit.

Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 70595039, which contains two 9s, two 0s, one 7, one 5, and one 3. The current bid by Player 0 is 3 2s. I have no 2s in my hand, so I must rely on the likelihood of 2s being in Player 0's hand or make a higher bid based on my own strong digits. With only 16 total digits remaining (8 mine, 8 theirs), a bid of 3 2s means Player 0 likely has at least one or two 2s. However, I can make a safer bid by increasing the quantity or digit. I have two 9s, so bidding 4 9s feels reasonable as it’s a higher bid (higher digit than 2s) and I contribute two to the count. This minimizes risk compared to challenging, as the bid of 3 2s isn’t outrageously high with 16 digits in play.

Since I have none, all 5 would need to be in their hand or split improbably. However, increasing the bid to 5 9s is a safer move for me since I have two 9s, and it's possible that Player 0 has some 9s as well, given the history of bids on 9s.
