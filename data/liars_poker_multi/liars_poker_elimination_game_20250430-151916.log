Player 0 Reasoning: I have two 6s in my hand, which suggests there are likely multiple 6s across all players. Since there are 48 digits in total, starting with a conservative bid of 2 6s is reasonable to open the bidding and sets a baseline for others to increase.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 7s in my hand. Since the current bid is 2 6s, bidding 2 7s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and ensures a truthful claim based on my own digits, making it a safe and strategic move.

Player 2 Reasoning: My hand has two 7s. The current bid is 2 7s. Since I have two 7s, I know the bid is at least met by my hand alone. With 5 other players, it's highly likely there are more 7s. Bidding 3 7s is a safe and logical increase.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 7 in my hand, so only two more sevens are needed among the other 40 cards; with an expected ~3.8 sevens remaining, the current bid is plausible and not worth challenging. I also have one 8 and expect about 3.8 additional 8s, so bidding 3 8s (same quantity, higher digit) is a safe raise.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 30125482, which contains one 8. The current bid is 3 8s by Player 3. With 6 players and 48 total digits, it's plausible that there are at least two more 8s among the other players, as each player has 8 digits. Bidding higher is safer than challenging at this point. I can bid 4 8s, increasing the quantity, as I have one 8 and it's reasonable to assume there could be more. Alternatively, I could bid 3 9s to switch to a higher digit, but sticking with 8s feels more confident based on the bidding trend.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. My hand contains two 9s, and bidding 4 9s is a valid higher bid since it matches the quantity (4) but uses a higher digit (9 > 8). This leverages my existing digits without assuming others' hands, making it a strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s, which means at least four 9s exist among all players. I have no 9s in my hand, so I cannot rely on my own cards to support this bid. However, given there are 48 digits total, four 9s is plausible but somewhat risky. I must bid higher than 4 9s. The next higher bid could be 5 0s or 4 0s, but 4 0s is not higher than 4 9s, so the only valid higher bid is 5 0s. I have one 0 in my hand, which gives some support to bidding 5 0s. Bidding 5 0s is a reasonable move to increase the bid and keep the game going.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid of 5 0s has a slightly higher than 50% chance of being true based on expected distribution. Challenging is risky. Bidding 5 3s leverages my own holdings and continues the bid progression logically.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 59837171. I have one 3. The current bid is 5 3s. With 6 players and 48 total digits, an average digit count would be around 4.8 (48 / 10). A bid of 5 3s is slightly above average but not wildly improbable, especially considering the previous bids have been escalating. I have one 3, so I know at least one exists. I could challenge, but it feels risky at this point. I can make a valid higher bid. I have two 7s in my hand, which could support a bid on 7s. Bidding 5 7s is a higher digit than 5 3s. Bidding 6 0s is also an option, increasing the quantity. Given the escalation and my hand, bidding 5 7s seems like a reasonable step up.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 7 and one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 5 7s, which requires four more 7s among the other 40 cards (≈60% chance). A minimal valid raise is to 5 8s; I hold one 8, so it also needs four among the remaining 40 (≈60% chance). This is a reasonable risk with the smallest possible increase.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 30125482, which contains one 8. The current bid is 5 8s by Player 3. With 48 total digits across all players, a bid of 5 8s is plausible but on the lower side of likelihood given that I only have one 8. However, since the bid is not extremely high, and previous bids have escalated to 5 for other digits, I think it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I will bid 6 8s, increasing the quantity, as I believe there could be more 8s in other players' hands based on the bidding pattern.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 8s. I have two 9s in my hand, and bidding 6 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This leverages my existing cards while adhering to the rules. Challenging risks losing if the bid is accurate, so bidding is safer.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 9s, which means there are at least six 9s among all players. I have no 9s in my hand, which reduces the likelihood of this bid being true. Considering there are 48 digits total and 6 players, six 9s is possible but somewhat high, especially since the previous bid was 6 8s and 8s are generally less common than lower digits. Bidding higher would require at least 6 0s, which I have two of, or increasing the quantity to 7, but that seems risky without strong evidence. Given the high bid and my hand, challenging is the best move.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. Since the current bid of 2 6s is likely true (given the average expected count for any digit is around 4), challenging would be risky. Bidding 3 3s leverages my two 3s and requires only one additional 3 across the remaining 32 digits (4 players * 8 digits) to be valid, which is statistically probable.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 59837171. I have one 3. The current bid is 3 3s. With 5 players and 40 total digits, the expected number of any digit is 40/10 = 4. A bid of 3 3s is slightly below the average expectation. However, I only have one 3. While it's possible there are two more 3s among the other four players, challenging seems risky when the bid is close to the statistical average and I have one of the digits. Bidding higher is the safer option. I have two 7s and one 8. Bidding 3 7s or 3 8s would be a valid higher bid based on my hand. Bidding 3 7s is a direct increase in digit from the current bid and aligns with having two 7s.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand, so I’d need two more among the 32 unknown digits. The probability of at least two 8s in those is about 84%, and bidding 3 8s is the minimal valid increase over 3 7s.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand is 30125482, which contains two 8s. The current bid is 3 8s by Player 3. Since I have two 8s myself, it's plausible that there is at least one more 8 among the other players' hands to make the total of 3. With 40 total digits across 5 players, the average number of any digit is 4, so a bid of 3 is conservative. I will raise the bid to 4 8s, as I believe it's a reasonable increase and still likely to be safe given my own contribution to the count. This also pressures the next player to either bid higher or challenge.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have two 6s in my hand but no 8s. Given there are 40 digits total, 4 8s is plausible but somewhat high. To raise the bid, I must increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. The next valid bids after 4 8s would be 4 9s or 5 0s. Since 4 9s is only one higher digit but same quantity, and 5 0s is a higher quantity, I consider the likelihood of 5 0s. I have two 6s but no 0s, so bidding 5 0s might be risky. Bidding 4 9s seems more reasonable as it's only slightly higher than the current bid and I have no 9s either, but it is safer than jumping to 5 0s. Challenging now might be premature as 4 8s is not an extreme claim. Therefore, I will bid 4 9s.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 9s in my hand. With 4 other players holding 32 digits total, the expected number of 9s (assuming uniform distribution) is 3.2, which is below the bid of 4.

Bidding 3 7s leverages my two 7s (same quantity, higher digit than 3s) and forces Player 3 to respond to a credible bid, shifting focus to a digit I hold.
