Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: Since no previous bid has been made, I can start by establishing a reasonable bid based on my hand. My hand contains the digits: 6, 1, 0, 2, 0, 5, 6, 0. Counting the total potential occurrences: 0 appears 3 times, 6 appears 2 times, 5 appears once, 2 once, 1 once. The most common digit is 0 with 3 counts. Starting with a bid of 3 0s seems safe and aggressive enough to challenge others to bid higher or challenge me. Bidding 3 0s is a solid opening, given the counts in my hand and the total digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 0s. I hold two 2s in my hand. With 40 unknown digits among the other five players, it is very probable that at least two additional 2s are present (expected about four). Raising to 4 2s both increases the quantity and shifts to a digit I have good coverage for, making the bid reasonable and defensible if challenged.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have 8 digits in my hand (35157775) and see no 2s. With 6 players total, each having 8 digits, there are 48 total digits. Player 1 claims there are at least 4 2s. Since I have zero 2s in my hand, that means the remaining 40 digits (outside my hand) would need to contain at least 4 2s. While this is possible, I can make a safer bid. I have three 7s in my hand, so bidding '4 7s' is a very strong play - I know there are at least 3, and it's highly likely there's at least one more 7 among the other 40 digits.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 9 in my hand. With 40 unknown digits and a 10% chance per digit, the expected number of 9s is about 4. The probability of at least 3 more 9s among the unknowns (giving a total of 4) is roughly 78%, making a bid of 4 9s a safe minimal raise.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. There are 6 players with 8 digits each, totaling 48 digits. The expected average count for any digit is 4.8. I have one 9 in my hand (36581229). For the bid of 4 9s to be true, there need to be at least 3 more 9s among the other 5 players (40 digits). The expected number of 9s in those 40 digits is 40/10 = 4. Since needing 3 is below the expectation, the bid of 4 9s is plausible, and challenging it seems risky. I must make a higher bid, which means bidding at least 5 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s. Bidding 5 2s requires only 3 more 2s among the other 40 digits. This is below the expected value of 4 for those digits, making it a statistically strong bid. Furthermore, Player 1 previously bid 4 2s, potentially indicating strength in 2s among other players. Therefore, bidding 5 2s is the most strategically sound move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have one 2 in my hand, so the total count of 2s across all players is likely around 5 or fewer, given the other players' bids on different digits. Bidding 6 2s would be risky since I only have one 2. The next higher digit after 2 is 3, and I have no 3s, so I cannot bid 4 3s. Bidding 5 3s would be a logical next step if I had any 3s, but I do not. Alternatively, I could challenge, as the total number of 2s might be less than 5, making the current bid unlikely.

Player 5 Reasoning: I am Player 5 and I start the bidding for this round. There are 5 active players and 40 total digits. The expected average count for any specific digit is 40 / 10 = 4. My hand is 36581229, and I have two 2s, which is my most frequent digit. Bidding '4 2s' aligns with the statistical average and is supported by my hand containing two 2s. This seems like a reasonable and safe opening bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I see two 2s in my own hand. With 40 total digits in play, the average count for any digit is around 4. For a bid of 5 2s, the other 32 unseen digits would need to contain at least three more 2s. The probability of that is comfortably above 60%, making the bid plausible. Challenging the current bid of 4 2s would be unwise because it is also very likely to be correct. Raising the quantity to 5 2s leverages the twos I already hold and keeps the bid credible while forcing the next player to act.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have zero 2s in my hand. The previous round revealed there were 6 2s when all 6 players were active. Now with one player eliminated, and that player potentially having had some 2s, it's very suspicious that there would still be 5 2s. Even if all other players kept their 2s, the total is likely lower now. Given I have none, and one player was eliminated, the claim of 5 2s seems unlikely.

Player 1 Reasoning: As the opening bidder I want a safe, modest bid. I hold two 2s. With 32 digits in play, the expected count of any digit is a bit over 3, so needing only one more 2 among the other 24 hidden digits gives roughly a 92% chance the bid is correct. This low-risk opener establishes a baseline and keeps plenty of room to raise later if needed.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: There is no current bid, so I must open. I hold two 2s (2,6,2,1,1,8,3,5). With 16 unrevealed digits among the other two players, the probability that at least one additional 2 exists is very high (around 80% under a uniform distribution, and past rounds suggest 2s have been plentiful). Therefore a bid of 3 2s is quite safe while still pressuring the opponents, and it continues the successful pattern that has already led to two opponent eliminations.

Player 4 Reasoning: I hold two 4s in my hand, so to meet a bid of 3 4s there only needs to be one additional 4 among the 16 unknown digits. The probability of at least one more 4 is about 82%, making this a strong raise over 3 2s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 4s made by Player 4. I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. My hand is 36581229. I have zero 4s. For the bid of 3 4s to be true, the other two players (Player 1 and Player 4) must have at least three 4s between their 16 digits. This is plausible (average 1.6 needed), making a challenge somewhat risky. Looking at my hand, I have two 2s. Player 1 previously bid 3 2s in this round, suggesting they likely hold at least one 2. Combining my two 2s with Player 1's likely 2s, a bid of 4 2s seems well-supported. This bid is higher than 3 4s (increases quantity) and leverages information from my hand and the bidding history.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (o3-2025-04-16), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I can already see two 2s in my own eight digits. Player 5 has repeatedly bid on 2s in earlier rounds and just bid 4 2s now, strongly implying they hold multiple 2s themselves. If they have even two 2s, the table already shows four, so only one more 2 is required in Player 4’s eight unseen digits to make a total of five. With 16 unknown digits in the other two hands, getting at least three more 2s overall (to reach five) is quite plausible, and much more likely than the current bidder being wrong on four 2s. Challenging therefore looks risky, while increasing the quantity by one is the safest legal raise. I’ll push the bid to five 2s.

Player 4 Reasoning: I hold only one 2, so for there to be at least five 2s total the other 16 cards must contain four or more 2s. The probability of that is under 7%, making the bid of 5 2s very unlikely. I should challenge.

Player 1 Reasoning: Because I hold exactly two 2s in my eight-digit hand, I can safely open with a bid of 2 2s. This bid cannot be beaten by a challenge (there are at least two 2s for certain), yet it is low enough to force Player 5 to decide whether to raise the quantity or switch digits on their turn.

Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 2s made by Player 1. I have two 2s in my hand (36581229), which means the current bid of 2 2s is guaranteed to be true. Therefore, challenging is not an option. I need to make a higher bid. Given that I hold two 2s, bidding 3 2s is a natural progression. Player 1 has consistently bid on 2s in previous rounds, suggesting they likely hold at least one 2. If Player 1 has one or more 2s, a bid of 3 2s will be correct. This bid leverages my strong hand in 2s and puts pressure back on Player 1 based on their likely holdings.

Player 1 Reasoning: I know for certain that there are 2 twos in my own 8-digit hand. To satisfy Player 5’s bid of 3 twos, at least one of their 8 unknown digits must also be a 2. The probability of that is 1 – 0.9^8 ≈ 57%, meaning there’s roughly a 43% chance the bid is wrong. Any legal raise I could make (e.g., 4 2s, 3 3s, 4 1s) would require the total count of that digit to be 4 or more, which has a much lower probability of being true (≈19%). Challenging therefore offers the highest chance of victory.
