Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: As the first bidder, I need to make a conservative opening bid. My hand contains two 3s and two 5s. Bidding 3 3s is reasonable since I have two, and there are 5 other players who might hold at least one more 3. This creates a plausible minimum count while allowing room for escalation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: I have no 3s in my hand, but the current bid of 3 3s by Player 0 is relatively low for a total of 48 digits across 6 players. On average, we would expect about 4-5 of each digit in total. However, since I have none, it might be slightly less likely, but challenging a bid of only 3 seems risky. Instead, I will make a higher bid. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 4 6s feels reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit, and I can support part of the count myself.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. With 48 digits in play, a bid of 4 6s is plausible but not excessive. Since I only have one 6, I can't be confident enough to challenge. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and raise the digit. Bidding 4 7s is a safe increment, and I have one 7 in my hand to support it.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: Given the current bid is 4 7s, I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since my hand contains 25980116, I have no 7s but I do have other digits. Considering the bidding history, players have been increasing the quantity or the digit. With 48 total digits remaining, bidding a higher quantity of the same digit or the same quantity of a higher digit is possible. However, without specific information about other players' hands, challenging seems risky. Given that I have two 1s and other digits, but no 7s or 8s, and considering the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 48, making a bid that increases the quantity or digit from the current bid seems reasonable. Since I don't have enough information to confidently challenge the bid of 4 7s, and given that my hand doesn't contain any 7s but does contain 1s and other lower digits, I should consider bidding on a digit I have or challenging if the bid seems too high. Given the constraint that my bid must be strictly higher, and without having a clear advantage in any specific digit to confidently bid higher, I must weigh the risk of challenging versus the potential of making a higher bid. The presence of two 1s in my hand and the fact that no bids have focused on lower digits like 1 suggests an opportunity. However, bidding on a digit like 1 might not be the best strategy given its lower value and the fact that higher bids have been successful so far. Considering all factors and aiming for a balance between risk and potential gain, I decide to challenge the current bid because making a strictly higher bid without sufficient confidence in the digits' distribution across all players could be risky, and the current bid of 4 7s, while possible, might be on the higher side given the total number of digits and the fact that no player has bid on the higher digits like 8 or 9, which could indicate their scarcity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I am the first to bid this round. My hand is 33615927, which contains two 3s, one 6, one 1, one 5, one 9, one 2, and one 7. With 5 players and 8 digits each, low bids are standard for opening. Based on my own hand, bidding 3 3s is safe since I have two 3s myself, making it likely that at least one more exists among the other 32 digits. This is also a standard opening bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I hold two 8s in my hand. With 32 other digits, it's very likely there’s at least one more 8, making a total of three 8s. This is a safe conservative raise over 3 3s.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 4 0s is a valid higher bid than 3 8s, and with 40 total digits, it's plausible there are at least four 0s across all players. This leverages my own hand while pushing the bid forward.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-32b:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have one 1 in my hand and no zeros. The current bid is 4 0s. Bidding 4 1s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, leveraging my existing 1 and the likelihood of additional 1s in other players' hands. Challenging 4 0s is risky since the expected number of zeros in remaining digits (32) is 3.2, making the bid plausible but not certain.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: My hand is 61805972, which contains one 1. The current bid is 4 1s by Player 0. With 5 active players and a total of 40 digits, an average of 4 ones across all hands is plausible since each digit should appear roughly 4 times on average. Since I only have one 1, it's possible the other players have the remaining 3 or more. However, I can make a higher bid to test the waters. I have two 6s in my hand, so bidding 4 6s feels reasonable as it's a higher digit with the same quantity, and I contribute half of the bid myself. I’ll avoid challenging for now since 4 1s is statistically possible.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 33615927, which contains one 6. The current bid is 4 6s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in total. Statistically, each digit should appear about 4 times, so 4 6s is plausible. However, since I only have one 6, the bid is risky for the bidder if others also have low counts. But since the bid is not outrageous and there is a reasonable chance that four or more 6s exist, I should make a higher bid. I have two 3s in my hand, so bidding 4 7s (since I also have a 7) or 4 9s (since I have a 9) is possible, but I only have one of each. The next highest bid is 4 7s. I will bid 4 7s, as I have one 7 in my hand, and it's a safe incremental bid.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 7s. By bidding 4 8s, I only need two more 8s among the 32 unknown digits, which is very likely given the expected count of 8s (~3.2) and high probability (~84%). It’s the minimal valid higher bid.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 5 0s is a logical next step as it builds on my holdings and exceeds the current bid of 4 8s in quantity. Given the total digits remaining (40) and the expected distribution, this bid remains plausible.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 0s. My hand contains one 1 and no 0s. Bidding 5 1s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Since I have one 1, and there are 40 total digits, it's plausible other players have enough 1s to meet the bid. Challenging 5 0s is riskier since the bidder could have 0s in their hand, making the total count potentially valid.

--- Turn: Player 1(Orig:4 - x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor) [5 players left] ---
Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (x-ai/grok-3-beta:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 1s made by Player 0. In my hand, I have two 1s, which contributes to the total count. With 5 active players and 40 total digits, an average of 4 ones across all hands would be expected if digits were uniformly distributed. Since I have 2 ones, it's plausible that the total could reach 5. However, bidding higher, such as 5 2s or 6 1s, feels risky without strong support from my hand for other digits. I could bid 5 6s since I have two 6s, which might be safer. Given the bidding history shows a pattern of incremental increases and my hand supports a bid on 6s, I’ll go with 5 6s to stay in the game and avoid an immediate challenge risk.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: My hand is 33615927, so I have one 6. The current bid is 5 6s. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits total. Statistically, each digit appears about 4 times. For the bid of 5 6s to be valid, there must be at least 4 other 6s among the 32 unknown digits, which is possible but above average. Given that 6 has not been heavily bid up in this round, some players may have some 6s, but it's not guaranteed. However, the bid is not outrageous and could easily be met. To stay in the game and avoid a risky challenge, I will make a higher bid using information from my hand. I have two 3s, so I'll bid 5 7s, since I have one 7 and it raises the digit while keeping the quantity.

Player 4 Reasoning: I hold two 8s. Opening with 3 8s is very safe— I need just one more 8 among the other 24 digits, which is highly likely (~91%). Additionally, bidding 3 8s limits opponents: they can only bid 3 9s at the same quantity or raise the quantity. Therefore I'll start with 3 8s.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s made by Player 0. In my hand, I have two 1s out of my 8 digits, which suggests that 1s might be somewhat common. With 32 total digits across 4 players, a bid of 4 1s seems plausible but on the lower side. I could challenge, but since I have two 1s myself, it's likely there are at least two more among the other 24 digits. Instead, I’ll make a higher bid. I also have two 6s in my hand, so bidding on 6s feels safe. I’ll bid 4 6s, as it increases the digit while maintaining the quantity, and I’m confident in at least two 6s from my hand contributing to the total.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 9 in my hand. Bidding 2 9s increases the digit while maintaining the same quantity, making it a valid higher bid. Since 9 is a high digit, Player 4 is less likely to have one, but the bid remains plausible if they do.

Player 4 Reasoning: I hold two 8s in my hand. To reach 3 8s, my opponent need only one more 8 among their 8 unknown digits (≈83% chance). The current bid of 2 9s requires one 9 from them (≈57% chance). Raising to 3 8s is a valid and safer increase, so I will bid 3 8s.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s by Player 4. My hand contains no 8s, and the total possible 8s in the game are limited to Player 4's 8 digits. Bidding 3 9s leverages my single 9, increasing the digit while maintaining a plausible claim. Challenging the 3 8s carries risk, as Player 4 might hold three 8s (as seen in prior rounds). Bidding 3 9s shifts focus to a digit where I have partial support and forces Player 4 to either challenge or raise further.

Player 4 Reasoning: Player 0’s bid of 3 9s follows his earlier 2 9s bid, strongly suggesting he holds at least two 9s, so challenging would almost certainly fail. I hold two 8s and have been bidding 8s this round, so raising to 4 8s is the most consistent way to continue and gives me my best chance.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. I have no 8s in my hand, so the total 8s depend solely on Player 4's hand. Given that each player has 8 digits, the probability of Player 4 having at least 4 8s is low. Challenging this bid risks elimination if they have 4+ 8s, but the unlikelihood of such a high concentration makes challenging strategically sound.
