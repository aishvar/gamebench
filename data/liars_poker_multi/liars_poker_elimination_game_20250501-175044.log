Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I have four 5s in my hand. Given the expected distribution of digits across all players, bidding 5 5s is statistically safe since there's a ~98.5% chance that at least one additional 5 exists in the remaining 40 digits. This minimizes the risk of being challenged successfully.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (meta-llama/llama-4-scout:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s made by Player 0. I have two 5s in my hand (60047200). To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have many high digits, increasing the quantity seems risky without knowing others' hands. However, bidding 6 5s is a possibility since my hand alone could contribute to this quantity. Bidding a higher digit with a low quantity might be more strategic. I have one 6 in my hand, so bidding 5 6s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and is supported by my hand.

Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 6s. I have one 6 in my hand (58416791). To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid on a higher digit. Since I see one 6, it's plausible others have 6s as well, but bidding more than 5 6s without strong evidence might be risky. However, I can bid on a higher digit. Bidding 5 7s is a valid move as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have a 9 in my hand. The current bid is 5 8s. Bidding 5 9s is a valid move, increasing the digit to a higher value while keeping the quantity the same, which is allowed by the rules.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 3/3
Player 5 Reasoning: I need to analyze the current situation. I have 8 digits in my hand: 18997075. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s. The current bid is '5 9s', meaning Player 4 believes there are at least 5 nines among all players. Since I have 2 nines in my hand, there would need to be at least 3 more nines among the other 5 players for this bid to be valid. With 6 players each having 8 digits, the distribution of digits should be roughly even, making about 4-5 of each digit expected in total. Since 9 is the highest digit, Player 4 has chosen a bid that cannot be raised in digit, only in quantity. Given that I have 2 nines myself, the bid of 5 nines seems reasonable and possibly true. To continue, I would need to bid '6 0s' or higher. I don't have many 0s in my hand (just one), so I'm not confident in bidding higher quantities of lower digits. I'll bid '6 0s' as it's the minimal valid raise.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have four 5s in my hand. Bidding 6 5s is a valid higher bid than 6 0s (same quantity, higher digit). Given my strong 5s presence, this bid seems plausible and strategic.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 6 5s made by Player 0. I have 8 secret digits: 60047200. I see that I have two 6s in my hand. Given that the current bid is 6 5s, I can increase the quantity or the digit to make a valid higher bid. Since my hand contains two 6s, bidding 7 6s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity from the current bid and utilizes the information from my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: The current bid is 7 6s. I have one 6 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have a lot of information about the other players' hands, I'll play it safe. I can bid 7 7s, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Alternatively, I could bid 8 0s or any other quantity higher than 7 with any digit. Given that there are 48 digits in total and the bids have been relatively conservative so far, bidding 8 6s seems reasonable as it slightly increases the quantity. However, I will choose to bid 7 7s as it's a safer and more conservative move.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains three 2s. The current bid is 1 0s, so bidding 3 2s increases the quantity and leverages my known digits, making it a strong and logical move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (18997075), I have zero 2s. Player 4 has bid 3 2s, meaning they believe there are at least 3 twos among all players. With 5 active players having 8 digits each (40 total digits), this bid is certainly possible. Since I don't have any 2s in my hand, the other 4 players would need to have at least 3 twos among them, which is quite reasonable (less than 1 per player on average). I could challenge, but it's risky given how low and reasonable the bid is. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 8, two 9s, one 7, one 0, and one 5. I could bid on 9s since I have two of them, making a bid of '3 9s' (same quantity, higher digit) or I could bid '4 0s' (higher quantity, lower digit). Since I only have one 0, bidding on 9s seems safer. I'll bid 3 9s.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have four 5s in my hand. The current bid of 3 9s requires at least three 9s in total. Since I only have one 9 and the average distribution suggests 9s might meet or exceed the bid, challenging is risky. Bidding 4 5s leverages my known 5s, ensuring the bid's validity regardless of others' hands, making it a safe and strategic higher bid.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is '4 5s' made by Player 0. I have 8 secret digits: 60047200. I see that I have two 6s and one 0, but no 5s. Given that I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than '4 5s', I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s, bidding '5 6s' seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit compared to the current bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: Looking at my hand (18997075), I have zero 2s. The current bid is 6 2s from Player 4. With 5 active players having 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits in play. For there to be at least 6 twos, the other 4 players would need to have at least 6 twos among their 32 digits (since I have none). While this is possible, Player 4 jumping from 5 7s to 6 2s - choosing a completely different digit - is suspicious. It suggests they might be bluffing. Additionally, in the previous round, Player 4 bid 5 9s, showing no particular affinity for 2s. Given I have no 2s in my hand and the bidding pattern, challenging seems reasonable.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s made by Player 0. I have 8 secret digits in my hand: 60047200. I can see that I have two 6s and no 5s. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32 and there are 32 total digits remaining, bidding a high quantity seems risky without knowing the distribution of digits among other players. However, I can try to make a reasonable bid based on my hand and the current bid. Since I have two 6s, bidding 2 6s seems reasonable, but I need to make a strictly higher bid than 4 5s. I can increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit seems more feasible since increasing the quantity to 5 or more might be risky without more information.

Player 4 Reasoning: My hand contains three 2s. The current bid is 1 0s, which is very low. Bidding 3 2s is a valid higher bid since the quantity (3) exceeds the current bid's quantity (1) and the digit (2) is higher than 0. This leverages my known cards to make a strong, defensible bid.

This bid is strictly higher than the current bid of 3 2s (via increased quantity) and ensures a guaranteed win if challenged, as my hand alone satisfies the minimum requirement.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have no 6s in my hand, making the total count of 6s entirely dependent on Player 4's hand. A bid of 4 6s requires Player 4 to have at least four 6s in their 8-digit hand, which seems unlikely given the difficulty of concentrating such a high quantity of a single digit. Previous challenges against Player 4's bids (e.g., 6 2s being exactly valid) suggest they sometimes make truthful bids, but the risk of bluffing increases in late-game scenarios. However, the absence of 6s in my hand and the high threshold for validation make this bid suspicious. Challenging offers a chance to eliminate Player 4 if their bid is false.
