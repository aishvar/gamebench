Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. Opening with 4 2s means I only need one more 2 among the 40 unknown digits (5 other players × 8 digits), which is extremely likely (1 - 0.9^40 ≈ 0.985). This is a safe first bid that leverages my strong holding.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 2s. I have one '2' in my hand. Given there are 48 digits in total, having at least 4 twos is quite plausible. To raise the bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and increase the digit. I will bid 4 3s because I have one '3' in my hand, making this a reasonable and valid higher bid.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of '4 3s'. Looking at my hand (23143355), I have two 3s. Since there are 6 players with 8 digits each, there are 48 total digits in play. For the bid '4 3s' to be valid, we need at least 4 threes in total. I already have 2 threes, so we only need 2 more threes among the other 5 players (who have 40 digits total). This seems quite reasonable and likely to be true. Therefore, I should make a higher bid. I could bid '5 3s', but I'm not confident there are that many. Looking at my hand, I have three 5s, so I could confidently bid '4 5s', which is higher than '4 3s' because the digit is higher while keeping the same quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 5s. With 48 total digits, the expected average for any digit is 4.8, making 4 5s a very plausible bid and too risky to challenge this early. My hand is 76627261, which contains three 6s. Bidding 4 6s is the minimal valid increase (same quantity, next higher digit) and is strongly supported by my hand. It only requires one more 6 among the other 5 players (40 digits), which is statistically likely.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand, meaning at least 1 of the 4 bid 6s exists. The expected total count for any digit across 48 digits is ~4.8, making the bid of 4 6s statistically plausible. Challenging risks elimination due to the high likelihood the bid is valid. Instead, bidding 4 8s leverages my two 8s and follows the round's trend of incrementally increasing digits while maintaining the same quantity (4).

Player 5 Reasoning: I have zero 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, which seems high given that I have none. However, with 5 other players, it's possible that the other players have a combined total of 4 or more 8s. Since the bid is already at 4, I can either bid higher by increasing the digit (e.g., 4 9s) or challenge. Given that I have no 8s, challenging might be risky if others have multiple 8s. A safer move is to bid 4 9s, which is a higher digit and doesn't increase the quantity.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. Expecting about four more 2s among the other 40 digits, bidding 5 2s is plausible and raises the quantity above the current 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 1 (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 twos. I have one '2' in my hand (digits: 0,1,9,3,1,7,8,6), so including my hand, there must be at least 4 more '2's among the other 40 digits. Since '2' is a low digit and the quantity is only 5, it is plausible. The next valid bids must be higher than 5 2s. The next higher bids can be 5 3s or more quantity or same quantity but higher digit. I do not have any '3's, but I have one '6' and one '8'. Bidding 5 3s is risky since I have no '3's, but bidding 6 0s would be a significant jump. Bidding 5 3s is the smallest valid increase and likely safe, so I will bid 5 3s.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid is 5 3s, meaning there need to be at least 5 3s among all players. Since I have 2 of them, there would need to be at least 3 more 3s among the other 5 players, which is quite possible. I could challenge, but it's risky given my knowledge. Instead, I'll make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have three 5s, which gives me confidence to bid on 5s. I'll bid 5 5s, keeping the same quantity but increasing the digit value.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. There are 48 total digits, so the expected number of 5s is 4.8. The bid is plausible, making a challenge risky, especially since I hold zero 5s myself (meaning the 5 required 5s must come from the other 40 digits, where the expected number is 4). My hand is 76627261, containing three 6s, two 2s, and two 7s. A valid higher bid would be 5 6s or higher, or 6 of any digit. Bidding 5 6s is safe, requiring only 2 more 6s from the other 40 digits (where 4 are expected). However, bidding 6 6s is also strongly supported by my hand (requiring 3 more 6s from 40 digits, expected 4) and significantly increases the pressure on subsequent players. Given my three 6s and previous bid of 4 6s, escalating to 6 6s is a strong strategic move.

Requesting LLM action from Player 4 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 4 Reasoning: I have one 6 in my hand. The current bid of 6 6s requires at least five more 6s across the remaining 40 digits. Given the average expected count for any digit is ~4.8 (including my 6), the total required (6) is above average but not impossible. However, considering Player 3's aggressive bid and potential holdings, the probability of the bid being false is still significant. Challenging avoids the risk of overbidding while capitalizing on statistical improbability.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand, and with 5 players remaining (40 total digits), bidding 4 8s aligns with the average expected count (4 per digit) and leverages my existing cards.

Player 5 Reasoning: I have one 8 in my hand. With 4 active players besides me, it's possible that there are at least 4 8s in total. However, the bid is already at 4 8s, and I don't have strong evidence to suggest there are more. Challenging seems risky, so I'll make a conservative bid by increasing the digit to 9s, which I also have one of in my hand.

Player 0 Reasoning: I have three 2s in my hand. To beat the bid of 4 9s I must raise to quantity 5. Bidding 5 2s leverages my strong holding and, with an expected ~3.2 additional 2s among the 32 unknown cards, gives a high probability (~84%) of at least two more to reach five.

Player 1 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 2s. I have one '2' in my hand but not many of the lower digits. The previous bids were mostly around 4 or 5 quantity with various digits. Since the bid must be strictly higher, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity and raise the digit. Bidding 5 3s or 5 4s would be higher but I already see a previous 5 3s bid earlier, so bidding 5 3s is valid and reasonable given the total digits. I don't think the bid of 5 2s is too high to challenge yet, so I will bid higher to keep the game going.

Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 3s in my hand. The current bid is 5 3s, meaning Player 1 believes there are at least 5 threes among all players. Since I have 2 of them, there would need to be at least 3 more 3s among the other 4 players, which is certainly possible but not guaranteed. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, which gives me confidence to bid 5 5s. This maintains the same quantity but increases the digit, making it a valid higher bid. Based on the previous round, I successfully bid 5 5s before, so I'll stick with that strategy.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 5 5s. Bidding 5 8s follows the 'same quantity, higher digit' rule and leverages my own 8s to support the bid. This is a reasonable escalation since 8s are relatively high and I have direct evidence of their presence.

Player 2 Reasoning: I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge Player 1's bid of 5 3s. Looking at my hand (23143355), I have two 3s. Since Player 1 bid 5 3s, there would need to be 3 more 3s among the other three players' hands to make this bid valid. With 8 digits per player and 4 active players, there are 32 total digits. The probability of having 3s in other players' hands is reasonable. Additionally, Player 1 might have some 3s in their hand, making their bid even more likely to be valid. I have three 5s in my hand, so I could confidently bid 5 5s, which is higher than 5 3s (same quantity, higher digit). This is a safe and strategic move based on my hand composition.

Player 4 Reasoning: The current bid is 5 5s. I have 0 5s in my hand. With 3 other players holding 24 digits total, the probability of at least 5 5s existing across their hands is uncertain but seems low given the average expectation of ~3.2 5s in 32 random digits. Previous aggressive bids (e.g., 5 2s, 5 3s) suggest players are focusing on specific digits, which might reduce the likelihood of multiple 5s. Challenging avoids risking an unlikely higher bid.

Since Player 1 must have at least two 9s for the bid to be valid, this is a high-risk challenge. However, with limited digits remaining and the bid being exactly at the threshold of plausibility, challenging leverages the possibility that Player 1 is bluffing or overestimating the count.
