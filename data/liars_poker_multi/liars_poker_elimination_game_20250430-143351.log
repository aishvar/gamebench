Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first bidder and the current bid is None. I need to make a valid bid. My hand is 18553938. I have two 5s, two 8s, and two 3s. A safe starting bid is usually based on your strongest digit count plus an estimate for other players. Bidding 3 5s seems reasonable as I have two, and with 5 other players, it's likely there's at least one more 5 among them.

Player 1 Reasoning: I have the digits 7, 8, 9, 2, 9, 4, 5, 0. Counting the 5s in my hand, I see one 5. The current bid is 3 5s, which is quite high given my hand. Since I only have one 5, I cannot logically raise the bid to 4 5s. The total number of 5s across all players is unlikely to reach 4, especially since only 8 digits are held per player. Challenging the current bid seems reasonable, as the total count of 5s across all hands is probably less than 4.

Player 0 Reasoning: I am the first bidder in this round with 5 players and 40 total digits. I have two 5s, two 8s, and two 3s in my hand. A bid of 3 5s seems reasonable given my hand and the total number of digits.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have two 5s in my hand (08507785), and Player 0 has bid 3 5s. Given that Player 0 made the same bid that previously won when the actual count was 7, and they're likely confident about 5s, I should be cautious about challenging. Since I know there are at least 2 fives (in my hand), their bid of 3 is quite reasonable. I should make a higher bid. With two 7s in my hand, bidding 3 7s is a safe play - it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 7s and two 8s in my hand. The current bid of 3 7s requires at least one more 7 in the remaining 32 digits. Since 7s are relatively common and Player 2 made the bid, challenging risks elimination. Bidding 3 8s (same quantity, higher digit) leverages my two 8s and shifts the pressure to the next player, as there's a plausible chance of finding at least one more 8 across four other hands.

Player 4 Reasoning: I have three 1s in my hand and with 40 digits total we expect about four of each digit on average. The current bid of 3 8s is plausible so I should raise quantity. Bidding 4 1s leverages my three 1s and is a realistic increase in quantity.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 1s. In my hand (53149327), I have only one '1'. With 5 players and 8 digits each, there are 40 digits in play. The expected number of '1's is about 4 (40/10). Since I only have one, unless several other players have more than average, 4 is plausible but not obviously high. However, with no evidence that the bid is particularly risky, and since challenging at this stage is not statistically favorable, the best move is to increase the bid. I will bid 4 2s, as I have one '2' and it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, which is a minimal escalation.

Requesting LLM action from Player 0 (google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 0 Reasoning: My hand contains two 8s and two 5s. The current bid is 4 2s. I have no 2s in my hand. Based on my hand, I have a good chance of there being more 8s or 5s among the remaining players. Bidding 4 8s seems like a reasonable increase over 4 2s, as I have two 8s myself and there are 40 digits total. This is a stronger bid than 4 5s given my hand.

Requesting LLM action from Player 2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022), Attempt 1/3
Player 2 Reasoning: I have 2 eights in my hand (08507785). Player 0 bid 4 8s, and I can see exactly how many exist in my hand. Since there are 5 players with 8 digits each, there are 40 total digits. For the bid to be true, there need to be at least 2 more eights in the other players' hands. Given that I've seen multiple players pass on challenging lower bids, and I have 2 eights myself, this seems like a reasonable bid. The next valid bid would need to be either 4 9s or 5 of any digit. With 5 being a significant portion of the remaining digits, I'll make a conservative bid of 4 9s.

Requesting LLM action from Player 3 (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-04-28:floor), Attempt 1/3
Player 3 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 9s. I have no 9s in my hand, and the expected total number of 9s across all 40 digits is around 4. However, since I have zero 9s, the remaining players' hands would need to contain all 4+ 9s to satisfy the bid. Using binomial probability estimates, there's approximately a 59% chance the actual count is less than 4, making this bid likely false. Challenging offers a statistically favorable risk/reward scenario.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. With 3 remaining opponents and 24 unknown digits, the expected number of 8s in their hands is approximately 2.4. Combined with my two, this suggests a total of around 4.4, making a bid of 4 8s statistically reasonable.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Previous rounds showed that 4 8s were valid when bid, indicating a potentially high count. With 24 total digits across 3 players, bidding 4 8s aligns with historical data and probabilistic expectations (average ~3.6 total 8s). This bid leverages my known digits and applies pressure for later challenges.

Requesting LLM action from Player 5 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Attempt 1/3
Player 5 Reasoning: The current bid is 4 8s. In my hand (53149327), I have no 8s. With 24 digits in total and only 8 of them known to me (none are 8), it's plausible but not certain that there could be 4 8s among the other 16 digits. However, given the previous round where exactly 4 8s were present with 32 digits, it's less likely there are 4 8s now with only 24 digits. Statistically, 8s should appear about 2.4 times in 24 digits. Since I have none, the other two players would need to collectively hold all 4 or more 8s, which is unlikely. Therefore, I should challenge.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. Starting the bidding with 3 8s is reasonable since it's plausible the opponent has at least one 8, especially given previous rounds where 8s were successfully bid. This follows the pattern of incrementally higher bids on strong digits.

Player 0 Reasoning: The current bid is 3 8s. I have two 8s in my hand. With 16 total digits, an average distribution would be 1.6 of each digit. Having two 8s is above average. Player 3 just bid 3 8s. It's possible they have one or more 8s as well, making 3 8s a plausible bid. However, I have two 8s, so I know there are at least two 8s in total. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable increase based on my hand and the current bid.

Player 3 Reasoning: I have two 8s in my hand. The current bid is 4 8s, meaning there must be at least 4 total 8s across both players. Since I have two, Player 0 must have at least two. However, under uniform probability assumptions for Player 0's unknown hand, the likelihood of them having two or more 8s is low (~18.7%). This makes the bid statistically unlikely to be valid. Challenging is favorable given the high probability of the bid being false.
