        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the game is between two players, each with 8 secret digits. My hand is 55176308. I need to make a bid or challenge, but since the current bid is None, I have to start the bidding.\n\nLooking at my hand: 5, 5, 1, 7, 6, 3, 0, 8. Let me count how many of each digit I have.\n\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 1\n- 3: 1\n- 5: 2\n- 6: 1\n- 7: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nSo, I have two 5s and one each of the other digits. Since I don't know the opponent's digits, I need to make an educated guess about what's a safe bid.\n\nThe rules say that the first bid can be any quantity and digit, but it's important to not overbid. Since I have two 5s, I can consider bidding on 2 5s. That's a safe start because I know I have at least two. Alternatively, I could bid on a higher quantity of a digit I have only one of, but that's riskier because the opponent might have none or several.\n\nBidding 2 5s seems reasonable. It's a low bid, which is good because it's less likely to be challenged. If I bid higher, like 3 of a digit I only have one of, the opponent might challenge, and I could lose. So sticking with what I know is safer.\n\nI don't think I should challenge because there's no prior bid to challenge. The current bid is None, so my only option is to make the first bid. Therefore, I'll go with 2 5s.\n"
