        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 2s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

The total number of 2s could be 1 (mine) plus potentially some in the opponent's hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. If I bid 4 2s, that might be risky if the opponent has none. Alternatively, I can bid 3 3s, which is a safer increase in digit. However, considering the opponent might have a 2, 3 3s could still be challenged. Another option is to go for a higher digit where I have some confidence. Looking at my hand (9,5,1,7,3,1,8,5), I have two 5s and two 1s. Bidding 4 5s might be possible if the opponent has at least two 5s, but that's uncertain. Alternatively, since I have two 1s, maybe the total 1s could be higher. But the opponent's bid was 3 2s, so they might have some 2s. To minimize risk, challenging might not be the best yet because 3 2s could be possible. Instead, making a conservative higher bid like 4 2s or 3 5s. Between these, 3 5s is safer because I know I have two 5s, so even if the opponent has one, that makes 3. But the bid requires strictly higher, so 3 5s is higher than 3 2s. That seems like a better move than increasing quantity. So I'll go with 3 5s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 5s\"\n}",
