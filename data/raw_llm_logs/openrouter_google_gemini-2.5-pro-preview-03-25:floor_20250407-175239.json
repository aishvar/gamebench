I have two 4s and two 5s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. The total number of digits across both players is 16. The expected count for any digit is 1.6. Bidding on one of my frequent digits is a good strategy. A bid of '3 Fours' is a reasonable starting point. I hold two 4s, so this bid requires the opponent to have at least one 4 among their 8 digits. The probability of the opponent having at least one 4 is 1 - (9/10)^8, which is approximately 57%. This makes the bid plausible and puts some pressure on the opponent without being overly aggressive.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 4\"\n}\n```",
