My hand is 89721662, which contains one 7. Given that the current bid is '1 7s', to make a higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 7 in my hand, bidding higher on 7s is not possible. I should look for another digit that appears more than once or a higher digit. In my hand, the digit 6 appears twice. The bid history shows that Player 1 bid '1 7s' after Player 0 bid '1 6s'. I can make a bid on 6s with a quantity higher than 1 or bid on a different digit with a quantity of 1 or more if it's higher than 7. My best move is to bid on 6s with a quantity of 2 because it's a valid higher bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 6s\"\n}\n```",
