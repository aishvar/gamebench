For the bid to be valid, there must be at least two 9s across both hands. Since I have one, the opponent must have at least one more 9 to make their bid true. The probability that the opponent has at least one 9 in their 8 digits is moderate, but not guaranteed. However, it's risky to challenge at this level because two 9s is quite plausible. A safe strategy is to raise the bid slightly to maintain pressure. The natural next bid would be 3 of a digit or 2 of a higher digit (but 9 is the highest). So, the minimal valid raise is 3 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, so bidding 3 5s seems reasonable as I hold two of them, needing only one more in the opponent's hand, which is plausible.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 5\"\n}",
