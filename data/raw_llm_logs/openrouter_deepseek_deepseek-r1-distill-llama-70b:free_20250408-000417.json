        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '1 0s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, let's try to figure out what to do here. So, it's my turn in this game of Liar's Poker. The current bid is 1 0s by Player 0, who's playing as Naive 50/50. My hand is 68625910, which I need to analyze carefully.\n\nFirst, I should count how many of each digit I have. Let me list them out: 6, 8, 6, 2, 5, 9, 1, 0. So, I have two 6s, one 8, one 2, one 5, one 9, one 1, and one 0. That means in my hand, the counts are 0:1, 1:1, 2:1, 5:1, 6:2, 8:1, 9:1. The rest are zero.\n\nNow, the current bid is 1 0s. Since I have one 0, that's exactly what's bid. But I know that the total number of 0s could be more if Player 0 has any. But Player 0 is a Naive 50/50 player, which might mean they're making random bids, maybe not based on their actual hand. So, they might be bluffing or just starting low.\n\nI need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. If I challenge, and the total 0s are exactly 1, then the bid is valid, and I lose. If it's more, the bid is still valid. But if it's less, I win. However, since I have one 0, the minimum total is 1, and the maximum could be up to whatever Player 0 has. But since each player has 8 digits, the maximum 0s possible is 8 (if Player 0 has 7 0s, but that's unlikely). But realistically, it's probably low.\n\nOn the other hand, I could try to make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 1 0s, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Let's see, what digits do I have multiple of? I have two 6s. So, maybe I can bid 2 6s. That would be a higher bid because 2 > 1, and the digit is 6, which is higher than 0. Alternatively, I could bid a higher digit with the same quantity, but since 0 is the lowest, any digit higher would work.\n\nBut wait, if I bid 2 6s, I know I have two, but Player 0 might have none or some. The total could be 2 or more, which would make my bid valid. Alternatively, I could go for a higher quantity on a digit I have only one of, but that might be riskier.\n\nAnother option is to challenge. If I challenge and the total 0s are exactly 1, I lose. But considering that Player 0 might have at least one 0, maybe more, challenging might not be the best move. Plus, since the bid is so low, it's easy to overbid.\n\nI think the safer move is to make a bid. Since I have two 6s, bidding 2 6s seems reasonable. It's a higher quantity and a higher digit than the current bid, so it's a valid move. Plus, it's not too high, so the chance that the total meets it is decent.\n\nSo, I'll decide to bid 2 6s.\n"
