You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to decide my first move in this Liar's Poker game. Since the current bid is None, I have to make the initial bid. My hand is 57705661. Let me look at the digits I have.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the digits in my hand: 5, 7, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, 1. Let me count how many of each digit I have:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 1\n- 5: 2 (positions 1 and 5)\n- 6: 2 (positions 6 and 7)\n- 7: 2 (positions 2 and 3)\n- The other digits (like 2,3,4,8,9) I have 0 of in my hand.\n\nSince I'm starting, I need to bid something that's a good opening move. The bid has to be a quantity and a digit. The bid must be higher than \"None\", so any bid is valid here. But I should choose a bid that's plausible but maybe a bit aggressive to set a good baseline.\n\nLooking at my counts, the highest counts I have are 2 for 5,6,7. But since the total possible digits are 16 (8 each from both players), I need to consider what's possible. If I bid 3 of a digit I have some of, maybe that's safe. Alternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity to make it believable.\n\nWait, but in the first bid, people often go for lower numbers. Let me think. The minimum bid could be 1 of any digit, but that's too weak. Maybe starting with 3 of a common digit? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe pick a digit that's common in general. For example, if I bid 3 7s, since I have two 7s, maybe the opponent has one, making it 3 total. But since I don't know their hand, I have to guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 4 of a digit. Wait, but that's riskier. Let me think of the probabilities. Since each player has 8 digits, the total is 16. The maximum possible for any digit is 16, but realistically, the counts would vary.\n\nSince I have two 5s, two 6s, and two 7s, maybe choosing one of those. Let's pick 7s. If I bid 3 7s, then the total could be possible. Alternatively, maybe 3 6s? Or 3 5s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity. Wait, but the first bid can be anything. Maybe starting with 3 of a digit I have two of. That way, even if the opponent has one, it's 3. But if they have none, then it's 2, so challenging that would be possible. Hmm, but as the first bidder, I need to set a bid that others will have to top or challenge.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit to make it more appealing. For example, if I bid 3 7s, since 7 is a higher digit than 5 or 6, that might be better. Because if someone else wants to bid the same quantity, they have to go higher in digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 4 7s? But that's risky because I only have two. Unless I'm bluffing. But since I'm starting, maybe it's better to be cautious. Let's see: if I bid 3 7s, then the opponent can either bid higher quantity, or same quantity with a higher digit. Since I have two, maybe that's a reasonable bid. Alternatively, bid 3 5s. But 5 is lower than 7. \n\nAlternatively, maybe pick the highest digit I have in quantity. Since 7,6,5 all have two each, but 7 is the highest. So maybe 3 7s. Let's go with that. \n\nWait, but what if the opponent has none? Then the total is 2, so if someone challenges, my bid of 3 would be wrong. But as the first move, maybe it's better to start with a bid that's plausible. Since each player has 8 digits, the chance that another player has a 7 is possible but not certain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 9s, but I have zero 9s. That would be a lie, but maybe that's a bluff. But as a first bid, maybe it's better to have some basis. Since I have two 7s, bidding 3 7s gives me a better chance if they have at least one. \n\nAlternatively, start with a lower quantity. Maybe 2 9s? But that's a higher digit but I have none. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, bid 4 0s. Wait, I have one 0, so maybe that's risky. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, the safest first bid might be 3 of a digit I have some of. Let's see. Let me check the digits again. My digits are 5,7,7,0,5,6,6,1. So, the counts:\n\n0:1, 1:1, 5:2, 6:2, 7:2. \n\nSo the digits with counts 2 are 5,6,7. \n\nIf I bid 3 of any of those, maybe 3 7s. Let's go with that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 3 9s as a bluff. But since I have none, that's a higher digit but risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower digit but higher quantity. For example, 4 0s. But I have one 0, so that's 1, so 4 would require the opponent to have 3, which is possible but maybe too much. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best starting bid is 3 of a digit I have two of. Let's pick the highest digit possible. 7 is the highest among those with count 2. So 3 7s. That seems reasonable. \n\nSo my reasoning would be that I have two 7s, so bidding 3 7s gives a plausible bid, assuming the opponent might have at least one. That's better than a lower digit. So the action would be BID: 3 7s.\n"
