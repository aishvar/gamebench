You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. I have the hand 97313705, which are my eight secret digits. The game is between two players, and it's my turn. The current bid is None, which means I have to make the first bid.\n\nSince there's no previous bid, I can bid any quantity and digit as long as it's a valid bid. But I should aim to make a bid that's likely to be true based on my hand and the possible digits the other player might have. \n\nLooking at my hand: 9,7,3,1,3,7,0,5. Let me count the digits I have. I have two 3s, two 7s, one 0, one 1, one 5, and one 9. The other player has eight digits as well, so the total number of any digit can be between 0 and 16.\n\nI need to decide on a bid that's higher than None, so the first bid can be anything, but ideally, it should be something I think is achievable. Let's think about which digits I have multiple of. I have two 3s and two 7s. Maybe I can bid on one of those.\n\nIf I bid on 3s, I have two. The other player might have some 3s as well. But how many? It's possible they have zero, one, two, etc. The maximum total is 16, but realistically, it's unlikely someone has more than, say, four of the same digit unless they're trying to bluff.\n\nAlternatively, if I bid on 7s, I have two. But again, the other player might have some. Maybe I should consider the digits I have more of. Or perhaps go for a higher digit to make the bid stronger.\n\nWait, but since it's the first bid, I can set the bar. Maybe I should start low to not give away too much information. But I also want to make a bid that's likely to be true so that if someone challenges, I can win.\n\nLet me think about the digits I have. I have two 3s. If I bid 3 3s, that would mean there are at least three 3s in total. Considering I have two, the other player would need at least one. That's possible. Alternatively, if I bid 2 3s, that's even safer, but since I have to make the first bid, maybe starting with 3 3s is a good middle ground.\n\nAnother option is to look at the digits I have more of. I have two 3s and two 7s. Maybe I can bid on 7s. If I bid 3 7s, that would require the other player to have at least one 7. If they don't, then the total would be two, which is less than the bid, and I would lose if challenged. But since it's the first bid, maybe it's better to start with a lower quantity but a higher digit.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the digits that are less common. For example, 0s or 9s. I have one 0 and one 9. If I bid on 0s, saying 1 0s, but that's the minimum, and it's not higher than None. Wait, no, the first bid can be any quantity and digit. So I could bid 1 0s, but that's probably too low. Maybe I should aim higher.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 5s. I have one 5. If I bid 2 5s, that would mean the other player has at least one 5. That's possible, but I'm not sure. It's a bit risky.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the digits that are more likely to appear multiple times. For example, 1s, 3s, 5s, 7s, 9s are odd digits, which might be less common than even digits. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 7s. I have two, so if I bid 3 7s, that would require the other player to have at least one. It's possible, but maybe a bit risky.\n\nWait, another approach: since I have two 3s, maybe I can bid 4 3s. That would be a higher bid, but I'm not sure if the other player has two 3s. That would make the total four. But if they don't, then the bid would be too high, and I'd lose if challenged.\n\nHmm, maybe it's safer to start with a lower bid. Let's see, I have two 3s. If I bid 3 3s, that's a reasonable bid. It's higher than None, and it's based on my hand. The other player might have one or two 3s, making the total three or four, which would make my bid valid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 7s. I have two, so 3 7s. That's also a possibility. But I'm not sure which digit is better to bid on.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the digits that are less likely to be in the other player's hand. For example, if I bid on 9s, I have one. If I bid 2 9s, that would mean the other player has at least one. But if they don't, then the bid is invalid. So that's a bit risky.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 0s. I have one, so 2 0s. But again, if the other player doesn't have any, the bid is invalid.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should go with the digit I have the most of, which is 3s and 7s, both with two. Let me choose 3s. So I'll bid 3 3s. That seems reasonable. I have two, so the other player needs at least one. It's possible, and if they don't, then the bid is invalid, but since I'm the first to bid, it's a calculated risk.\n\nWait, but I could also consider the digits that are higher. For example, if I bid on 7s, which is a higher digit, it might be easier to make a higher bid later. But since it's the first bid, maybe starting with 3s is better.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 9s, which is the highest digit I have. If I bid 2 9s, that's a higher digit, which might make it harder for the opponent to challenge. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think again. The goal is to make a bid that's likely to be true. I have two 3s, so if I bid 3 3s, that's a reasonable bid. The other player could have one or more, making the total three or more. It's a balanced bid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 7s. I have two, so 3 7s. That's also possible. But I'm not sure which is better.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the digits that are less likely to be in the opponent's hand. For example, if I bid on 3s, which are odd, maybe the opponent has fewer. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 0s, which are even. But I only have one.\n\nHmm, I think I'll go with 3 3s. It's a reasonable bid based on my hand, and it's a middle ground. I have two, so the opponent needs at least one, which is possible.\n"
