        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 3s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

To make a higher bid, I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since the current digit is 3, I can bid a higher digit with the same quantity. However, I don't have any 3s, so I might not want to risk a high quantity on 3s. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 3 and choose a digit I have more of. I have two 5s and two 7s, but maybe other players have some too. Bidding 3 5s could be possible, but I need to consider if that's safe. Alternatively, since the current bid is low, I can try to increase the digit to something higher that I have. For example, 3 7s. But I only have two 7s. If I bid 3 7s, the total might be 2 (mine) plus possibly some from the opponent. It's a bit risky. Alternatively, I can challenge the current bid. The current bid is 2 3s. How many 3s are there in total? I have none. If the opponent has at least two 3s, then the bid is valid. But since they bid 2 3s, they might have at least one or two. If I challenge and they have less than two, I win. But if they have two or more, I lose. It's a 50-50 chance. Alternatively, making a safe bid might be better. Let's see. If I bid 3 5s, since I have two 5s, maybe the opponent has one, making it three total. That could work. Or maybe they have none, making it two total, which would be a failed bid. But since they made the 2 3s bid, maybe they don't have many 5s. Alternatively, I can go for a higher digit. For example, 2 7s. But the current bid is 2 3s, so 2 7s is higher because the digit is higher. That's a valid bid. Since I have two 7s, and the opponent might have none, but even if they have one, the total would be three, which is more than 2. Wait, no. If I bid 2 7s, the quantity is the same as the current bid (2), but the digit is higher (7 > 3), so it's a valid higher bid. That seems safe because I have two 7s, so even if the opponent has zero, the total is two, which meets the bid. But the bid is 2 7s, which would be exactly two. But in Liar's Poker, the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So if I bid 2 7s, and there are exactly two, it's valid. Since I have two, I can be confident that the total is at least two. Therefore, bidding 2 7s is a safe move. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 3. If I bid 3 7s, but I only have two, so the opponent needs to have at least one. If they don't, the bid is invalid, and I might be challenged. But since they just bid 2 3s, maybe they don't have many 7s. It's risky. So the safest bet is to bid 2 7s, which is higher than 2 3s because of the digit, and I can confirm that there are at least two 7s. Therefore, I should make that bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 7s\"\n}",
