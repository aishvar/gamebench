        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, my hand is 23884909. Let me count how many of each digit I have. Breaking it down:\n- 2: once\n- 3: once\n- 8: twice\n- 4: once\n- 9: twice\n- 0: once\n\nSo, I have two 9s and two 8s. The current bid is 3 5s, made by Player 0. My goal is to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid.\n\nLet me think about the possible counts. Since each player has 8 digits, the total number of digits in play is 16. If Player 0 bid 3 5s, that means they're claiming there are at least three 5s between both players. \n\nI don't have any 5s in my hand. So, if I challenge, the total number of 5s would have to be at least 3. But since I have zero, Player 0 must have at least 3 5s. Is that possible? They have 8 digits, so they could have 3, 4, or more 5s.\n\nBut wait, if I challenge and the total is less than 3, I win. If it's 3 or more, Player 0 wins. Since I have none, Player 0 must have all the 5s. So, they need at least 3. Is that likely? Well, it's possible, but maybe not super likely. But I don't have any 5s, so I can't confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 3 5s, I can either bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s and two 9s. \n\nIf I bid 3 8s, that would be a valid bid because 8 is higher than 5, and the quantity is the same. Or I could bid 2 9s, but that's lower than 3 5s, so it's not allowed. Wait, no, because 3 is higher than 2, so I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. \n\nWait, the rules say a bid must be strictly higher. So, same quantity but higher digit is acceptable. So, 3 8s would be higher than 3 5s because 8 > 5. Alternatively, I could bid 4 of a lower digit, but I don't have enough of any digit except maybe 8 or 9.\n\nI have two 8s and two 9s. So, if I bid 3 8s, I'm claiming there are at least three 8s in total. Since I have two, Player 0 must have at least one. Is that possible? They could have one, two, or more. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 9s, but that's a lower quantity than 3, so it's not a valid bid. So, the best option is to bid 3 8s. That way, I'm increasing the digit, which makes it a higher bid. \n\nI think making a bid is better than challenging because if I challenge and lose, I lose the game. But if I bid and they challenge, I can win if the total is at least 3. Since I have two 8s, and if Player 0 has at least one, I'm safe. \n\nSo, I'll go with bidding 3 8s.\n"
