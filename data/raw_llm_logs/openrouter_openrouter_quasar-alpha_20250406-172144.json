Since I only have one, the opponent must have at least one or be bluffing. The total number of digits is 16, so having two 8s is plausible. However, since I have one, it's also quite likely the opponent has one or zero. Because the naive player may overestimate or bluff, challenging now could be profitable. Alternatively, I could make a minimal higher bid like '2 9s', since I also hold one '9', making it plausible. This keeps pressure on the opponent and gathers more information. Given the moderate plausibility of the current bid and my decent hand, a minimal raise is safer than an early challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"2 9s\"\n}",
