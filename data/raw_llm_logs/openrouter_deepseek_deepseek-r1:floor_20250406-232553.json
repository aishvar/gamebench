You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I need to make the first bid in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding my hand. My hand is 1, 3, 2, 9, 4, 9, 9, 2. Let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\nLooking at each digit:\n- 0s: 0\n- 1s: 1\n- 2s: 2\n- 3s: 1\n- 4s: 1\n- 5s: 0\n- 6s: 0\n- 7s: 0\n- 8s: 0\n- 9s: 3\n\nSo in my hand, the most frequent digit is 9, with three of them. Then 2s with two, and 1, 3, 4 each once. Since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total digits in play are 16. The opponent could have any combination, but I have to make a bid based on my own hand and what's likely.\n\nSince the current bid is None, I can start with any valid bid. The first bid should be something that's plausible but not too high, to avoid getting challenged immediately. The lowest possible bid would be 1 of any digit, but I want to start with a bit higher based on my hand to set the tone.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have three 9s. That's a strong point. If I bid on 9s, I can start with maybe 3 or 4. But since I have three 9s, the opponent could have up to 5 more (since total possible is 8, but they have 8 digits, but digits can be any). Wait, wait, total possible for any digit is 16 (since 2 players, 8 each). But in reality, digits are 0-9, so the maximum any single digit can have is 16 (if both players have all 8 of that digit). But that's highly unlikely. \n\nBut since I have three 9s, maybe the opponent has one or two more. So total could be up to 3 + 8 (if the opponent has all 9s, which is possible but unlikely). But that's a stretch. However, since it's the first bid, I can start with a bid that's based on my own count plus a reasonable assumption. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower digit that I have, but higher frequency. For example, I have two 2s. If I bid two 2s, that's a low bid. But maybe I can go higher. Since the first bid can be anything, maybe I should start with a bid that's a bit higher than the minimum but still safe. \n\nAlternatively, since I have three 9s, starting with 3 9s is a natural choice. That's a true statement (since I have three, and the opponent could have more, but even if they have none, the total is three, so the bid would be valid. Wait, no. Wait, if I bid 3 9s, and the actual total is exactly three (if opponent has none), then if someone challenges, I would win because the count is equal to the bid. So bidding 3 9s is safe because I have three, and the opponent might have some, but even if they don't, it's exactly three. So that's a safe starting bid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go a little higher. For example, bid 4 9s. But if I bid 4 9s, then I need the opponent to have at least one more 9. But if they have none, the total is three, which is less than four, so if they challenge, I lose. So that's risky. \n\nSince it's the first bid, perhaps starting with a lower quantity but higher digit might not be necessary. Wait, the rules say the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid, but since the current bid is None, any bid is allowed. So I can start with the lowest possible, but maybe better to start with a higher bid based on my hand to put pressure on the opponent. \n\nLooking at my digits again: 9s are three, 2s are two. Let's see, if I bid 3 9s, that's a valid bid. If the opponent has any 9s, the total is higher. If not, it's exactly three. So that's a safe bid. Alternatively, I could bid 2 9s, but that's lower than my actual count, which might not be strategic. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid a digit that's lower than 9 but with a higher quantity. For example, I have two 2s. Bidding 4 2s would require the opponent to have two more 2s. But that's possible. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the total possible digits are 16, but realistically, the opponent's hand could have any distribution. But starting with a bid that's based on my own hand is safer. \n\nSo the best initial bid would be 3 9s. That's a strong starting point because I have three, and if the opponent has at least one, it's correct. Even if they have none, the bid is still valid (since 3 is the count). So that's a safe opening move. Therefore, I should bid 3 9s.\n"
