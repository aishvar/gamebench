        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let's see, the game state says it's my turn, and the current bid is None. That means I'm the first to make a bid. My hand is 87649340. Hmm, let me count the digits I have.\n\nLooking at my hand: 8, 7, 6, 4, 9, 3, 4, 0. So, I have two 4s, and one each of 8,7,6,9,3,0. So the digits I have are 0,3,4,4,6,7,8,9.\n\nSince I'm starting the bid, I need to pick a digit and a quantity. I have to think about what's a safe bid. I have two 4s, so maybe I can bid 2 4s. But wait, is that the best move? Let me think about possible digits that might be common.\n\nAlternatively, I have a single 0, which is a low digit. Maybe bidding 1 0s is possible, but that's a very low bid and might not be strategic. On the other hand, I have two 4s, which is a moderate digit. Bidding 2 4s seems reasonable because it's based on my hand, and it's a starting point.\n\nI don't want to bid too high because the opponent might challenge, and if they do, I could lose if the total count doesn't meet the bid. So, starting with a bid that I can at least match with my own hand makes sense. Since I have two 4s, I can confidently say that at least two 4s exist in the game. Unless the opponent has zero 4s, which is possible, but that's a risk I have to take.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit, like 6,7,8, or 9, but I only have one of each. So bidding 1 6s or higher might not be as strong because it's a lower quantity. Bidding 2 4s is better because the quantity is higher, making it a more substantial bid.\n\nI think I'll go with BID: 2 4s. It's a safe starting point, and I have the cards to back it up. Plus, it's a moderate bid that doesn't overcommit me, giving me room to maneuver in future turns.\n"
