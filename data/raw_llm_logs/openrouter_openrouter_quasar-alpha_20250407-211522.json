The current bid is 3 zeros, which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 3 zeros total between both hands. Since I only have 1 zero, Player 0 must have at least 2 zeros for the bid to be valid. Given the naive 50/50 strategy and the typical distribution, having 2 or more zeros in Player 0's hand is plausible but not highly likely. The probability of Player 0 holding 2 or more zeros in 8 digits is roughly 33%, making the total of 3 zeros somewhat unlikely. Therefore, challenging is a reasonable move here rather than increasing the bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
