                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I'm Player 0, and my hand is 97646788. So I need to make the first bid since the current bid is None. The game is Liar's Poker, right? Each player has 8 digits, so total digits in play are 16. \n\nFirst, I should look at my own hand to figure out what digits I have. Let me count them. My hand is 9,7,6,4,6,7,8,8. So breaking that down: 9 appears once, 7 appears twice, 6 appears twice, 4 once, and 8 twice. So the counts in my hand are: 9(1), 7(2), 6(2), 4(1), 8(2). \n\nSince I'm the first to bid, I can start with any digit and quantity. The goal is to set a bid that's plausible but also not too easy for the opponent to challenge. But since there's no prior bid, I have to start. \n\nI need to choose a digit that I have a decent number of, so that even if the opponent has some, the total could be reasonable. Let's see. The digits I have multiple of are 7, 6, and 8, each with two. So maybe pick one of those. \n\nIf I bid on 7s, I have two. The opponent could have 0, 1, or more. So if I bid, say, 3 7s, that would mean the opponent has at least one. But maybe that's a bit risky. Alternatively, 2 7s would be safe because I have two, but the opponent might have more. Wait, but the bid has to be strictly higher than the current bid, which is None. Wait, no, the first bid can be any quantity and digit. Wait, the rules say \"Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" Wait, how does that work? Because 'None' is the current bid, so the first bid can be any valid bid, right? Because there's nothing to compare. Wait, the description says: \"Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" Hmm, maybe that's a typo. Because if the current bid is None, then any bid is allowed. Because there's no previous bid to be higher than. So maybe the first player can start with any bid. \n\nSo, for example, I can start with 1 of any digit. But to make a strategic bid, I should pick a digit that I have a few of, so that the total is likely to be higher. Let's think. If I have two 8s, maybe the opponent has some. Let's say I bid 3 8s. That would require the opponent to have at least one 8. If they have one, total is three, which meets the bid. If they have two, total is four. But if they have none, then the total is two, which is less than three, so if they challenge, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 8s, that's exactly what I have. But the opponent could have zero, making the total two. So 2 8s would be safe, but maybe too low. But since the first bid can be anything, maybe starting with a higher quantity. Wait, but the opponent has 8 digits, so the maximum possible for any digit is 16 (if all 16 digits are the same, but that's impossible here). \n\nWait, the maximum possible for any digit is 16, but each player has 8 digits. So the total possible for any digit is between 0 and 16. \n\nSo, for the first bid, I need to choose a quantity and digit that's a good starting point. Let's see. My hand has two 8s. If I bid 3 8s, that's a possible total if the opponent has at least one. But if they have none, then the total is two, which would make the bid invalid. So maybe that's risky. Alternatively, if I bid 2 8s, that's exactly what I have. But the opponent could have more. But if I bid 2 8s, then the next player has to bid higher, either in quantity (like 3 of any digit) or same quantity but higher digit (like 2 9s). \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, 2 9s. I have one 9. If the opponent has at least one, then the total is two. But if they have none, then the total is one, which would make the bid invalid. So that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe pick a digit that's lower, like 6. I have two 6s. If I bid 3 6s, opponent needs to have at least one. If they have one, total is three. If they have two, total is four. But again, if they have none, then total is two, which is less than three. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity but higher digit. For example, 2 7s. I have two 7s. If the opponent has any 7s, the total is at least two. So 2 7s is safe because even if the opponent has none, the total is two, which meets the bid. Wait, no. If I bid 2 7s, and the opponent has zero, then the total is two (my two), which is exactly the bid. So the bid is valid. Because the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So if I bid 2 7s, and the total is two, that's correct. So the bid is valid. So that's a safe bid. Because even if the opponent has none, the total is two. So I can bid 2 7s, and that's a valid bid. Then the opponent has to either bid higher (like 3 of any digit, or 2 8s, 2 9s). \n\nBut wait, the rules say that the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid. Since the current bid is None, the first bid can be any. So 2 7s is allowed. Then the next player has to bid higher than 2 7s. So they can bid 3 of any digit, or 2 8s, 2 9s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher quantity. For example, 4 6s. I have two 6s. The opponent would need to have at least two. But that's a bit risky. If the opponent has two, total is four. If they have one, total is three, which is less than four. So if I bid 4 6s, and the opponent challenges, then if they have two, total is four, I win. If they have one, total is three, I lose. \n\nBut since it's the first bid, maybe starting with a moderate bid. Let's think about the probabilities. The opponent has 8 digits. The chance that they have at least one of a certain digit. For example, for 7s: I have two. The opponent's chance of having at least one 7. There are 8 digits in their hand. The total number of digits in the deck is 16 (each player has 8). Wait, but in Liar's Poker, are the digits dealt from a standard deck? Like, in real Liar's Poker, it's using dollar bill serial numbers, but here it's probably a simulated deck. Assuming that all digits are equally likely, but the actual distribution depends on the dealing. But since the user hasn't specified, maybe we can assume that the opponent's hand is random. \n\nBut perhaps the best approach is to make a bid that's safe based on my own hand. For example, if I have two 7s, then the minimum total is two (if opponent has none), and maximum is 10 (if opponent has all 8 digits as 7s, which is impossible because I have two, so total would be 10, but the maximum possible is 16, but that's not possible here). Wait, no. Wait, each player has 8 digits. So total digits in play are 16. So for any digit, the maximum possible is 16 (if all 16 digits are the same). But in reality, that's impossible unless all 16 digits are the same. \n\nBut in my hand, I have two 7s. So the opponent could have up to 14 7s (if their 8 digits are all 7s, but that's 8, so total would be 2+8=10). Wait, no. If I have two 7s, the opponent can have up to 8 7s, making total 10. So the maximum possible for 7s is 10. \n\nBut that's very unlikely. So if I bid 2 7s, that's safe because even if the opponent has none, the total is two. So that's a guaranteed valid bid. Because the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So 2 7s is a safe bid. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 8s. I have two 8s. If the opponent has none, total is two. So that's also safe. Similarly for 6s. \n\nBut which digit to choose? Maybe pick the highest possible digit in my hand to make the next player's options harder. For example, if I bid 2 8s, the next player has to bid higher. They can bid 3 of any digit, or 2 9s. But 9 is higher than 8. But I have one 9. If they bid 2 9s, then the total would be my 1 plus their possible 9s. If they have, say, one 9, total is two, which meets the bid. But if they have none, total is one, which would make their bid invalid. So maybe they would avoid that. \n\nAlternatively, if I start with 2 8s, the next player might have to bid 3 of a lower digit, which could be risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher quantity but lower digit. For example, 3 6s. I have two 6s. If the opponent has at least one, then total is three or more. But if they have none, total is two, which is less than three. So that's a risky bid. \n\nBut as the first bid, maybe it's better to start with a safe bid. So 2 8s, 2 7s, or 2 6s. Which of these is better? \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, 1 9. I have one 9. If the opponent has at least one, total is two. But if they have none, total is one, which meets the bid. Wait, 1 9s: the bid is 1, so even if the opponent has none, the total is one (my one), which is exactly the bid. So that's a valid bid. So 1 9s is safe. Then the next player has to bid higher. They can bid 2 of any digit, or 1 of a higher digit (but 9 is the highest, so they can't do that). So they have to bid 2 of any digit. \n\nBut starting with 1 9s is very low. The opponent can then bid 2 of any digit, which might be easy. For example, they could bid 2 0s, which I have none. But if they have some 0s, that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, starting with a higher quantity. Let's think: if I bid 2 8s, that's safe. Then the opponent has to bid higher. They can bid 3 of any digit, or 2 9s. If they bid 3 0s, that's possible. But if they have, say, three 0s, then that's a valid bid. But if they don't, they might challenge. \n\nAlternatively, maybe starting with a bid that's more likely to be true. For example, since I have two 8s, and 8 is a higher digit, maybe bid 2 8s. That way, the opponent has to either bid higher quantity or a higher digit. But since 9 is the highest digit, they can't bid a higher digit unless they bid 9s. So if they bid 2 9s, that's possible. But I have one 9. If they have one 9, total is two, which meets their bid. If they have none, total is one, which would make their bid invalid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent will challenge if they think the bid is too high. So starting with a safe bid like 2 8s is good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher quantity but lower digit. For example, 3 4s. I have one 4. The opponent would need to have at least two 4s. If they have two, total is three. If they have one, total is two, which is less than three. So that's risky. \n\nHmm. So the safest first bid is to pick a digit that I have at least two of, and bid two of them. Because that way, even if the opponent has none, the total is two, which meets the bid. So options are 2 7s, 2 6s, or 2 8s. \n\nWhich of these is better? Maybe pick the highest digit possible to make the next bid harder. So 2 8s. Because then the next player has to bid either 3 of any digit or 2 9s. If they bid 2 9s, they need to have at least one 9. If they don't, then the total is one (my one), which is less than two, so their bid would be invalid. So they might be hesitant to bid 2 9s unless they have at least one. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 8s, and the opponent has, say, two 8s, then the total is four, which is more than two, so my bid is valid. But the opponent might challenge if they have none. Wait, no. If I bid 2 8s, and the opponent has none, the total is two (my two), which meets the bid. So the bid is valid. So they can't challenge successfully. Because the total is exactly two. \n\nSo bidding 2 8s is safe. Then the opponent has to make a higher bid. They can bid 3 of any digit, which could be risky, or 2 9s, which is possible if they have at least one 9. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 7s, the same logic applies, but the digit is lower. So the opponent can bid 2 8s or 2 9s, which are higher digits. \n\nSo maybe starting with 2 8s is better because it's a higher digit, making the opponent's options more limited. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 2 6s. But 6 is lower. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 2 7s. \n\nBut in any case, the safest first bid is to bid two of a digit I have two of. So the options are 2 7s, 2 6s, or 2 8s. \n\nLooking at my hand again: 9,7,6,4,6,7,8,8. So 7s: two, 6s: two, 8s: two. \n\nSo I can choose any of these. \n\nBut which one is better strategically? \n\nIf I bid 2 8s, the next player can bid 2 9s. But I have one 9. If they bid 2 9s, the total would be my 1 plus their count. If they have one, total is two, which meets their bid. If they have none, total is one, which is less than two. So they might not bid 2 9s unless they have at least one. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 7s, the next player can bid 2 8s, which I have two of. If they bid 2 8s, then the total is two (mine) plus their count. If they have two, total is four. So their bid is valid. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 6s, the next player can bid 2 7s, which I have two of. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to start with the highest digit possible in my hand to limit the opponent's options. So 8 is the highest digit I have. So bid 2 8s. That way, the opponent can't bid a higher digit unless they have 9s. \n\nSo the action would be to bid 2 8s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher quantity. For example, 3 6s. But that's risky. \n\nBut since it's the first bid, and I want to avoid being challenged immediately, it's better to start with a safe bid. So 2 8s.\n"
