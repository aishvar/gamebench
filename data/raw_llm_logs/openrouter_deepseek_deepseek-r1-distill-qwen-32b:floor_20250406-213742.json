You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

My hand is 31925976, which I can analyze to make the best move.\n\nFirst, I count the digits in my hand. Looking at 3,1,9,2,5,9,7,6. I have one 6. Since there are two players, the total digits in play are 16. The current bid is 2 6s, meaning there are supposed to be at least two 6s across both hands.\n\nI have one 6, so to meet the current bid, Player 0 must have at least one 6 as well. But is that likely? Player 0 could be bluffing. If I challenge, we'll reveal the actual count. If it's less than two, I win. If it's two or more, Player 0 wins.\n\nConsidering the maximum possible is 16, but 2 6s is relatively low. With only 8 digits each, the chance that Player 0 actually has another 6 is moderate. However, since I have one, it's possible they have one too. But maybe they're trying to bluff and I can call it.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid higher. The next valid bid would be either 3 6s or 2 7s. But I don't have any 7s, so 2 7s isn't a good option. Bidding 3 6s would require that there are at least three 6s, but I only have one. It's a risk because Player 0 might not have two.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, challenging seems safer. If Player 0 is bluffing, I can win. If they're truthful, I lose, but the risk might be worth it given the current bid.\n"
