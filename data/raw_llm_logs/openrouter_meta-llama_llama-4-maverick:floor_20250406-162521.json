        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '9 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

Given that I have the digits 56389377, I can see I have one 6. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in my opponent's, making a total of 16 digits. The current bid of 9 6s implies that my opponent has 8 6s, which is possible but unlikely since it would mean they have all the remaining 6s. However, I do have a 7 and other digits. I can bid higher than 9 6s by bidding 9 7s or 10 0s (since 0 is the lowest digit and 10 is higher than 9). I have one 7, so bidding 9 7s seems feasible if I believe my opponent has a good number of 7s. Alternatively, increasing the quantity to 10 with a lower digit like 0s is also an option if I think there are enough 0s between us. Given the history, Player 0 has been aggressive with 6s, so they might have a strong hand in 6s. I will bid 10 0s as it's a safer bet given the low likelihood of having a very high count of 0s across both hands, and it's a significant jump from the current bid.\", \"action\": \"BID: 10 0s\"}",
