The count of each digit in my hand is: 9(1), 4(1), 8(1), 7(1), 3(1), 2(1), 1(1), 5(1). I have a total of 8 digits. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the most frequent digit in my hand. Since all digits appear once, I can choose any digit. I'll bid on '1' as it's a relatively low digit and I have one '1'. The quantity is 1. So, a valid bid is '1 D'. However, the task requires the bid to be in the format 'BID: Q D', where 'Q' is the quantity and 'D' is the digit. Thus, my bid will be 'BID: 1 1'.\", \"action\": \"BID: 1 1\"}",
