        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, my hand is 28330749. Let me break that down: the digits are 2, 8, 3, 3, 0, 7, 4, 9. So I have two 3s in my hand, and the rest are unique digits. \n\nThe current bid is 2 5s, made by Player 1. The bid history shows that Player 0 (me) first bid 2 3s, and then Player 1 went up to 2 5s. Now it's my turn again.\n\nI need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid. Let's think about the rules. A higher bid can be either a higher quantity or the same quantity but a higher digit. So from 2 5s, I could bid 3 5s or 2 6s or higher.\n\nBut before I decide, I should consider the likelihood of the current bid being true. The current bid is 2 5s. The total number of 5s in both hands could be anywhere from 0 to 16. But since Player 1 is bidding 2 5s, they might have some 5s in their hand.\n\nLooking at my hand, I don't have any 5s. So if Player 1 has, say, two 5s, that would make the total 2. But if they have more, the total could be higher. However, with only 8 digits each, the maximum number of 5s they could have is 8, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, but considering the previous bid was 2 3s, which I made. Player 1 then increased the digit to 5s, same quantity. So maybe they have some 5s, but I don't have any, so the total would depend on their hand.\n\nBut I have two 3s. If I bid 3 3s, that would be a higher quantity than 2 5s, because 3 is higher than 2, regardless of the digit. That seems like a good move because I know I have two 3s, so if the total is at least 3, I can be confident. But wait, the current bid is 2 5s, so I need to make a bid that's higher. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 6s, which is a higher digit than 5, but same quantity. Or I could go to 3 5s. \n\nBut let's think about what's more likely. If I bid 3 3s, I have two in my hand, so I'm assuming Player 1 has at least one 3. But I don't know their hand. If they don't have any 3s, then the total would be 2, which is less than my bid of 3, so I would lose if challenged. \n\nOn the other hand, if I bid 2 6s, that's a higher digit than 5, so it's a valid bid. But I don't have any 6s in my hand, so the total could be anywhere from 0 to however many they have. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider challenging. The current bid is 2 5s. If I challenge, we'll reveal the total number of 5s. If it's less than 2, I win. If it's 2 or more, Player 1 wins. \n\nBut I don't have any 5s, so the total would depend on Player 1's hand. If they have two 5s, the bid is correct. If they have one or none, the bid is wrong. \n\nBut why would Player 1 bid 2 5s? Maybe they have one 5 and think I don't have any, so the total is 1, making their bid of 2 incorrect. Or maybe they have two 5s. \n\nI'm not sure. Maybe it's safer to make a bid based on my hand. I have two 3s, so I could bid 3 3s. That way, I'm increasing the quantity, which is a higher bid. \n\nBut wait, the current bid is 2 5s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. So 3 5s would be higher in quantity, or 2 6s would be higher in digit. \n\nI think bidding 3 3s is better because I have two in my hand, so I'm more likely to be correct if the total is at least 3. But I'm not certain because I don't know Player 1's hand. \n\nAlternatively, if I challenge, and if the total number of 5s is less than 2, I win. But if it's 2 or more, I lose. \n\nI'm torn between challenging and making a bid. Let me think about the probabilities. Since I don't have any 5s, the total is determined by Player 1's hand. They have 8 digits, so the chance that they have at least two 5s is possible but not certain. \n\nIf I challenge, there's a risk, but also a chance to win. If I make a bid, I have to be confident that the total meets or exceeds my bid. \n\nGiven that I have two 3s, maybe I should bid 3 3s. That way, if Player 1 has at least one 3, the total would be 3, making my bid correct. But if they don't have any, then the total is 2, and my bid is wrong. \n\nHmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider the likelihood. Since I have two 3s, it's possible that Player 1 has at least one, but it's not guaranteed. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 6s, which is a higher digit than 5, but I don't have any 6s, so it's a risk. \n\nWait, maybe I should challenge. If I challenge, and the total is less than 2, I win. If it's 2 or more, I lose. \n\nBut I don't know Player 1's hand. They could have two 5s, making the bid correct. \n\nI think I'll go with challenging because the current bid is 2 5s, and I don't have any 5s, so the total could be low. It's a gamble, but sometimes necessary in the game.\n"
