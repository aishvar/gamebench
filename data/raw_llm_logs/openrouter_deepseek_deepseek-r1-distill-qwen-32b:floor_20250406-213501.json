        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, I have the hand: 49185897. Let me count the digits to see what I have. Breaking it down:\n\n- 4 appears once.\n- 9 appears three times (positions 2, 7, 8).\n- 1 appears once.\n- 8 appears twice (positions 4 and 6).\n- 5 appears once.\n\nSo, my hand has three 9s, two 8s, and one each of 4, 1, and 5.\n\nThe current bid is None, which means it's the first move. Since there are no previous bids, I can start with any bid. My goal is to make a bid that's likely to be true but also gives me a good chance of winning if challenged.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have three 9s. Since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total possible digits in play are 16. If I bid three 9s, that's a good starting point because I have three myself. But I should consider the possibility of the other player having some 9s as well.\n\nWait, but if I bid three 9s, the next player could challenge it if they think there aren't enough. Alternatively, I could bid four 9s to be more confident, but I only have three. That might be risky because if the total is exactly three, my bid would be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid a higher digit with a lower quantity. For example, if I bid four 9s, but I only have three, that's a bit of a stretch. However, since it's the first bid, maybe it's safer to go with a bid that's likely to be true.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the distribution of digits. Since I have three 9s, it's possible that the other player has none, making my bid of three 9s correct. But the other player might also have some 9s, making the total higher. If I bid three 9s, and the total is four, then my bid is still valid, but the next player could challenge if they think there are fewer.\n\nWait, but since I'm the first player, I can set the pace. Bidding three 9s seems reasonable because I have three myself, and it's a high digit, which might encourage the next player to challenge if they don't have enough.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid a lower digit with a higher quantity. For example, four 8s. I have two 8s, so if the other player has two, that makes four. But if they don't, then my bid might be wrong.\n\nHmm, considering the risk, maybe starting with three 9s is better because it's a high digit, and it's based on my own hand. It gives me a solid foundation, and if the other player doesn't have any 9s, my bid is correct. If they do, then the total could be higher, but since I'm the first to bid, it's a calculated risk.\n\nSo, I think I'll go with bidding three 9s. It's a good starting point, and it's based on my hand. Plus, it's a high digit, which might make the next player think twice before challenging unless they have evidence to the contrary.\n"
