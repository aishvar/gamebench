        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 2s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, my hand is 77525686. Let me break that down: the digits I have are two 7s, a 5, a 2, a 6, another 8, and another 6. Wait, no, let me count again. 7,7,5,2,5,6,8,6. So that's two 7s, two 5s, two 6s, and one 2 and one 8. So in total, I have 8 digits as per the rules.\n\nThe current bid is 2 2s, made by Player 0. Since it's my turn, I need to either make a higher bid or challenge. \n\nI remember the rules: a higher bid can be either a higher quantity or the same quantity but a higher digit. So, from 2 2s, I can go to 3 of any digit, or stay at 2 but choose a digit higher than 2, like 3s, 4s, etc. Alternatively, I could challenge if I think the current bid is too high.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 2s? Wait, no, I have one 2. So I only have a single 2. But the current bid is 2 2s. That means Player 0 is claiming that together, we have at least two 2s. Since I have one, Player 0 must have at least one 2 as well. But I don't know their hand.\n\nIf I challenge, the game will reveal the total number of 2s. If it's 2 or more, Player 0 wins; if it's less, I win. But I only have one 2, so the total could be one or two. If Player 0 has one, it's two total; if they have none, it's one. So challenging now is risky because there's a 50% chance I might lose.\n\nAlternatively, I can make a bid. Let's see what I can bid. I have two 5s, two 6s, and two 7s. So I can bid on any of those. Since the current bid is 2 2s, I can bid 3 of any digit, or 2 of a higher digit.\n\nIf I bid 3 of a digit, say 3 5s, that would be a valid bid because 3 > 2. Alternatively, I could bid 2 of a higher digit, like 2 3s, but I don't have any 3s. Wait, no, I can choose any digit. So maybe I can bid 2 5s, but that's the same quantity and higher digit, which is allowed.\n\nWait, but 2 5s is higher than 2 2s because 5 > 2. So that would be a valid bid. However, I have two 5s, so the total could be two or more. If I bid 2 5s, and the total is two or more, I'm safe. But if the total is exactly two, it's still a valid bid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid higher, like 3 5s. Since I have two, Player 0 would need at least one more 5 for the total to be three. If they don't have any, the bid would fail. So maybe 3 is too risky.\n\nAnother option is to bid on 6s. I have two 6s, so I could bid 2 6s, which is higher than 2 2s because 6 > 2. That seems safer because the total would be at least two, and if Player 0 has any 6s, it's even better.\n\nSimilarly, I have two 7s, so I could bid 2 7s, which is higher than 2 2s. But 7s are less common, so maybe Player 0 doesn't have any, making the total exactly two.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the safest move is to bid 2 5s or 2 6s or 2 7s. Since 5s are more common, maybe 2 5s is a good choice. Alternatively, 2 6s might be better because it's a higher digit.\n\nWait, but the current bid is 2 2s. If I bid 2 5s, that's a higher digit, so it's a valid bid. But if I bid 2 6s, that's even higher. So perhaps 2 6s is better.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 5s, but that's riskier because I only have two. If Player 0 has one, it's three, which is good, but if they have none, it's only two, which would make my bid invalid.\n\nSo, to minimize risk, I should stick to the same quantity but higher digit. Since I have two 6s, I can safely bid 2 6s because the total is at least two. If Player 0 has any 6s, it's even more.\n\nTherefore, I think the best move is to bid 2 6s. It's a higher digit than 2s, same quantity, so it's a valid bid, and I have two of them, making it likely to succeed.\n"
