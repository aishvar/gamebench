If they have three 8s, the total is at least 5. It's reasonable they have one or two. Bidding 4 8s feels risky, as it requires my opponent to have at least two 8s, and it's possible they only have one. However, bidding 3 9s is a valid and safer bid, as I have one 9 in my hand. It changes the digit being counted, which could throw my opponent off. Therefore, I will bid 3 9s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 9s\"\n}\n```",
