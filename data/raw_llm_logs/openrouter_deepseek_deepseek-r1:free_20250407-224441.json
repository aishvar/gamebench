You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to make the first bid in this game of Liar's Poker. My hand is 64010368. Let me count how many of each digit I have here.\n\nLooking at my digits: 6, 4, 0, 1, 0, 3, 6, 8. So, breaking it down:\n\n- 0 appears 2 times\n- 1 appears 1\n- 3 appears 1\n- 4 appears 1\n- 6 appears 2\n- 8 appears 1\n\nSo the most frequent digits in my hand are 0 and 6, each with two. Since the current bid is None, I can start with any valid bid. The first bid has to be something that's possible, but also sets a baseline. Since there are 16 total digits (8 per player), the maximum possible for any digit is 16, but realistically, it's better to start with a lower bid based on my own hand.\n\nIf I bid on 0s, I have two, and the opponent could have more. But since it's the first bid, I don't want to overcommit. Maybe start with a bid that's low but based on my own count. For example, if I bid 2 0s, that's safe because I have two, and the opponent might have at least one. But wait, the bid has to be strictly higher than the current bid, which is None. Wait, no\u2014since there's no current bid, the first bid can be any valid quantity and digit. The rules say \"Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" Wait, but 'None' is the starting point. How does that work? Oh, maybe the first bid can be any valid bid because there's nothing to compare. Wait, the initial bid has to be higher than 'None', but since 'None' is considered the lowest possible, the first player can bid anything. So the first bid can be any quantity and digit, as long as it's a valid bid (quantity between 1-16, digit 0-9). So I can start with, say, 2 0s, which is the count in my hand. But maybe starting a bit higher to set the tone. Alternatively, since the opponent has 8 digits, maybe they have some 0s as well. If I have two, maybe the total is 3 or 4. But I need to make a bid that's possible. Let's think: the minimum possible is 2 (my count) and maximum possible is 2 + 8 (if the opponent has all 0s, which is unlikely). So a bid of 3 0s would be a reasonable starting point. Alternatively, since 0 is a common digit, maybe starting with 4 0s is too aggressive. Alternatively, maybe pick a higher digit that I have, like 6. I have two 6s. If I bid 3 6s, that's possible if the opponent has at least one. But is that a good move? The opponent might challenge if they have none. Alternatively, starting with a lower quantity but higher digit. For example, 2 6s. But since I have two, that's safe. Wait, but the first bid can be any, so maybe start with a bid that's based on my own hand but leaves room for the opponent to have some. For example, if I have two 0s, bid 3 0s. That way, even if the opponent has one, the total is 3, which meets the bid. If they have two, it's 4, which is over. But if they have none, then the total is 2, which is under, and I lose if challenged. But since it's the first bid, the opponent might not challenge immediately unless they have a strong reason. Alternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity but higher digit. For example, 2 8s. I have one 8. If I bid 2 8s, the opponent needs to have at least one. If they have none, the total is 1, which is under, so they might challenge. But if they have one, it's 2, which meets the bid. So that's risky. Alternatively, maybe go for a middle digit. Let's see, in my hand, 0 and 6 are the most. So maybe bid 3 0s. That's a quantity of 3, which is higher than my own 2, but possible. Alternatively, maybe start with 2 0s. Wait, but the first bid can be any, so 2 0s is valid. But if I bid 2 0s, the opponent can challenge, and if the total is exactly 2, then I win. But if the opponent has none, then the total is 2, which meets the bid, so I win. Wait, no: if the bid is 2 0s, and the actual count is 2, then the bid is correct, so the bidder (me) wins. So if I bid 2 0s, and the opponent challenges, and the total is 2, I win. So that's safe. But maybe the opponent has more. So starting with 2 0s is a safe bid. Alternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, 2 6s. Since I have two, and the opponent might have one or two. But if I bid 2 6s, and the opponent has none, the total is 2, which meets the bid. So even if they challenge, I win. So that's safe. So either 2 0s or 2 6s would be safe. But which is better? Maybe the higher digit. Because if I bid 2 6s, the next player has to either bid higher quantity (3 of any digit) or same quantity but higher digit (like 2 7s, 8s, 9s). So if I bid 2 6s, the next player could bid 2 7s, which is higher digit. But if I bid 2 0s, the next player can bid 2 1s, 2 2s, etc., up to 2 9s. So maybe starting with a higher digit makes it harder for the opponent to bid higher without increasing the quantity. For example, if I bid 2 6s, the opponent can bid 2 7s, 2 8s, etc., but if I bid 2 0s, they can bid 2 1s, which is easy. Alternatively, maybe starting with a higher quantity. For example, 3 0s. If I bid 3 0s, then the opponent has to bid higher. If they have, say, one 0, then the total is 3, which meets the bid. But if they have none, the total is 2, which is under. So if they challenge, I lose. But as the first bid, maybe 3 0s is a bit risky. Alternatively, maybe start with 2 0s, which is safe. Let me think again. My hand has two 0s and two 6s. If I bid 2 0s, the opponent can challenge. If they have zero 0s, total is 2, which meets the bid, so I win. If they have one, total is 3. So regardless, the bid is safe. So 2 0s is a safe opening. Alternatively, 2 6s is also safe. Which one is better? Maybe the higher digit. Because if I bid 2 6s, the next player might have to bid higher, but if they have a higher digit, they can bid 2 7s, etc. Alternatively, if I bid 2 0s, they can bid 2 1s, which is easy. So maybe starting with a higher digit is better. Let's go with 2 6s. That way, the opponent has to either bid higher quantity or a higher digit. But since I have two 6s, and the opponent might have some, it's possible. Alternatively, maybe 2 0s is better because 0 is a more common digit. Wait, but in my hand, 0 and 6 are both two. Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to start with a bid that's based on the highest count in my hand. Since 0 and 6 are both two, but 6 is a higher digit. So bid 2 6s. That way, the next player has to bid higher. Alternatively, maybe start with 3 0s. But that's a higher quantity. Let me check the rules again. The first bid can be any valid bid. So 3 0s is allowed. But if I bid 3 0s, and the opponent has, say, one 0, total is 3, which is correct. If they have none, total is 2, which is under, so if they challenge, I lose. But as the first bid, maybe it's better to be conservative. So 2 0s or 2 6s. Let's say I choose 2 6s. That's a safe bid because even if the opponent has none, the total is 2 (my two 6s), which meets the bid. So if they challenge, I win. So that's a safe opening. Alternatively, if I bid 2 0s, same logic. But 0 is a lower digit. So maybe starting with a higher digit is better. So I'll go with 2 6s. That's my action.\n"
