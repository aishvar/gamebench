The current bid is 2 2s, which implies there are at least two 2s across both hands. Since I only have one '2', the opponent would need to have at least one '2' to make the bid valid. This is plausible, so challenging now is risky. The next valid bid must be either 3 of any digit, or 2 of a higher digit (3 or above). Looking at my hand, I have two '1's, two '6's, and one '5', '3', and '9'. Since I have two '1's, I can safely raise to 3 1s, assuming the opponent has at least one '1', which is reasonable. This is a safer incremental bid than raising the digit.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 1s\"\n}",
