        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 4s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since I need to bid higher, I should consider what's reasonable given my hand and the fact that the maximum quantity for any digit is 16. Bidding on a digit I have more of, like 7, could be strategic, but since I only have two 7s, bidding higher on 7s directly might not be the best approach without knowing more about the other player's hand. Considering the bid history, the jump from '2 7s' to '3 4s' indicates Player 1 might have a strong hand in 4s, but without more information, challenging seems risky. Given my hand and the need to increase the bid, I could try to bid on a digit that is higher than 4 and for which I have some presence, but since I don't have any 5s or higher in significant quantities, my best bet is to either challenge the current bid if I think it's unlikely or find a safe increase. Since challenging seems risky without a strong basis, and I don't have enough of any single digit to confidently increase the quantity significantly, I must think about the probability of the current bid being true. Given that I have no 4s, if I had to challenge or bid, I would lean towards bidding on a digit that could potentially be higher and is not overly represented in my hand, to avoid giving away my hand's composition. However, since I must increase the bid and challenging is an option, I need to weigh the likelihood of '3 4s' being true against making a potentially risky bid. Considering all, making a bid that increases the quantity or digit seems necessary, but given my hand's composition, I should consider if '3 4s' is plausible and decide based on that.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 5s\"\n}",
