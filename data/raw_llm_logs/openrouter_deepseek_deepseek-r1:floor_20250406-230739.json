You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I'm Player 0, and my hand is 72449260. So my digits are 7, 2, 4, 4, 9, 2, 6, 0. Let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\nLooking at my hand:\n- 7: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 4: 2\n- 9: 1\n- 6: 1\n- 0: 1\n\nSo, the digits 2 and 4 each have two in my hand. The rest are single. Since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total digits in play are 16. The current bid is None, so I need to make the first bid. \n\nThe goal is to start with a bid that's not too high but gives me some flexibility. Since I have two 2s and two 4s, maybe I can start with one of those. But the first bid can be low. Let's think about possible digits. The highest count in my hand is two for 2 and 4.\n\nIf I bid on 2s, maybe start with 3 2s. That would mean I have two, and the opponent might have at least one. But maybe that's a bit risky. Alternatively, since 4 is a higher digit, if I bid on 4s. For example, 3 4s. But same logic. Alternatively, since 0 is a low digit, but I have one. Maybe the opponent has some. But starting with a lower digit might be better. Wait, but the bid can be any digit. Since the first bid is None, I can choose any quantity and digit, as long as it's a valid starting bid. Wait, the rules say the first bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'. So how does that work? Since there's no previous bid, any bid is allowed. Wait, the rules say \"Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" But how is that possible? Because 'None' is not a bid. Oh, maybe the first player can bid any valid quantity and digit. Because there's no current bid to compare. Wait, the instruction says: \"Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. But maybe when the current bid is None, any bid is acceptable as the first move. Because there's nothing to compare. So the first player can start with any bid. For example, 1 0s. Or 8 9s. But since the maximum possible is 16, but that's unlikely. \n\nBut as a first bid, I should start with something reasonable based on my hand. Since I have two 2s and two 4s, maybe I can bid 3 of either. Let's say 3 2s. That way, even if the opponent has one 2, the total is 3, which meets the bid. But if they have none, then it's 2, which is less than 3. So it's a bit risky. Alternatively, since I have two 4s, maybe bid 3 4s. But same logic. Alternatively, look for the digit that I have the most of. Since I have two 2s and two 4s. Maybe start with the higher digit. 4 is higher than 2, so if I bid 3 4s, that's a higher digit than 2. Wait, but the first bid isn't compared to any previous. So maybe it's better to start with a lower quantity but higher digit. But since the first bid is free, perhaps starting with a moderate bid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity. Like 2 of a higher digit. For example, 2 7s, but I have one 7. If I bid 2 7s, that's possible. The opponent could have one. But since I have one, if they have one, total is two. Which meets the bid. But if they have none, then it's one. So that's risky. Alternatively, bid 2 9s. I have one 9. If the opponent has one, total is two. So that's safe. But if they have none, then it's one. So again, 50-50. \n\nAlternatively, since I have two 4s, maybe bid 2 4s. That's safe because I already have two, so even if the opponent has none, the total is two. So the bid is 2 4s. But then the next player has to bid higher. They can bid 3 of any digit, or 2 of a higher digit. For example, 2 5s. So starting with 2 4s gives them flexibility. Alternatively, bid 3 2s. If I bid 3 2s, and I have two, the opponent needs to have at least one. If they don't, then the bid is wrong. But as the first bid, maybe it's better to start with a safer bid. \n\nWait, but in the example given, the first bid was 3 5s. So maybe starting with a bid of 3 of a digit that you have two of. So like 3 2s. Because I have two, and if the opponent has one, that's three. But if they have none, then it's two. But since the first bid is the opening, perhaps it's better to start with a bid that's possible. Maybe 3 2s is better because even if the opponent has one, it's valid. But there's a risk. Alternatively, start with a lower quantity but higher digit. For example, 2 5s. But I don't have any 5s. That's risky. \n\nAlternatively, since I have two 4s, maybe bid 3 4s. If the opponent has one, then total is three. If not, then two. So 50-50. But maybe that's too aggressive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a bid of 2 4s. That's safe because I have two. So even if the opponent has none, the total is two. But wait, the bid is 2 4s, which is exactly what I have. Then the opponent can challenge. If they challenge, the total is two, which meets the bid. So I win. So maybe that's a safe opening. Wait, but if I bid 2 4s, and the opponent challenges, then the total is two (since I have two). So the bid is correct, so I win. Therefore, bidding 2 4s is a safe opening because even if challenged, I can't lose. Because I have two, and the bid is two. But wait, the bid requires that the total is at least the quantity. So 2 4s would require that there are at least two 4s. Since I have two, even if the opponent has none, the total is two, which meets the bid. Therefore, if I bid 2 4s, and the opponent challenges, I win. That's a safe opening. So maybe that's the best move. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 3 4s, and I have two, then the opponent needs to have at least one. But if they have none, then the total is two, which is less than three. So if they challenge, I lose. But as the first bid, perhaps it's better to start with a safe bid. So 2 4s is safe. Then the opponent has to either bid higher (like 3 of something or 2 of a higher digit) or challenge. But since the bid is exactly two, and I have two, challenging would make them lose. So they would have to bid higher. So starting with 2 4s is a safe opening. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid on a higher digit. For example, 2 9s. I have one 9. So if I bid 2 9s, the opponent needs to have at least one. If they have one, then total is two. If not, it's one. But that's a 50-50. But since I have one, maybe that's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 0s. I have one 0. So if the opponent has one, then total is two. If not, it's one. So again, 50-50. \n\nBut the safest bid is 2 4s because I have two. That way, even if the opponent challenges, I win. So that's a guaranteed safe bid. Therefore, the best action is to bid 2 4s.\n"
