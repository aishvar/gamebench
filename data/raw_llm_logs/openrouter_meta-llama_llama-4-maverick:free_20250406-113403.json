        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 4 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '1 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 32 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.",

                    "content": "To make a decision, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Your Hand**: 55155882\n   - Analyzing your hand: You have 2 '5's.\n\n2. **Current Bid**: 1 5s\n   - The current bid is on '5's with a quantity of 1.\n\n3. **Your Turn**: It's your turn as Player 1.\n\nGiven that the current bid is '1 5s', to make a higher bid, you need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit.\n\nSince you have 2 '5's in your hand, you know that the total count of '5's across all players is at least 2 (the 2 '5's you have) plus at least the one '5' that the current bid is claiming exists elsewhere. So, the total count of '5's is likely more than 1.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n- You can bid higher than '1 5s' by either bidding a higher quantity of '5's or keeping the quantity as 1 and bidding a higher digit.\n\n1. **Bidding a higher quantity of '5's**: Since you have 2 '5's and the bid is for at least 1 '5', you can reasonably assume there's more than 1 '5'. You can bid '3 5s' because you know there's at least 2 '5's in your hand and the bid is for 1 '5'. So, bidding '3 5s' is a reasonable increase.\n\n2. **Bidding a higher digit with the same quantity**: You could bid '1 6s', but without information about the distribution of '6's, this is speculative.\n\nLet's examine both options:\n- **Bidding '3 5s'**: This is a relatively safe bid because it's based on the knowledge that there are at least 3 '5's (2 in your hand and at least 1 as per the current bid).\n\n- **Bidding '1 6s'**: Your hand has no '6's. This bid is speculative and assumes that at least one other player has a '6'.\n\nGiven the information and the need to make a bid that's higher than '1 5s', the most reasonable action is to increase the quantity of '5's because it's based on the information you have (your hand and the current bid).\n\nTherefore, bidding '3 5s' seems like a reasonable action. It increases the quantity, making it a valid higher bid than '1 5s'.\n\nHere's the response in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is '1 5s'. I have 2 '5's in my hand, so I know there are at least 3 '5's across all hands. Bidding '3 5s' is a reasonable increase in quantity based on this knowledge.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 5s\"\n}\n```",
