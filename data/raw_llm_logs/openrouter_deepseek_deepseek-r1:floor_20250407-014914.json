You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of 2 2s. \n\nFirst, let me check my own hand. My hand is 6,6,2,5,1,0,9,5. So I have one 2 here. That means, at least, there's my 2 plus whatever the other player has. The current bid is 2 2s. Since I have one, the opponent must have at least one more 2 to make the total 2. But the bid is exactly 2, so if they have at least one, the bid is valid.\n\nBut wait, the other player could have zero 2s. Then the total would be just my one, which is less than 2, so the bid would be invalid. But do I have a way to know? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can make a higher bid. The current bid is 2 2s. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity (like 3 of any digit) or keep the quantity at 2 and choose a higher digit than 2. For example, 2 3s or higher.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 6s, two 5s, and one each of 2,1,0,9. So if I bid 2 5s, that's same quantity but higher digit (5 > 2). That would be a valid higher bid. Alternatively, if I bid 3 of a lower digit, like 3 0s, but I only have one 0. Not sure about that. \n\nBut bidding 2 5s would be a safe move because I have two 5s. The opponent might have more, so the total could be higher. But even if they don't, the bid is 2 5s, which I can support with my own. So the total would be at least 2. If I bid that, and the opponent challenges, then if they have any 5s, it's valid. If not, then it's exactly 2. Wait, but my bid is 2 5s, so if the total is exactly 2, it's valid. Since I have two, even if they have none, the total is 2. So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have more 5s. So bidding 2 5s seems better than challenging. Because challenging the current bid of 2 2s might be risky. If the opponent has at least one 2, then the bid is valid and I lose. But if they have none, then challenging would make me win. But how likely is that?\n\nI have one 2. The opponent has 8 digits. The chance they have at least one 2? There are 9 other digits (since total digits are 0-9, but each has 8 cards). Wait, no, actually, in Liar's Poker, each player has 8 digits, but the digits are from 0-9, so each digit can appear multiple times. So the opponent's hand is 8 digits, which could include 0-9. The total number of possible digits they could have is 10, but with 8 cards. The probability that they have at least one 2 is... I'm not sure, but maybe it's better to avoid challenging if I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, since the current bid is 2 2s, and I have one, the opponent needs at least one more. If they have none, then the total is 1, so the bid is invalid. But if they have even one, then the total is 2, which meets the bid. So challenging is risky because there's a chance they have one or more. \n\nSo maybe it's safer to make a higher bid. Bidding 2 5s would be a higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). Since I have two 5s, even if the opponent has none, the total is 2, which meets the bid. So that's a safe move. If I bid 2 5s, and the opponent challenges, I know that at least I have two, so the total is at least two. Therefore, the bid is valid, and I win. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 of a lower digit, but I don't have enough in my hand. For example, 3 6s. I have two 6s. If I bid 3 6s, then the opponent would need to have at least one more 6. But I can't be sure. So that's riskier. \n\nSo the safest bid is 2 5s. It's a higher digit than 2, same quantity, which makes it a valid higher bid. And since I have two 5s, even if the opponent has none, the total is two, which meets the bid. So that's a solid move.\n"
