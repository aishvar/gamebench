Since the total number of digits is 16 and the bid is only 1, it's very likely that Player 0 has at least one '3' in their hand, making the current bid quite plausible. Therefore, challenging now is risky. A safe approach is to increase the bid. The minimal valid raise would be either to 2 '3's or 1 of a higher digit (since digit increases take precedence after quantity ties). Given that I have three '6's in my hand, bidding 2 '6's is safer because I already hold the majority of that count. So, I will bid 2 '6's.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 6\"\n}",
