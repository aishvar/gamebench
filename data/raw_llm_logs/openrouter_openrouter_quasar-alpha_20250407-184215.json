Since I only have one, my opponent would need to have at least three '2's for the bid to be valid. Given that each player has 8 digits, the probability of one player holding three or more '2's is relatively low. The prior bids show Player 1 increasing the count on 2s from 3 to 4, which may be a bluff to pressure me. Based on my hand and the statistical unlikelihood, I believe the bid is likely invalid.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
