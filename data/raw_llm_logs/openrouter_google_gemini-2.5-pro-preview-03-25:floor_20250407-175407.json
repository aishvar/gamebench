For this bid to be accurate, there must be a total of at least four '8's across both hands (16 digits total). Since I only hold one '8', Player 1 must hold at least three '8's in their 8-digit hand. While Player 1 has bid '8's twice (3 8s and 4 8s), suggesting they may hold some '8's, needing three specific digits out of eight is statistically less likely (expected number is 0.8). My alternative is to bid higher, such as '5 4s' or '5 5s' (as I hold two of each). However, Player 1 bypassed opportunities to challenge or bid on '4's or '5's when I bid them previously, instead pushing '8's. This could imply they don't hold many '4's or '5's, making a bid of 5 on those digits risky. Given the statistical unlikelihood of Player 1 holding three '8's and the risk associated with bidding higher on digits they avoided, challenging the '4 8s' bid appears to be the most strategically sound move.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
