For the bid to be true, Player 1 needs to hold at least two 8s out of their eight digits. This is plausible but not certain. Challenging is an option. Alternatively, I can make a higher bid. My hand contains two 4s and two 5s. My previous bid was 3 4s, which Player 1 did not challenge but instead bid 3 8s. This might suggest Player 1 is not strong in 4s. Bidding based on my two 5s seems like a strong alternative. A bid of 4 5s is higher than 3 8s (quantity increases from 3 to 4). This bid requires Player 1 to hold at least two 5s. Given I hold two 5s, this feels like a reasonable escalation that leverages my hand's strength and puts pressure back on Player 1, forcing them to decide whether to challenge or bid even higher.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 5s\"\n}\n```",
