The current bid is 5 of the digit 1. I will count the number of 1s in my hand: I have 1 '1' in my hand (52667167). The maximum possible quantity for any digit across both hands is 16. Given that I only have 1 '1', bidding a higher quantity of '1's is not possible for me. However, I can bid on a different digit. Counting my digits: I have 1 '0', 0 '1's, 1 '2', 1 '3', 0 '4's, 2 '5's, 2 '6's, and 1 '7'. Since the current bid is on '1's and I only have 1 '1', I should consider bidding on a digit that I have a higher count of. I have 2 '5's, 2 '6's, and 1 '7', and 1 '0', 1 '2', 1 '3' and 1 '7'. I can bid on '5's or '6's as they are higher than '1'. I choose to bid on '5's because I have 2 of them, which is a higher quantity than '1's. Thus, I will bid '6 5s' as it's higher than '5 1s'.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 6 5s\"\n}\n```",
