Since I hold two 7s, the opponent would only need to have at least one 7 to make the bid plausible. Given the distribution, it's reasonably likely they have at least one 7 among their eight digits, making the current bid believable. Raising to 4 7s would require the opponent to have at least two 7s, which is less probable. Instead, making a minimal safe raise by increasing the digit to a lower frequency digit with the same count (3 8s or 3 9s) is risky without evidence. A safer option is to increase the quantity but switch to a digit I have more of. My hand contains one 5, one 2, one 3, two 7s, one 4, and one 1, so the best minimal raise is to 4 of a digit I have at least one of. The safest minimal legal raise is '4 7s', but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, I can bid '3 8s' or '3 9s', but this is less safe. Given that, challenging the current bid is risky because it's plausible. Therefore, the strategic move is to raise to '4 7s'.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 7\"\n}",
