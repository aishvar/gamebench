        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at my hand: 6, 2, 6, 5, 3, 2, 6, 7. So, the digits I have are: 6 appears three times, 2 appears twice, and then 5, 3, and 7 once each. That's helpful because I know how many of each digit I have.\n\nThe current bid is 4 8s made by Player 1. My previous bid was 3 6s, so the game is moving forward. Now, I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid.\n\nSince the current bid is 4 8s, I have to consider the likelihood that there are at least four 8s in both players' hands combined. My hand doesn't have any 8s, so all the 8s must be in Player 1's hand. But wait, Player 1 only has eight digits, just like me. So, to have four 8s, Player 1 would need to have four of their eight digits as 8s. That's a significant portion of their hand.\n\nI should think about the probability of that happening. If each digit is equally likely, the chance of having four 8s in eight digits is quite low. It's possible, but not very probable. Especially since, in my hand, I don't have any 8s, which might indicate that there aren't many 8s in the game.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the previous bid. I had bid 3 6s, which is a lower bid. If Player 1 is bidding 4 8s, they might be trying to escalate the bid to make it harder for me to continue. But given that I don't have any 8s, challenging might be a good move because it's risky for Player 1 to have four 8s.\n\nI also need to think about the maximum possible quantity. Since there are 16 digits in total, four 8s is a quarter of all digits. That's a high number, especially if I don't see any 8s in my hand. It makes me doubt the validity of their bid.\n\nSo, putting it all together, challenging the bid seems like the best move. The likelihood of there being four 8s is low, especially considering my hand has none. If I challenge and win, I can gain an advantage. If not, well, that's the risk of the game.\n\nI don't think bidding higher is a good idea here because I don't have enough information about the other digits. Challenging is a strategic move that could turn the game in my favor.\n"
