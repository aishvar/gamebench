Given that each player has 8 digits, the probability of Player 0 having at least one 7 is reasonably high, making the current bid plausible. Challenging now might be risky. Therefore, the strategic move is to increase the bid. I can either increase the quantity to 4 7s or bid at least 3 of a higher digit. Since 7 is already a high digit and I hold two of them, increasing the quantity to 4 7s would be aggressive but plausible. Alternatively, I can bid 3 8s or 3 9s if I have confidence in those digits. I have one 9 and no 8s, so raising to 3 9s is riskier. The safer option is to bid 4 7s, leveraging my strong holding of 7s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 7s\"\n}",
