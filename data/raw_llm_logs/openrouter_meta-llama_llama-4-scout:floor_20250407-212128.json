My hand does not have a high count of '9s', so bidding higher on '9s' seems risky. However, I can try to bid on a different digit. I have 2 '6s', 2 '4s', and other digits appear once or not at all. A safe bet would be to bid on a digit that I know appears multiple times in my hand. Since I have 2 '6s' and no information about Player 0's '6s', I can bid on '6s'.
