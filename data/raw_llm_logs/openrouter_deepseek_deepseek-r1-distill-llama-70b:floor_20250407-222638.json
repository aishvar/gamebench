You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn to make a bid. The current bid is none, which means I get to start. My hand is 72936485. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze my hand. The digits I have are 7, 2, 9, 3, 6, 4, 8, and 5. So, each digit appears once except for any duplicates. Wait, looking at the numbers: 7,2,9,3,6,4,8,5. Each is unique. So, I don't have any duplicates in my hand. That means for each digit, I have exactly one.\n\nSince the current bid is none, I can choose any digit and any quantity. But I have to consider that the other player also has 8 digits. So, the total number of any digit can't exceed 16 (8 from each player). But since I have only one of each digit, the maximum any digit could be is 9 (if the other player has 8 of that digit, but that's impossible because each digit in their hand is unique as well, right? Wait, no, the other player's digits are secret, so they could have duplicates. Hmm, but in Liar's Poker, each player has 8 secret digits, but they can have duplicates. So, the other player could have multiple copies of a digit, which would increase the total count.\n\nBut since I have one of each digit, I can only influence the count by that one. So, for example, if I bid on 7s, the total could be 1 (mine) plus whatever the other player has. But since I don't know their digits, I have to make an educated guess.\n\nSince I have one of each digit, the safest bet is to bid on a digit that's likely to have a higher count. But without knowing the opponent's hand, it's tricky. However, since I'm starting the bid, I can choose a low quantity to make it easier to be correct. For example, bidding 2 of a digit. But wait, I only have one, so the opponent would need to have at least one as well to make the total 2. Alternatively, I can bid 1 of a digit, which is guaranteed to be true since I have at least one.\n\nWait, but the rules say that a bid must be a quantity and a digit. The minimum quantity is 1, I think. So, I can bid 1 of any digit I have. Since I have one of each, any digit from 0-9 that I have in my hand can be bid as 1. But I don't have 0,1, so I can't bid on those. Wait, my hand is 7,2,9,3,6,4,8,5. So digits present are 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. I don't have 0 or 1.\n\nSo, I can bid 1 of any of these digits. But since the bid has to be strictly higher than none, which it will be, as any bid is higher than none. So, the first bid can be any quantity from 1 to 16, but realistically, since I have one, the maximum I can safely bid is 1, unless I think the opponent has more.\n\nBut to make a safe bid, I can start with 1 of a digit I have. Alternatively, I can bid higher if I think the opponent has some. But since I don't know, maybe it's better to start low.\n\nAlternatively, I can choose a higher digit with a low quantity. For example, bidding 1 9s. Since I have one 9, and the opponent could have none or some. But if I bid 1 9s, it's likely to be safe because even if the opponent has none, the total is 1, which meets the bid.\n\nBut I also have to consider that the opponent might challenge. If I bid 1 9s and they challenge, and the total is 1, I win. If the total is 0, they win. But since I have one, the total can't be 0. So, 1 9s is a safe bid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid a higher quantity on a lower digit. For example, 2 5s. Since I have one 5, the opponent would need at least one more for the total to be 2. But I don't know if they have any 5s. So, it's riskier.\n\nGiven that, maybe starting with a bid of 1 on a high digit is better because it's more likely to be accepted without a challenge. Or perhaps I can bid a higher quantity on a digit I think the opponent might have.\n\nWait, but the opponent's hand is unknown. So, the safest approach is to bid 1 on a digit I have. That way, the bid is guaranteed to be correct unless the opponent has zero of that digit, which would make the total 1 (since I have one). So, actually, if I bid 1 on any digit I have, the total will be at least 1, so the bid will always be correct. Therefore, challenging such a bid would be risky for the opponent because they would lose.\n\nSo, in this case, I can choose any digit I have and bid 1. To maximize the chance that the opponent doesn't challenge, I should choose a digit that's less likely to be in their hand. But since I don't know, it's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, I can choose a higher quantity if I think the opponent has some. For example, if I bid 2 5s, and the opponent has at least one 5, then the bid is correct. But if they have none, I lose. So, it's a gamble.\n\nGiven that, I think the safest move is to bid 1 on a high digit, like 9. So, I'll bid 1 9s. That way, I'm certain the total is at least 1, so the bid is valid. The opponent might think I'm bluffing, but since the bid is minimal, they might not challenge.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid a higher quantity on a digit I think is common. But without knowing, it's safer to go with 1.\n\nSo, my action is to bid 1 9s.\n"
