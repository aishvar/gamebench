You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. The game state shows that I'm Player 0, and the current bid is None, meaning I need to make the first bid. The players involved are me and Player 1. My hand is 49930727, which I can analyze to figure out the best move.\n\nFirst, I'll look at my hand: 4,9,9,3,0,7,2,7. Let me count the occurrences of each digit:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 2: 1\n- 3: 1\n- 4: 1\n- 7: 2\n- 9: 2\n\nSo, the digits I have are mostly low counts except for 7 and 9, each appearing twice. Since I'm the first to bid, I have to set the initial quantity and digit. The goal is to make a bid that's high enough to encourage others to either follow with a higher bid or challenge it if they think it's too high.\n\nConsidering my hand, I have two 7s and two 9s. Bidding on a digit I have more of might be safer because it gives me some confidence that the total count across both hands could be higher. Alternatively, I can choose a digit that's less likely to be in the opponent's hand, but since I don't know their hand, that's tricky.\n\nIf I bid on 7s, I have two of them. The total possible in both hands is 16 digits. So, the maximum number of 7s could be up to 16, but realistically, it's more likely to be around 0-8, depending on the opponent's hand. Bidding 3 7s would mean I'm asserting that there are at least three 7s in total. Since I have two, I'm assuming the opponent has at least one more. That seems plausible but not too high.\n\nAlternatively, if I bid on 9s, I have two, but 9s are higher digits, so if I bid 3 9s, it might be more convincing because higher digits are less common, but I'm not sure. The opponent might be more likely to challenge a high digit bid if they don't have many.\n\nAnother angle: since I'm the first bidder, I want to set a bid that's hard to beat but not impossible. Starting with a mid-range quantity and digit could be effective. For example, 3 7s is a good starting point because it's not too high, but it also shows confidence in the digit's presence.\n\nI also need to consider that the opponent might have some 7s, but without knowing their hand, it's a gamble. However, starting with 3 7s gives me a reasonable chance that the total count is at least three, especially since I have two myself. It's a balanced bid that's not too aggressive but still sets a bar for the opponent to either increase the quantity or the digit.\n\nSo, after evaluating my hand and the possible outcomes, I think bidding 3 7s is a solid move. It's based on my two 7s, and it's a reasonable assumption that the opponent might have at least one more. This bid is likely to encourage the opponent to either challenge it if they think it's too high or to make a higher bid if they have more confidence in another digit.\n"
