You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn to make a bid. The current bid is None, which means I'm the first to bid. My hand is 14371086. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze my hand. The digits I have are 1, 4, 3, 7, 1, 0, 8, 6. So, breaking that down, I have two 1s, and one each of 4, 3, 7, 0, 8, 6. That's a total of eight digits, as per the game rules.\n\nSince the current bid is None, I can choose any digit and any quantity. My goal is to make a bid that's as strong as possible without overreaching, so I don't want to bid something too high that might get challenged.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have duplicates of the digit 1. That's two 1s. So, I can confidently say that there are at least two 1s in the combined hands of both players. But wait, since each player has eight digits, the maximum possible for any digit is 16. But in reality, it's much lower because there are only 10 possible digits.\n\nI should consider which digit to choose. I have two 1s, which is a good starting point. Alternatively, I could look at other digits I have, but since 1 is the only one with duplicates, it's the safest bet.\n\nNow, the quantity. Since I have two 1s, I can bid at least two 1s. But maybe I can go higher. However, since I don't know the opponent's hand, it's safer to start with a lower bid to avoid being challenged. If I bid too high, the opponent might challenge, and I could lose if they don't have enough.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid a higher quantity on a digit I have only one of, but that's riskier because I don't know if the opponent has any. For example, if I bid 1 3s, but the opponent might have none, making the total just 1, which matches my bid, so I would win. But if I bid higher than that, like 2 3s, and the opponent has none, I lose.\n\nWait, no. The bid is about the total across both hands. So if I have one 3 and bid 1 3s, the total could be 1 or more. If I bid 1 3s, the opponent could have zero, making the total exactly 1, which meets the bid. So the bidder would win. But if I bid 2 3s and the opponent has none, the total is 1, which is less than 2, so the challenger would win.\n\nSo, for digits I have only one of, it's safer to bid 1 of that digit because the opponent could have zero, making the total exactly 1. But if I bid 2, the opponent might have zero, and I lose.\n\nBut in my case, I have two 1s. So, I can safely bid 2 1s because even if the opponent has zero 1s, the total is 2, which meets the bid. If the opponent has one or more, the total is higher, which is even better.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 1s, hoping the opponent has at least one. But that's riskier because if the opponent has none, the total is 2, which is less than 3, and a challenge would make me lose.\n\nSo, the safest bid is 2 1s. It's a low-risk move that's likely to be correct. Plus, it's a starting point that doesn't commit me to a high number, making it harder for the opponent to challenge without risking losing.\n\nI could also consider other digits, but since 1 is the only one I have duplicates of, it's the best choice. For example, I have a 0, which is rare. If I bid 1 0s, the opponent might have none, making the total 1, which is good. But 0s are less common, so maybe it's a good alternative. However, I think 1s are more likely to have at least two in total because 0s can sometimes be less frequent.\n\nWait, in poker, 0s are actually quite common in some cases, but in this context, it's just random digits. So, it's hard to say. But since I have two 1s, it's a safer bet.\n\nAnother thought: if I bid 2 1s, the opponent might have more 1s, making the total higher, which is fine. But if I bid higher, like 3 1s, and the opponent has one, the total is 3, which is good. But if the opponent has none, I lose. So, 2 is safer.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to bid 2 1s. It's a solid, safe bid that's likely to be correct, and it's a good starting point for the game.\n"
