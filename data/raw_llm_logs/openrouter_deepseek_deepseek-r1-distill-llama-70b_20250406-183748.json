        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 63885385. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze my own digits. I have the digits 6, 3, 8, 8, 5, 3, 8, 5. Let me count how many of each I have. \n\n- 6: 1\n- 3: 2\n- 8: 3\n- 5: 2\n\nSo, in my hand, the most common digit is 8, with three of them. That's a good starting point. Since the current bid is None, I can set the first bid. \n\nI remember that in Liar's Poker, the goal is to make a bid that's either a higher quantity or a higher digit than the previous bid. Since there's no previous bid, I get to choose both the quantity and the digit. \n\nGiven that I have three 8s, I can bid 3 8s. That seems like a solid starting point because it's based on my own hand. It's not too high, which might make it harder for the opponent to challenge, but it's also not too low, so I can potentially increase the bid later if needed.\n\nI should consider if there's a higher digit I can bid on, but looking at my hand, the highest digit is 8. So, bidding on 8s makes sense. If I were to bid on a higher digit, like 9, I don't have any, which could be risky if the opponent challenges. \n\nAnother thought: since I have three 8s, the total number of 8s in play could be more than three if the opponent has any. So, bidding 3 8s is a safe bet. It's also a common enough digit that the opponent might have at least one or two, making the total count meet or exceed my bid.\n\nI don't see any reason to bid higher than 3 on 8s because I don't have more in my hand, and I don't want to overcommit. Plus, making a lower bid might give the opponent an easy way to challenge, but since I have three, I think it's a good balance.\n\nSo, my plan is to bid 3 8s. It's based on my hand, it's a reasonable quantity, and it sets a foundation for the game without being too aggressive.\n"
