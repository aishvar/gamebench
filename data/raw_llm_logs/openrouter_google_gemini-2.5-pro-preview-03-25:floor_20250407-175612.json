With 16 total digits in play (2 players * 8 digits), the expected number of any specific digit is 1.6 (16 * 1/10). Having two 8s is slightly above average. A safe bid would be 'two 8s', guaranteed by my hand. However, a slightly more assertive opening bid is often strategically better. Bidding 'three 8s' requires the opponent to hold at least one 8 among their 8 digits. The probability of the opponent having at least one 8 is reasonably high (approximately 1 - (0.9)^8 \u2248 57%). This bid leverages my strong holding of 8s while being statistically plausible.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 8\"\n}\n```",
