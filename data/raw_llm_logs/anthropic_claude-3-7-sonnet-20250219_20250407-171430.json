Since I have zero 2s in my hand, this means Player 0 must have at least 2 twos in their hand for this bid to be valid. This is certainly possible - they could have more than 2 twos. I have several options: I could bid \\'2 3s\\', \\'2 4s\\', etc., or I could increase the quantity to \\'3\\' of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have one 1, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 7, one 8, and one 9. I don\\'t have any digit more than once. So if I bid on quantity 3, I\\'d need Player 0 to have at least 2 of that digit.
