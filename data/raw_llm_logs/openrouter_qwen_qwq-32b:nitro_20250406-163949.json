You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to decide whether to bid or challenge in this Liar's Poker game. The current bid is 3 0s made by Player 0. My turn is as Player 1. My hand is 86591485. Let me start by looking at my own digits. My hand has the digits 8, 6, 5, 9, 1, 4, 8, 5. Wait, so I can count how many of each digit I have here. Let me list them out:\n\nLooking at each digit in my hand:\n- 8 appears twice (positions 1 and 7)\n- 6 once\n- 5 twice (positions 3 and 8)\n- 9 once\n- 1 once\n- 4 once\n\nSo zeros in my hand: none. The current bid is 3 0s. The total number of digits between both players is 16 (since each has 8). The bid claims there are at least 3 zeros in all 16 digits. Since I have zero zeros, that means Player 0 must have at least 3 zeros in their hand to make the total 3. But each player only has 8 digits, so the maximum zeros Player 0 could have is 8, but realistically, getting 3 zeros is possible but maybe unlikely?\n\nWait, but the bid is for total across both hands. Since I have none, the other player's hand must have at least 3 zeros. Let me think: the bid is 3 0s. The total zeros in both hands must be at least 3. Since I have 0, the opponent's hand must have at least 3. But is that possible? Let's see. The opponent has 8 digits. They could have 3, 4, etc. zeros. But is 3 zeros in 8 digits plausible? It's possible, but maybe not too common. Alternatively, maybe I can bid higher. The next possible bid would need to be higher than 3 0s. To increase the bid, I can either go to 4 of any digit, or same quantity (3) but a higher digit than 0. Since 0 is the lowest digit, the next digit would be 1. So a bid of 3 1s would be higher. But maybe that's risky. Alternatively, maybe I can bid a higher quantity. Let me see what my options are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe challenging is better here. Let's think: if I challenge the bid of 3 0s, then we check the total zeros. Since I have none, if the opponent has less than 3, then I win. But if they have 3 or more, I lose. The question is: how likely is it that Player 0 has 3 or more zeros? \n\nAssuming that the opponent's hand is random (though in real play, maybe they have some strategy), but since we don't know, we have to make a probabilistic guess. The chance that their 8 digits have at least 3 zeros. Let's estimate: the probability of a single digit being zero is 1/10 (assuming digits are 0-9 equally likely). Wait, but actually in real life, each digit is equally likely, but in Liar's Poker, each digit is equally probable. So the expected number of zeros in 8 digits would be 0.8 (since 8 * 0.1). So getting 3 zeros is possible but not too high. The probability of exactly 3 zeros is C(8,3)*(0.1)^3*(0.9)^5 \u2248 56 * 0.001 * 0.328 \u2248 ~0.018. The probability of 3 or more would be sum from 3 to 8 of C(8,k)*(0.1)^k*(0.9)^(8-k). Let me compute that roughly:\n\nP(3) \u2248 0.018\nP(4) = C(8,4)*(0.1)^4*(0.9)^4 \u2248 70 * 0.0001 * 0.656 \u2248 ~0.0046\nP(5) even smaller. So total is maybe around 0.022 or so. So about 2% chance. That's low. So challenging might be a good idea here because the chance that the total zeros are >=3 is low. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is bluffing. So challenging would be better. Alternatively, if I bid higher, but what's the next possible bid? To bid higher than 3 0s, I could go to 4 of any digit, or 3 of a higher digit (like 3 1s, 3 2s, etc). But if I bid 3 1s, that's a valid higher bid. But I need to consider if that's a good idea. Alternatively, maybe I can bid a higher digit with a lower quantity but same or higher. Wait, the rules say the bid must be strictly higher. To beat 3 0s, I can either increase the quantity (to 4 or more of any digit) or keep the same quantity but choose a higher digit (since 0 is the lowest, so 3 1s would be higher than 3 0s). \n\nBut if I bid 3 1s, then I'm claiming there are at least 3 1s in total. Since I have one 1 in my hand, the opponent would need to have at least 2 more. But maybe that's plausible. Alternatively, maybe I can choose a digit I have more of. Let's see my digits again. My hand has two 8s, two 5s, etc. So if I bid 3 5s, that would require at least 3 fives total. I have two, so opponent needs at least 1. That might be better. But is that a good move? Alternatively, maybe I can go higher in quantity. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to challenge, since the current bid is 3 0s, and I have zero, so the opponent must have at least 3. Since the probability of that is low, challenging might be better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the opponent is more likely to have 3 zeros? Maybe not. Let's think again: in 8 random digits, the chance of 3 zeros is low, so challenging could be better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent has some zeros, but maybe not 3. So challenging might be the better play here. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid higher, like 3 1s. Since I have one 1, maybe the opponent has none, but that's a risk. Alternatively, maybe I should bid 4 5s? Wait, I have two 5s. So total would need 4. That might be a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can bid 4 8s. I have two 8s, so if I bid 4, that's a bid that's higher than 3 0s. But the actual count would be my two plus whatever the opponent has. If they have none, then 2 <4, so if I bid 4 8s and they have none, then if challenged, I lose. But maybe I can bluff.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to challenge. Since the current bid is 3 0s, and I have none, the opponent's hand needs at least 3 zeros. The probability is low, so challenging gives me a high chance to win. So perhaps challenging is better here.\n\nTherefore, I think the best move is to challenge the bid, since the likelihood of there being three zeros is low. Hence, the action should be CHALLENGE.\n"
