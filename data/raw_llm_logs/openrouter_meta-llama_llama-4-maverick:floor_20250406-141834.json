        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 4 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '5 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 32 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

The total number of 8s across all hands must be at least 5 for the current bid to be valid. Since there are 8 players and each has 8 digits, there are a total of 32 digits. Bidding 5 8s suggests that the bidder believes there are at least 5 eights. I have one 8 in my hand. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Increasing the quantity to 6 with digit 8 is a valid bid (6 8s). However, I should consider if it's likely that there are at least 6 eights. Alternatively, I can bid the same quantity (5) with a higher digit, which would be 5 9s. My hand has one 9, so it's plausible there are others. Bidding 5 9s seems like a reasonable action as it is a higher bid and utilizes the information that I have a 9.\", \"action\": \"BID: 5 9s\"}",
