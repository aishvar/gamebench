You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, let me try to figure out the best move here. So, I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. The current bid is 3 9s made by Player 1. I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the last bid.\n\nFirst, let me look at my hand: 85919273. Let me count how many 9s I have here. Okay, looking at each digit: 8,5,9,1,9,2,7,3. So, I have two 9s in my hand. That's good to know because it gives me some information about the total count.\n\nThe current bid is 3 9s. Since I have two 9s, I know that the total number of 9s can't be less than two. But the bid is three, so the other player must have at least one 9 or maybe more. But wait, the maximum possible is 16 digits, but each player has 8, so the total for any digit can't exceed 16. \n\nNow, I need to think about whether to bid higher or challenge. Bidding higher would require me to either increase the quantity or the digit. If I increase the quantity, the next possible bid would be 4 9s. Alternatively, I could keep the quantity the same and choose a higher digit, like 3 9s to 3 9s isn't higher, so I need to go to 3 9s -> 3 9s isn't higher, so I need to go higher in digit, but digits go from 0-9, so after 9 is nothing. So, the only way is to increase the quantity.\n\nBut wait, if I bid 4 9s, I have to consider the likelihood. I have two 9s, so if the other player has one, that makes three. If I bid four, I'm saying there are at least four 9s in total. But I only have two, so the other player would need to have two more. That seems a bit risky because I don't know their hand. \n\nAlternatively, if I challenge, I'm betting that the total number of 9s is less than three. But I have two in my hand, so the other player would need to have zero or one. If they have one, the total is three, which matches the bid, so I would lose the challenge. If they have zero, the total is two, and the bid was three, so I would win. But I don't know their hand, so there's a chance.\n\nConsidering the risk, maybe challenging is better because if the other player has only one 9, the bid is exactly three, which is valid. But if they have zero, I win. However, I have two 9s, so the other player could have one or two. If they have two, the total is four, which would make my challenge lose. But I don't know.\n\nWait, the current bid is 3 9s. If I challenge, and the total is exactly three, the bid is correct, so I lose. If it's less, I win. But I have two, so the other player could have one, making it three, or zero, making it two. So, there's a 50-50 chance, maybe.\n\nBut considering that the other player bid 3 9s, they might have more confidence in it. Maybe they have two 9s as well, making the total four. If that's the case, challenging would be a bad move because the total would be four, which is higher than three, so I lose.\n\nAlternatively, if I bid 4 9s, I'm taking a risk that the total is at least four. If the other player has two 9s, then total is four, so my bid is correct. If they have one, total is three, so my bid is wrong, and I lose. If they have none, total is two, so my bid is wrong.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should consider the likelihood. Since I have two 9s, the other player could have one or two. If they have one, total is three, so the current bid is correct. If they have two, total is four. So, if I bid 4 9s, I'm taking a chance that they have two. But if I challenge, I'm taking a chance that they have zero or one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can change the digit. Since the current bid is 3 9s, I could bid 3 9s -> 3 9s isn't higher, so I need to go to a higher digit, but 9 is the highest. So, I can't increase the digit. So, the only way is to increase the quantity.\n\nWait, but the current bid is 3 9s. To make a higher bid, I can either go to 4 9s or 3 9s to a higher digit, but 9 is the highest. So, I have to go to 4 9s.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's a good move. Maybe I should challenge instead because I have two 9s, and the bid is three. If the other player has one, the total is three, so the bid is correct. If they have zero, the total is two, and the bid is wrong. So, challenging could be a good move because there's a chance the other player doesn't have any 9s.\n\nBut I don't know their hand. It's a bit of a gamble. Maybe I should consider the probability. Since each player has 8 digits, the chance that the other player has a 9 is based on the remaining digits. I have two 9s, so there are six digits left in the other player's hand. The total number of 9s in the game could be two (me) plus whatever they have.\n\nIf the current bid is 3 9s, they must think there are at least three. So, maybe they have one or two. If they have one, total is three. If they have two, total is four. So, if I challenge, I'm betting that the total is less than three, which would mean the other player has zero. But if they have one or two, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, if I bid 4 9s, I'm betting that the total is at least four. If the other player has two, I'm correct. If they have one, I'm wrong. If they have none, I'm wrong.\n\nSo, considering the risk, maybe challenging is better because if the other player has zero, I win. But if they have one, I lose. It's a gamble.\n\nWait, but I have two 9s. If I challenge, and the total is three, I lose. If it's two, I win. So, the other player's hand determines this. I don't know, but maybe it's worth taking the chance because the bid seems high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should bid 4 9s because I have two, and if the other player has two, it makes four. But I'm not sure.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. The current bid is 3 9s. I have two 9s. So, the other player has either one or two 9s. If I bid 4 9s, I'm assuming they have two. But if they have one, the total is three, and my bid is wrong. If I challenge, I'm assuming they have zero or one. If they have one, the total is three, and I lose. If they have zero, I win.\n\nSo, it's a 50-50 chance. Maybe I should challenge because it's a higher risk but could lead to a win.\n\nWait, but the other player might have a reason to bid 3 9s. Maybe they have two 9s, making the total four. So, if I challenge, I lose. But if I bid 4 9s, I'm correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I bid 4 9s, I have to consider if the other player has two 9s. If they do, the total is four, so my bid is correct. If they have one, the total is three, so my bid is wrong.\n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Maybe I should bid 4 9s because I have two, and it's possible the other player has two as well. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but the other player could also have only one 9. So, it's a risk. Maybe I should challenge instead because I have two, and the bid is three, so if the other player has zero, I win. If they have one, I lose.\n\nI think I'll go with challenging because I have two 9s, and the bid is three. There's a chance the other player doesn't have any, making the total two, which is less than three. So, challenging might be the better move here.\n"
