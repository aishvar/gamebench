Given my hand '75201018', I count 3 '8s'. Player 0's bid of '4 8s' seems suspiciously high because if they have 8 secret digits, it's unlikely they have more than 4 '8s' themselves. However, without exact information on Player 0's hand, I must focus on my own hand and make a strategic decision. I can see there's a possibility that Player 0 might be bluffing or overestimating. My hand contains 3 '8s', and I also see a '7'. The previous bids have been either '8s' or '7s'. Since I have 3 '7s' or '8s' in total isn't possible as my digits are 7, 5, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 8, I only have 1 '7' and 3 '8s' aren't there but 3 '8s' and 1 '7'. I can bid higher on '8s' or switch to another digit. I have 3 '8s', so bidding '5 8s' would be valid but risky. Instead, I notice I have 1 '7'. If I bid on '7s', I could potentially make a valid higher bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: Q D\"\n}\n```",
