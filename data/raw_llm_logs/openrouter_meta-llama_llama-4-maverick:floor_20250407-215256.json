Since there are 2 players and each has 8 digits, the total count of 0s can't exceed 8 (if the other player had all 0s). The bid of 2 0s is relatively low considering the maximum possible count is 16 and the other player can have at most 8. However, I can see that I have no 0s, so the count is at least 2 if the other player has 2 or more 0s. To exceed the current bid, I need to bid on a higher digit or a higher count. My hand has 1 '1', so I know the count of '1's is at least 1. The previous bid was 1 1s, so I can bid higher than that. I will bid on a higher count of '1's.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 1s\"\n}\n```",
