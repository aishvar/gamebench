The most frequent digit in my hand is '9' and '3' with 3 occurrences each, and '8' and '6' and '2' with 1 or 2 occurrences. A reasonable starting bid should be based on the count of a digit that is likely to be relatively common across both hands. Since I have 3 '9's, I can start by bidding on '9's with a quantity that is a bit more than half of the total possible count across both hands, which is 16 / 2 = 8. So, a bid of 5 '9's seems reasonable as it is a conservative start.\", \"action\": \"BID: 5 9s\"}",
