You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of 2 7s. My hand is 96958203. Let me list out my digits: 9, 6, 9, 5, 8, 2, 0, 3. So I have two 9s, one 6, one 5, one 8, one 2, one 0, and one 3. \n\nFirst, the current bid is 2 7s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity to 3 or keep the same quantity (2) but pick a higher digit. Since 7 is the current digit, a higher digit would be 8, 9, etc. \n\nLooking at my hand, I don't have any 7s. That's important because the bid is about 7s. Since I have zero 7s, maybe the opponent has some, but I can't know. The total possible 7s between both players could be up to 8 (if both have all 7s, but that's unlikely). \n\nIf I want to bid higher, options are:\n\nOption 1: Increase quantity to 3. The digit could be 7, 8, 9, etc. But since I don't have any 7s, if I bid 3 7s, I'm assuming the opponent has at least one. But maybe risky. Alternatively, maybe choose a higher digit where I have more. \n\nLooking at my digits, I have two 9s. So maybe bid 2 9s? But since the current bid is 2 7s, a bid of 2 9s would be higher because the digit is higher. That's a valid bid. Alternatively, I could go for 3 of a digit I have some of, like 3 9s? Wait, I only have two 9s. So 3 would require the opponent to have at least one 9. Alternatively, maybe bid 3 of another digit where I have one, but then the opponent would need to have two more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bidding 2 9s is a safer option. Since 2 9s is higher than 2 7s. That's a valid move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe even higher digits. Like 2 9s is better than 2 8s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe increasing the quantity. Let's see. If I choose to raise the quantity to 3, but pick a digit where I have some. For example, if I bid 3 9s, I have two, so the opponent would need to have at least one. But I don't know their hand, so that's a gamble. Alternatively, maybe a digit I don't have, but it's lower risk? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to bid 2 9s, since that's a higher digit with the same quantity. That way, I don't have to increase the quantity, which might be safer. \n\nAlternatively, is there a better digit? Let's see, the next highest digit after 7 is 8, 9. Since I have an 8 and two 9s, 9 is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent's bid of 2 7s is not too high. Since there are 8 digits each, total of 16. The bid is 2 7s. The chance that there are two 7s total is possible. If I have none, maybe the opponent has two? Or one? \n\nIf I challenge, then we check the total. If the total is less than 2, I win. But if it's exactly 2, then the bidder (Player 0) wins. Since I have 0, the opponent must have at least 2 to make it 2. If they have two, then the bid is valid. But if they have only one, then challenging would win. \n\nSo challenging is risky because if the opponent has two, I lose. But if I think they might have only one or none, then challenge could work. But without knowing their hand, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, making a bid that's higher. Since I have two 9s, maybe bid 2 9s, which is a higher digit. That's a valid bid. That might be safer because even if the opponent has no 9s, then the total is 2, so the bid of 2 9s would be valid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe go higher. Let's see, if I bid 3 of something. Let's see, if I have two 9s, maybe bid 3 9s. But that requires opponent to have at least one 9. If they don't, then someone would have to challenge later. But maybe that's pushing it. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 9s, that's a safer move. Since the current bid is 2 7s, moving to 2 9s is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent might have 7s, so bidding 2 9s is a good move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the likelihood. The bid is 2 7s. Since I have none, the opponent could have up to 8, but probably they have maybe one or two. But if I bid 2 9s, then the total would be my two plus whatever they have. If they have none, then the bid of 2 is exactly met. So that's okay. \n\nSo the best move is probably to bid 2 9s. That way, I don't increase the quantity but go higher in digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe even bid 3 of a lower digit but higher quantity. Like 3 6s, but I only have one 6. That's risky. \n\nAlternatively, 3 0s? I have one 0. \n\nHmm. Bidding 2 9s is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent might have a 9. Let's see. If they have one 9, then total 3, so 2 9s would be valid. If they have none, then exactly 2. \n\nSo that's a safe bid. \n\nTherefore, the action should be BID: 2 9s. \n\nWait, but the current bid is 2 7s. To make a higher bid, either higher quantity or same quantity with higher digit. So 2 9s is valid. \n\nYes, so that's the best move. \n\nSo the reasoning would be something like: The current bid is 2 7s. I have two 9s, so bidding 2 9s is a higher digit with the same quantity, which is valid. This avoids increasing the quantity and leverages my existing digits."
