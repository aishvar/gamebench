You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I'm Player 0, and the current bid is None, so I need to make the first bid. My hand is 33847006. Let me count the digits I have. \n\nLooking at my hand: 3, 3, 8, 4, 7, 0, 0, 6. So, the digits are:\n\n- 0: 2 times\n- 3: 2 times\n- 4: 1\n- 6: 1\n- 7: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nSo the most frequent digits in my hand are 0 and 3, each appearing twice. Since I have two 0s and two 3s, maybe I can start with one of those. But since the bid has to be a quantity and a digit, and the next player has 8 digits as well, the total possible for any digit is 16 (since each player has 8, but digits can overlap). \n\nSince it's the first bid, I want to start with a reasonable but not too high bid. Let's think: if I bid 2 of a digit, that's possible because I have two in my hand, and the opponent might have some. For example, if I bid 2 3s, that's safe because I have two, and maybe the opponent has one or two. But maybe starting with a higher digit would be better. Wait, the bid has to be strictly higher than the current bid, which is None. So any bid is allowed here.\n\nBut the strategy is to start with a bid that's likely true but not too easy to challenge. Since I have two 0s and two 3s, maybe starting with 2 3s. Alternatively, since 0 is a common digit, maybe 2 0s. But the opponent's hand is unknown. However, since there are 16 digits in total (8 each), the maximum possible for any digit is 16, but realistically, it's probably lower. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit to make the next player's bid harder. For example, if I bid 2 8s, but I only have one 8. The opponent might have none, so the total would be 1, which is less than 2. But that's risky. But since I'm the first bidder, maybe a safer approach is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity but higher digit. Wait, the rules say that a higher bid is either higher quantity or same quantity with higher digit. So if I start with 2 3s, the next player can either bid 3 of any digit, or 2 of a higher digit. \n\nBut since I have two 3s, and the opponent might have some, maybe 2 3s is a safe starting bid. Alternatively, 2 0s, since I have two 0s. Let me check which digit is higher. 0 is lower than 3, so if I bid 2 0s, the next player can bid 2 1s, 2 2s, etc., up to 2 9s. But if I bid 2 3s, the next player can bid 2 4s or higher, or increase the quantity. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit to make the next bid harder. For example, 2 8s. But I only have one 8. If the opponent has none, the total is 1, which is less than 2. But if I bid 2 8s, and the opponent challenges, I lose. But since it's the first bid, maybe the opponent won't challenge immediately unless they have none. But that's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity but higher digit. Wait, but the first bid can be any. So maybe the safest is to start with a bid that's true based on my hand. For example, I have two 0s and two 3s. If I bid 2 0s, that's a true statement if the opponent has at least 0. But the opponent could have 0, 1, or more. But since there are 8 digits in their hand, the total could be up to 8+2=10 for 0s. Wait, no, the total possible for any digit is 16 (both players have 8 each). But realistically, the opponent's hand could have any number. \n\nBut since I have two 0s, the minimum total is 2 (if opponent has none) and maximum 10 (if opponent has 8). So if I bid 2 0s, that's a safe bid because the actual count is at least 2. So that's a valid bid. Similarly, 2 3s is also safe. \n\nBut since the first bid, maybe start with the highest possible digit in my hand. Wait, the highest digit in my hand is 8. But I have only one 8. So if I bid 1 8s, that's true (since I have one), but the next player can easily bid higher. Alternatively, maybe start with 2 3s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher quantity but lower digit. For example, 3 0s. But I have two, so the opponent needs to have at least one. But that's a risk. If the opponent has none, then the total is 2, which is less than 3, so if they challenge, I lose. So that's risky. \n\nSo the safest first bid is to bid the number of a digit that I have, so that the total is at least that. For example, if I have two 0s, bid 2 0s. That's a safe bid because even if the opponent has none, the total is 2, which meets the bid. Wait, no: the bid is the total across all players. If I bid 2 0s, and the opponent has none, the total is 2, which is equal to the bid. So the bid is valid. Because the rule says \"at least\" the quantity. So 2 0s would be a valid bid even if the total is exactly 2. \n\nSo that's a safe bid. Similarly, 2 3s is safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, 2 8s. But I have one 8. If the opponent has at least one, then the total is 2, which meets the bid. If they have none, the total is 1, which is less than 2, so the bid is invalid. So that's a risk. \n\nSo the safest approach is to bid a quantity equal to the number in my hand for a digit. So 2 0s or 2 3s. \n\nBetween 0 and 3, which is better? Since 0 is a lower digit, if I bid 2 0s, the next player can bid 2 of any higher digit (like 2 1s, 2 2s, etc.) or increase the quantity. If I bid 2 3s, the next player can bid 2 4s or higher, or 3 of any digit. \n\nBut 0 is a lower digit, so maybe starting with 2 3s is better because it's a higher digit, making the next player's options more limited. For example, if I bid 2 3s, the next player can either bid 3 of any digit (which is higher quantity) or 2 of a higher digit (4-9). But if I bid 2 0s, the next player can bid 2 of any digit from 1-9, which gives them more options. \n\nSo perhaps starting with 2 3s is better because it's a higher digit, reducing the next player's options. Alternatively, maybe starting with 2 0s is better because 0s are more common. Wait, but in my hand, I have two 0s and two 3s. The opponent's hand is unknown. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher quantity. For example, 3 0s. But that's risky because I only have two. If the opponent has none, the total is 2, which is less than 3. So if they challenge, I lose. But since it's the first bid, maybe the opponent is less likely to challenge immediately. But that's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 2 0s. Since I have two, and the opponent might have some, it's a safe bid. The total is at least 2. So the bid is valid. Then the next player has to either bid higher. \n\nSo considering all this, the safest first bid would be 2 0s or 2 3s. Let's choose 2 0s because 0 is a lower digit, but maybe more common. Wait, but in my hand, 0s are two, same as 3s. But in general, 0 might be more common in the opponent's hand. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 2 3s. Let's say I bid 2 3s. Then the next player can bid 2 4s, 2 5s, etc., or 3 of any digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 1 8s. But that's a low quantity, but high digit. But the next player can easily bid 1 9s, which is higher. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to start with a bid that's safe and gives me flexibility. So 2 0s is safe. Let's go with that.\n"
