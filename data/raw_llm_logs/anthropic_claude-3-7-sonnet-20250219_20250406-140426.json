        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 3 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 24 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

With 16 unknown digits between the other players, it\\'s certainly possible they have 2 or more 5s. However, I also notice that Player 1 has been consistently bidding on 5s, first with 2 5s and now with 4 5s, which suggests they may have several 5s in their hand. Looking at the bidding history, Player 0 seems confident in 4s, and I already bid on 1s (I have one 1 in my hand). I could increase to 5 5s, but that\\'s risky since I only have 2. I could switch to a digit I have more of, like 8s (I have one 8), but I\\'d need to bid at least 5 8s to be higher than 4 5s. Given my hand, I think the safest move is to bid 4 6s, which is higher than 4 5s because of the higher digit, and I don\\'t need to increase the quantity.\", \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"}', type='text')"
