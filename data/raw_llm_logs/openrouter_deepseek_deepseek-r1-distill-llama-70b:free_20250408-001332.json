You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn to make a bid since there are no previous bids. My hand is 13167047. Let me think about what this means. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze my own digits. Let me list them out: 1, 3, 1, 6, 7, 0, 4, 7. So, I have two 1s, one 3, one 6, two 7s, one 0, and one 4. That gives me a count for each digit. \n\nSince there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total number of digits in play is 16. The possible digits are from 0 to 9. My goal is to make a bid that's likely to be true but not too obvious, or to challenge if I think the previous bid is false. But since there's no bid yet, I just need to start with a reasonable one.\n\nI remember that in Liar's Poker, the first bid can set the tone. I should choose a digit that I have at least one of, and a quantity that's plausible. Looking at my hand, I have two 7s. That's a good starting point because 7 is a high digit, which could give me an advantage if I need to increase the bid later. \n\nSo, if I bid 2 7s, that's a safe start. Since the total possible 7s could be up to 16, but realistically, it's unlikely there are that many. But since I have two, it's a solid foundation. Plus, 7 is a high digit, which might make it harder for the opponent to challenge right away because they might not have many 7s themselves.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 1s since I have two of them. But 1 is a lower digit, so it's easier for the opponent to potentially have more or to challenge. Bidding on 7s seems better because it's a stronger digit. \n\nI should also consider the maximum possible. If I bid 2 7s, the opponent might have 0 to, say, 6 more 7s. But since I have two, the total could be anywhere from 2 to 14. But 2 is a low number, so it's a safe bet. \n\nI don't have any 8s, 9s, or 5s, so bidding on those would be risky. 6 is a possibility, but I only have one, so maybe not the best choice. 0 is also an option, but I have only one, and it's a low digit. \n\nSo, putting it all together, starting with 2 7s seems like the best move. It's a bid that's definitely true based on my hand, and it's a high enough digit to give me flexibility in future moves.\n"
