You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I need to analyze my hand and the current bid. My hand is 58977064. Let's count my digits: 5, 8, 9, 7, 7, 0, 6, 4. So, I have one 5, one 8, one 9, two 7s, one 0, one 6, and one 4. The current bid is 3 3s. Since I don't have any 3s, the total number of 3s depends on the opponent's hand. The maximum possible 3s they could have is 8 (if all their digits are 3s), but that's unlikely. However, the bid is 3 3s, so if I think the total is less than 3, I should challenge. But I don't know their hand. Alternatively, I can make a higher bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 7s, maybe I can bid 4 7s, hoping that between my two 7s and their possible 7s, we reach at least 4. Alternatively, since the current digit is 3, I can bid the same quantity (3) but a higher digit, like 3 4s, but I have one 4. If I bid 3 4s, the total would be my 1 plus their possible 4s. If they have two or more, it's valid. But I don't know. Another option is to bid higher quantity with a lower digit. For example, 4 0s, since I have a 0. But if I have one 0, they might have some. Alternatively, 4 5s since I have one 5. But the safest might be to go with the 7s because I have two. Let's see, if I bid 4 7s, the total needs to be at least 4. I have two, so they need to have at least two. If they have none, then it's 2, which is less than 4, and I would lose if challenged. But since I'm the one making the bid, I need to think if it's a good risk. Alternatively, maybe a higher digit with the same quantity. 3 7s. Wait, the current bid is 3 3s. To make a higher bid, same quantity but higher digit: 3 4s, 3 5s, etc. Since I have a 4, maybe 3 4s is safer. If I bid 3 4s, the total 4s would be my 1 plus theirs. If they have at least 2, then it's valid. But I don't know. Alternatively, maybe 3 7s. Since I have two 7s, if I bid 3 7s, the total would be my 2 plus theirs. If they have at least 1, then it's 3. That's possible. So 3 7s is a possible bid. But the current bid is 3 3s. So 3 7s is higher because the digit is higher. So that's a valid bid. Alternatively, increasing the quantity: 4 3s. But since I don't have any 3s, that's risky. If I bid 4 3s, and the opponent has, say, 3, then total is 3, which is less than 4, so I would lose if challenged. But maybe the opponent doesn't have many 3s. Alternatively, maybe the opponent bid 3 3s because they have some. It's hard to tell. Considering all this, maybe the safest higher bid is to go with 3 7s, since I have two, and even if the opponent has one, that makes 3. Or maybe 4 7s, but that's riskier. Alternatively, challenge the 3 3s. If I challenge, and the total 3s are less than 3, I win. But I have zero 3s. So the total 3s depend on the opponent's hand. If the opponent has at least 3, then the bid is valid. If they have 2 or less, then it's invalid. Since I don't know their hand, it's a gamble. But in Liar's Poker, you often have to bluff or make educated guesses. Since the opponent bid 3 3s, maybe they have some 3s. If they have one or two, the total would be 1 or 2, which is less than 3. Wait, no: if the opponent has, say, two 3s, then total is 2 (since I have none), which is less than 3. So the bid would be invalid. So if I challenge, and the total is less than 3, I win. But if the opponent has three or more 3s, then the bid is valid, and I lose. So the question is, how likely is the opponent to have three or more 3s. Since each player has 8 digits, the probability that they have three or more 3s is... well, it's possible but not certain. Without any information, it's a 50-50 guess. But maybe in the context of the game, players might bluff. The opponent might have bid 3 3s to test if I have any. Since I don't, maybe they're bluffing. So challenging could be a good move here. Alternatively, making a higher bid transfers the pressure to them. Let's think: if I bid 3 7s, then they have to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. If they have no 7s, they might challenge, and if the total is 2 (my two 7s), then the bid is invalid, and they would win. So that's risky. Alternatively, if I bid 4 7s, and I have two, they need to have at least two. If they have one, total is 3, which is less than 4, so invalid. So that's even riskier. Maybe the safest higher bid is to increase the digit but keep the quantity the same. So 3 4s. Since I have one 4, if the opponent has two or more, then it's valid. But again, uncertain. Alternatively, 3 5s. I have one 5. If they have two, total is 3. So that's possible. Hmm. This is tricky. Considering all options, maybe challenging is better here. Because if the opponent has three 3s, they might have bid higher. But they bid 3 3s. If they have exactly three, they might be confident. But it's possible they're bluffing. Since I have no information, maybe the best move is to challenge, assuming that the opponent doesn't have three 3s. The reasoning is that it's early in the game, and they might be testing. So I'll go with CHALLENGE.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
