You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of 2 0s from Player 0. My hand is 72710128. Let me first check how many 0s I have here. Looking at my digits: 7, 2, 7, 1, 0, 1, 2, 8. Oh, there's one 0 in my hand. So the total number of 0s between both players could be more, but right now the bid is 2. Since I only have one, maybe the opponent has one or two? \n\nThe current bid is 2 0s. To make a valid bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity but a higher digit. Since 0 is the lowest digit, if I want to keep the same quantity (2), I have to choose a digit higher than 0, like 1, 2, up to 9. Alternatively, I could bid a higher quantity, like 3 of any digit.\n\nLet me think about the possible digits in my hand. My digits are 7,2,7,1,0,1,2,8. Let's count each digit:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 2 (positions 4 and 6)\n- 2: 2 (positions 2 and 7)\n- 7: 2 (positions 1 and 3)\n- 8: 1\n- The rest (3,4,5,6,9) are 0 in my hand.\n\nSo, for digits I have multiple of, like 1, 2, 7, maybe I can use those. \n\nIf I want to bid higher than 2 0s, I can either go for 3 of a digit (since 3 is higher than 2) or 2 of a higher digit than 0, which could be any digit from 1 to 9. \n\nLet's evaluate options:\n\nOption 1: Bid 2 of a higher digit. The lowest possible here is 2 1s. But since I have two 1s, maybe that's a safe bet? Wait, but the total count would be my 2 plus whatever the opponent has. If I bid 2 1s, but the opponent might have some 1s too. However, the current bid is 2 0s, so my bid of 2 1s would be higher in digit, so that's a valid bid. But is that a good move? Alternatively, maybe I can go for a higher quantity.\n\nOption 2: Bid 3 of a digit. Let's see. The digits I have two of are 1,2,7. So 3 of any of those would require assuming the opponent has at least one more. For example, if I bid 3 1s, I have two, so maybe the opponent has one. But I don't know their hand. Alternatively, maybe 3 2s? Same logic. Or 3 7s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bidding a higher digit with same quantity. For instance, 2 7s. Since 7 is higher than 0, and my hand has two 7s. That's a valid bid. But maybe that's too low. Alternatively, 2 8s? But I only have one 8. Hmm, but in Liar's Poker, you don't have to have the digit in your hand to bid it. Wait, right, the bid is about the total of both players. So even if I don't have a digit, I can still bid it. So maybe that's a consideration.\n\nWait, but if I bid 2 1s, since I have two, even if the opponent has none, the total is 2, which would make the bid of 2 1s valid, but the previous bid was 2 0s. Wait no, the bid has to be strictly higher. The previous bid is 2 0s. A bid of 2 1s would be higher in digit but same quantity, so that's allowed. So that's a valid bid, but would that be a good idea?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go higher. Let's see. The current bid is 2 0s. To challenge, I have to think if it's possible that the total number of 0s is at least 2. I have one 0, so if the opponent has at least one, then the bid is valid. Since there are two players, each has 8 digits, so total digits 16. The opponent has 8 digits, so they could have one or more 0s. The bid is 2 0s. If I challenge, and they have at least one 0, then the total would be at least 2 (since I have one, they have one) making the bid correct. So challenging might be risky because there's a good chance they have at least one 0. \n\nTherefore, challenging might not be the best move here. \n\nSo better to make a bid. Let's think of the best bid. \n\nOption: Bidding 2 1s. Since I have two 1s, the total could be 2 or more. But maybe the opponent has a 1, so the bid of 2 1s is safe? Wait, but if I bid 2 1s, the next player can then bid higher. Alternatively, maybe a higher quantity.\n\nAlternatively, bidding 3 of a digit I have two of. Let's say 3 1s. Since I have two, if the opponent has one, that's three. But if they have none, then it's only two, so challenging would fail. But since I'm the one making the bid, if they challenge, then if total is less than 3, I lose. So maybe that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 3 7s. I have two, so opponent needs one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a higher digit. Let me see. The highest digit I have is 8, but I only have one. So maybe 2 8s. Since I have one, opponent might have one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe go for a higher quantity. Let's see, the current bid is 2 0s. To go higher in quantity, I can bid 3 of any digit. Let's pick a digit that I have some of. Let's say 3 1s. Since I have two, that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 3 2s. I have two 2s, so maybe opponent has one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 2 7s. That's a higher digit than 0, same quantity. \n\nWhich is better? \n\nThe problem is that if I go with a lower quantity but higher digit, like 2 1s, that's a valid bid. Alternatively, increasing the quantity to 3, but with a lower digit. \n\nHmm. Since the current bid is 2 0s, the next bid could be either:\n\n- Higher quantity (3 or more) with any digit, or \n\n- Same quantity (2) but higher digit (1-9).\n\nSo, to choose between those options. \n\nIf I choose to increase the quantity to 3, I have to pick a digit where I think the total might be at least that. Let's say 3 1s. Since I have two, even if opponent has none, total is 2, so that would be a lie. But maybe they have a 1? \n\nAlternatively, if I choose to go with same quantity but higher digit, like 2 1s. Since I have two, even if opponent has none, the total is 2, so the bid is exactly 2, which meets the bid. Wait, no, the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So 2 1s would be valid if there are at least two 1s. Since I have two, that's exactly two. So it would be valid. So that's a safe bid. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 7s, that's even better in terms of digit value, so higher. \n\nWait, 2 7s would be better than 2 1s. Since 7 is higher than 1, so the bid would be better. \n\nSo maybe the best same-quantity bid is the highest possible digit. Since I have a 7 and 8, but 8 is only one. \n\nWait, for 2 8s, I have one, opponent might have one. So total could be 2. So bidding 2 8s would be valid. \n\nAlternatively, 2 7s, since I have two 7s, so even if opponent has none, the total is 2, so that's exactly 2, which meets the bid. \n\nSo 2 7s would be a valid bid, and it's better than 2 1s or 2 0s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe even better to go for higher digit. \n\nSo 2 8s? Let's see. I have one 8, so opponent would need to have at least one. If they have zero, then total is 1, so bid of 2 8s would be invalid. So that's a risk. \n\nWhereas 2 7s is safer because I already have two. \n\nSo maybe the best bid here is 2 7s. \n\nAlternatively, going for a higher quantity. Let's see, 3 of something. \n\nIf I bid 3 1s, I have two, so maybe opponent has one. If they don't, then challenge would lose. But maybe that's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, 3 2s. I have two 2s. \n\nAlternatively, 3 7s. I have two, so need opponent to have one. \n\nBut if I go for higher quantity, it's riskier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest is to bid 2 7s, which is valid because I have two, so even if opponent has none, it's exactly 2. \n\nTherefore, the bid would be \"BID: 2 7s\". \n\nWait, but the current bid is 2 0s. So 2 7s is a valid bid because the quantity is same but digit is higher. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe even higher digit. Like 2 8s, but that's riskier. \n\nAlternatively, 2 9s? But I don't have any 9s. But that's a higher digit. But since the total could be zero, that's a bad idea. \n\nSo the best bid is either 2 7s or 2 8s (if I think opponent might have one 8). \n\nBut since I have two 7s, 2 7s is safer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe even bid 3 1s. Let's see, if I have two 1s, and opponent has one, then 3 is okay. But if they have none, then it's a lie. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent's bid of 2 0s might be a bluff. Since they only have their own hand. If they have, say, one 0, then the total would be 1 (if I have none). Wait, but I have one 0. So their bid of 2 0s requires that their hand plus mine has at least two 0s. Since I have one, they need at least one. \n\nIf I challenge, and they have zero 0s, then the total is 1, which is less than 2, so I win. But if they have at least one, then I lose. \n\nThe chance depends on their hand. Since each player has 8 digits, the probability that they have at least one 0 is: \n\nTotal digits: 16, but my hand has one 0. So remaining digits are 15, with 9 possible 0s left (since total 0s in all digits could be up to 16, but I have one). Wait, actually, the total possible 0s across all hands is variable, but each digit in each hand is random. \n\nAssuming uniform distribution, but since it's Liar's Poker, the actual digits are fixed but unknown. \n\nBut without knowing their hand, challenging is risky. \n\nTherefore, better to bid. \n\nSo between the options, bidding 2 7s is safe because I have two, so the bid is valid even if they have none. \n\nSo I'll go with that.\n"
