For the bid to be true, Player 1 needs to have at least one '8' in their 8-digit hand. The probability of Player 1 having at least one '8' is reasonably high (estimated around 57%), making a challenge risky. I should make a higher bid. Options include increasing the digit ('2 9s') or increasing the quantity ('3 0s', '3 1s', etc.). I have two '3's in my hand. Bidding '3 3s' leverages this strength. This bid requires Player 1 to have at least one '3' for it to be true, which is also reasonably probable (~57%). This bid is stronger than '2 9s' (which only requires one '9' from Player 1, same as '2 8s' required one '8') because it increases the quantity and is based on the digit I hold most frequently. It puts more pressure on Player 1.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 3s\"\n}\n```",
