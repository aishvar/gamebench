        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

Considering the opponent's bid history, they seem to be making somewhat conservative bids. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 8, bidding higher on 8s might not be the best strategy without more information. However, I can try to increase the digit, considering my hand contains other digits. Noticing my hand has a couple of digits that appear more than once, I might consider bidding on those, but since I need to bid higher than '2 8s', I should look for a digit that is higher than 8 or bid a higher quantity of a lower digit if I feel confident. Given the digits in my hand and the need to bid higher, I could consider bidding on a higher digit if I had any, but since 9 is the only digit higher than 8 and I don't have any 9s, I must consider either challenging or finding a reasonable increase based on the digits I do have. Since challenging seems risky without a strong reason to believe the current bid is incorrect and I don't have enough information to confidently bid higher on any digit, I should consider my next move carefully. Given the constraints and aiming to make a strategic move, I notice that bidding on a digit I have more of could be beneficial, but all my digits are either singular or not high enough to comfortably bid higher than '2 8s' without risking a challenge. Thus, the safest increase would be to either challenge if I think '2 8s' is unlikely or find a digit where I can reasonably assume there might be at least the quantity bid. Considering my hand and the bid, I decide to challenge because '2 8s' seems like a manageable bid and I only have one 8, suggesting the opponent might have at least one, fulfilling the bid condition. However, without clear evidence of a higher digit or quantity I can confidently bid on, challenging the current bid seems like a strategic move to test the opponent's bid validity.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
