However, since Player 1 has made this bid, I need to consider if they are bluffing or if they genuinely have at least two 4s. Given that I have seen no other bids indicating a higher count for 4s and I have the same count, I can either challenge or raise. Raising would mean I need to bid at least 3 4s, which is possible but risky, as I am unsure of Player 1's hand.
