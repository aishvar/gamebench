You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by looking at the information I have.\n\nMy hand is 72936485. That means I have the digits 7, 2, 9, 3, 6, 4, 8, and 5. So, in my own hand, I have one 9, one 8, one 7, etc. No duplicates except for the digits I have. \n\nThe current bid is 2 9s, made by Player 1. The bid history shows that I started by bidding 1 9, and then Player 1 upped it to 2 9s. Now it's my turn again. I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible counts of 9s. Since each player has 8 digits, there are a total of 16 digits in play. The current bid is 2 9s, so Player 1 is claiming that there are at least two 9s between both of us.\n\nI have one 9 in my hand. So, if Player 1 has at least one 9, the total would be two. If they have more, the total would be higher. But if they have zero, then the total is just one, which would make their bid of 2 false.\n\nNow, considering that I have one 9, I can think about the likelihood that Player 1 has another 9. Since the bid is 2 9s, they could be trying to bluff, or they might actually have another 9.\n\nIf I challenge, and the total number of 9s is less than 2, I win. If it's 2 or more, they win. So, I need to assess the probability that there's another 9 in Player 1's hand.\n\nLooking at the digits I have, I don't see any other 9s. So, the only way the total is 2 or more is if Player 1 has at least one 9. But without knowing their hand, it's hard to be certain.\n\nAnother angle is to consider the previous bids. I started with 1 9, which is a low bid. Player 1 then raised it to 2 9s. Maybe they have a 9, or maybe they're trying to bluff. If they're bluffing, challenging would be a good move. If they're not, then I might lose.\n\nAlternatively, I could make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 2 9s, I could either bid a higher quantity of 9s (like 3 9s) or the same quantity but a higher digit. But looking at my hand, I don't have enough of any digit to make a significantly higher bid confidently. For example, I have one 8, one 7, etc. So, making a bid like 3 8s would require that there are at least three 8s in total, which seems unlikely because I only have one.\n\nTherefore, considering the options, challenging seems more plausible. If Player 1 only has one 9 or none, I win. But if they have two or more, I lose. Given that I have one 9, the chance that they have another is possible, but maybe not too high, especially if they're trying to bluff.\n\nSo, weighing the risks, I think challenging is the better move here. It's a 50-50 chance, but given the potential payoff, it's worth taking the risk.\n"
