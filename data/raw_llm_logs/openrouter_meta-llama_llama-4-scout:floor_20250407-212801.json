To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have enough sevens to increase the quantity confidently (as 3 is the maximum I can confirm), I should consider increasing the digit. The digits in my hand are 3, 7, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, and 6. The highest digit I have multiple instances of is 8 (two 8s), but I also see that I have two 4s. However, bidding on 8s or 4s wouldn't directly counter the current bid effectively without considering the possibility of Player 0 having more 7s than they claimed or the distribution of other numbers. Given that I have 3 sevens and the goal is to make a higher bid or challenge, I should consider if challenging could be an option or if I can safely increase the bid. If I challenge and lose, I risk being out of the game, but if I bid and lose, I only waste my turn. The current bid seems potentially beatable or challengeable based on the hands, but without exact information on Player 0's hand, I must make an educated guess.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 8s\"\n}\n```",
