For the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least three 7s in their 8-digit hand. Assuming digits are uniformly distributed, the probability of a single player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is low (approximately P(X>=3) for Binomial(n=8, p=0.1) which is about 3.8%). Since I have confirmed zero 7s, the probability of the bid being valid rests entirely on the opponent's hand, making it highly unlikely. Therefore, challenging the bid is the statistically sound move.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
