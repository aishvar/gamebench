        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '8 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

The total number of digits in play is 16, so it's possible that there are 8 6s. However, the bid history suggests that Player 1 has been trying to outmaneuver me. The bid of 8 6s is a significant increase from the previous bid of 7 9s. I need to assess whether it's likely that Player 1 has additional 6s beyond what I can see. Given that I have two 6s and there are 14 other digits, it's not impossible that there are 6 more 6s out there. However, bidding higher seems challenging. I can either challenge or bid higher. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity to 9 or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Increasing the digit to 7 or higher isn't an option since I'm already at 6s, and going to a higher digit without a quantity increase isn't valid. So, I can bid 9 0s or higher. Before doing that, I should consider if challenging is a better option. Challenging seems risky given that there are potentially 6 more 6s out there. I'll analyze my hand again: I have 01964373, which has two 3s and two other numbers that could potentially be 6s if the other player has a lot of 6s. Given the information, bidding 9 0s is a safer bet as it increases the quantity and is a relatively conservative bid considering the total count of digits.\", \"action\": \"BID: 9 0s\"}",
