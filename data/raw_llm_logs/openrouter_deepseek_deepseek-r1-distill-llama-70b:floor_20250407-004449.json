You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in Liar's Poker, each player has 8 secret digits, and the goal is to bid on the total count of a specific digit across both players' hands. The current bid is 2 1s, made by Player 0. My hand is 06412742. I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have the digits 0, 6, 4, 1, 2, 7, 4, 2. Let me count how many of each digit I have:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 4: 2\n- 6: 1\n- 7: 1\n\nSo, in my hand, the digits I have are 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7. Now, the current bid is 2 1s. That means Player 0 is claiming that there are at least two 1s in total between both players.\n\nFrom my hand, I have one 1. So, if Player 0's bid is correct, they must have at least one more 1 in their hand. But I don't know what their hand is. I need to consider the possibilities.\n\nIf I challenge the bid, and the total number of 1s is less than 2, I win. If it's 2 or more, Player 0 wins. So, what's the likelihood that the total 1s are at least 2?\n\nI have one 1. Player 0 could have zero, one, or more 1s. Since they made the bid of 2 1s, they might have at least one 1, making the total two. But it's also possible they have zero, thinking I have two. But I only have one, so if they have zero, the total is just one, and the bid would be false.\n\nI don't have enough information to be certain, but I can try to make an educated guess. If I challenge and the total is 1, I win. If it's 2 or more, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, I could make a higher bid. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the current bid is 2 1s, I could bid 3 of a higher digit or the same digit with a higher quantity.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 2s and two 4s. So, I could potentially bid 2 2s or 2 4s. But wait, the current bid is 2 1s. Bidding 2 2s would be a higher bid because the digit is higher, even though the quantity is the same. Similarly, 2 4s would be even higher.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid a higher quantity, like 3 of any digit. But I only have two 2s and two 4s, so I can't bid 3 of those. The next possible digit I have is 6 and 7, but I only have one each, so I can't bid higher on those.\n\nSo, if I bid 2 2s, that's a valid higher bid. Alternatively, 2 4s is even better because 4 is higher than 2. But I need to think about whether that's a safe bid.\n\nIf I bid 2 4s, the total number of 4s would need to be at least two. I have two 4s, so even if Player 0 has none, the total is two. So, that bid would be safe. Similarly, if I bid 2 2s, since I have two 2s, even if Player 0 has none, the total is two.\n\nBut wait, Player 0 might have some 2s or 4s as well. So, if I bid 2 4s, and Player 0 has one 4, the total would be three, which is still valid. If they have zero, it's two, which is still valid. So, that seems like a safe move.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 of a digit, but I don't have three of any digit. So, I can't do that.\n\nSo, considering all this, I have two options: challenge the current bid or make a higher bid. If I challenge and the total 1s are less than two, I win. If not, I lose. If I make a higher bid, I can choose a bid that I know is valid based on my hand, which would be 2 4s.\n\nSince I can make a bid that I'm certain is valid, it's safer to do that rather than challenging and risking losing. Plus, making a bid keeps the game going, and I can potentially force Player 0 into a tough spot.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to bid 2 4s. That way, I'm making a valid higher bid, and I'm sure that the total will be at least two because I have two 4s myself.\n"
