You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, let's figure out my next move in this Liar's Poker game. So, the current bid is 2 7s from Player 1, and it's my turn. My hand is 10103855. First, I should break down my hand to understand what digits I have.\n\nLooking at my hand: 1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 8, 5, 5. So, I have two 0s, two 1s, two 5s, a 3, and an 8. That's eight digits in total. Now, the current bid is 2 7s. I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid.\n\nI don't have any 7s in my hand, so I can't directly confirm if there are at least two 7s between both players. Since I have no 7s, the only way the bid could be valid is if Player 1 has both 7s in their hand. But considering that each player has eight digits, it's possible, but not very likely.\n\nLooking at the bid history, I started with 2 5s, and Player 1 upped it to 2 7s. Now, I have to either bid higher or challenge. If I challenge, and the total number of 7s is less than 2, I win. If it's 2 or more, Player 1 wins.\n\nGiven that I have no 7s, the maximum number of 7s Player 1 could have is 2, making the total exactly 2. But since I don't have any, if Player 1 also doesn't have any, the bid would be invalid. However, since Player 1 made the bid, they might have at least one 7, expecting me to have another, but I don't. So, the chance that there are exactly 2 is low, but not impossible.\n\nAlternatively, I could make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 2 7s, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. I have two 5s and two 0s, so maybe I can bid on those. But since the current bid is on 7s, which is a higher digit than 5 or 0, I might not want to go lower in digit. However, increasing the quantity on a lower digit could be an option.\n\nWait, but the rules state that a higher bid can be either a higher quantity or the same quantity but a higher digit. So, to make a valid bid, I need to either bid a higher quantity on any digit or the same quantity on a higher digit than 7s. But since 7 is already a high digit, the next higher digit would be 8 or 9. I have one 8 in my hand. Bidding 2 8s could be possible because if I have one, Player 1 might have another, making the total 2.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 5s since I have two 5s, but that would require Player 1 to have at least one 5. But I'm not sure about that. It might be safer to challenge the 2 7s bid because the likelihood of there being exactly two 7s is low, especially since I have none.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think challenging is the better option here. The risk of the bid being false seems higher than it being true, given my hand.\n"
