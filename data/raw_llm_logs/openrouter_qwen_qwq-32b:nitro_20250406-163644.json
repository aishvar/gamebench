You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of 3 0s. The current bid is 3 zeros. Since it's my turn as Player 1, I have to either make a higher bid or challenge.\n\nFirst, look at my hand: 63174868. Let me check how many zeros I have here. The digits are 6,3,1,7,4,8,6,8. There are no zeros in my hand. That's important. \n\nThe current bid is 3 0s. To make a higher bid, I could either increase the quantity to 4 and keep the digit 0, or keep the same quantity but choose a higher digit (like 3 1s, 3 2s, up to 3 9s). But since the digit has to be higher, if I keep the same quantity, the digit must be higher than 0. So options for a higher bid could be 4 0s, or any 3 [1-9]s. \n\nWait, but the bid must be strictly higher. The rules say higher quantity or same quantity with higher digit. So for example, 3 1s would be higher than 3 0s because the digit is higher. Alternatively, 4 0s would also be higher. \n\nNow, I need to decide which is better. Let me think about the total possible zeros in both hands. Since I have zero zeros, the opponent must have at least 3 zeros for their bid to be true. But if I can make a bid that's safer, maybe?\n\nAlternatively, challenging: If I challenge the current bid of 3 0s, then we check the total zeros. Since I have none, the opponent must have at least 3. If they have 3 or more, they win. If they have 2 or fewer, then I win. The question is, how likely is it that the opponent has 3 zeros?\n\nIn Liar's Poker, each player has 8 digits. So total digits are 16. The opponent has 8 digits. The bid is 3 0s. So if they have 3 zeros in their hand, plus any from my hand (which I don't have any), so total would be exactly their count. Since my hand has 0, the total zeros would be whatever they have. So if they have at least 3 zeros, their bid is valid. Otherwise, it's a lie.\n\nBut I don't know their hand. However, the bid is 3 0s. Since I have none, the actual total zeros are equal to their hand's zeros. To challenge, I'm betting that their hand has fewer than 3 zeros. \n\nIs that a good bet? Well, the probability of someone having 3 zeros in 8 digits... Let's think: each digit is 0-9, so the chance of a single digit being 0 is 1/10. The expected number of zeros in 8 digits is 0.8, so 3 is quite high. But in Liar's Poker, it's about strategy, not probabilities. Since I have no zeros, maybe the opponent is lying? But maybe they have some. \n\nAlternatively, making a bid. Let's see, if I bid 3 1s, that could be better. Let's see what's in my hand. My hand has one 1. So if I bid 3 1s, the total would need to be at least 3. Since I have one, the opponent would need at least two 1s. But I don't know their hand. Alternatively, maybe bid 4 0s? But that's risky because I have zero, so the opponent would need to have at least 4. That's even more unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe increasing the digit. For example, bid 3 1s. Let's check: the current bid is 3 0s, so 3 1s is a valid higher bid. But is that a good move? \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 3 9s. Since 9 is the highest digit, that's a strong bid. But do I have any 9s? My hand is 6,3,1,7,4,8,6,8. No 9s. So if I bid 3 9s, I'm claiming there are at least 3 nines in total. Since I have none, the opponent would need to have at least 3. That's a big ask. Maybe risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 3 6s. I have two 6s. So if I bid 3 6s, then the total needs to be at least 3. The opponent's hand has some digits, but I don't know. But if I have two, maybe they have one? But that's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 4 1s? But that's higher in quantity. Let's see, the current bid is 3 0s. So a bid of 4 0s would require total zeros to be at least 4, which is even less likely. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe a safer bid is to go with a higher digit but lower quantity? Wait no, the bid has to be higher than 3 0s. So either higher quantity (like 4 0s, 4 1s, etc.) or same quantity but higher digit (like 3 1s, 3 2s, etc.). \n\nWhat's the best play here? Since I have no zeros, challenging the bid would mean that I think the opponent doesn't have at least 3 zeros. Since they have 8 digits, getting 3 zeros is possible but maybe unlikely. But in Liar's Poker, players often bluff. Maybe the opponent is bluffing here. \n\nAlternatively, making a bid that's harder for them to counter. Let's see. If I challenge now, if they have 3 or more zeros, I lose. But if they have 2 or fewer, I win. The question is, is the opponent likely to have 3 zeros? Since each digit is random, the chance of 3 zeros in 8 digits is (8 choose 3)*(0.1)^3*(0.9)^5, which is low. The probability is low, so maybe challenging is a good move here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is just starting with a low bid. Let me think: the first bid was 3 0s. Maybe they think there are 3 zeros total, but since I have none, that's all their. But maybe that's a bluff. \n\nIf I challenge, if they have 3 zeros, I lose. But if I think they don't have that, then challenge. \n\nAlternatively, making a bid that's safer. Let's see, if I bid 3 1s. The total number of 1s would need to be at least 3. I have one 1 in my hand. So opponent's hand would need at least 2. Maybe possible, but maybe they don't have that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 4 8s. I have two 8s. So if I bid 4 8s, I'm claiming total is at least 4. The opponent has 8 digits. If they have two 8s, then total is 4. But I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to challenge now. Because 3 zeros in their hand is unlikely. Let me calculate: the probability of exactly 3 zeros in 8 digits is (8 choose 3)*(0.1)^3*(0.9)^5 \u2248 0.039. The probability of 3 or more zeros would be even lower. So the chance they have 3 or more is low. Therefore, challenging might be a good idea. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid something else. Let's see, maybe 3 1s. Let's see: my hand has one 1. So total would need at least 2 more from their hand. But maybe that's possible. However, if I bid 3 1s, then the opponent can either challenge or raise further. \n\nBut if I challenge now, and they have less than 3 zeros, I win. The risk is if they actually have 3 zeros. But given that the average is 0.8, getting 3 is very low. So challenging might be better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to set up a trap. But given the numbers, challenging seems better here. So I think I should challenge.\n"
