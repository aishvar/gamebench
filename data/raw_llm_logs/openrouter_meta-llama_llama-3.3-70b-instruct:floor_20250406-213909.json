        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '1 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since I don't have any 9s in my hand (76954023), increasing the quantity or digit seems necessary. Considering the digits I have, bidding on a digit I possess could be strategic. I have two 0s, but bidding on 0s might not be the best initial move since it's a low digit. However, I also have a 6 and other digits, but none higher than 6 or in greater quantity than two. Given the low current bid, a safe increase would be to bid on a higher digit with a low quantity or the same digit with a higher quantity. Since I don't have enough information about the opponent's hand and given that my hand doesn't strongly support a high bid on any specific digit, a cautious approach would be to slightly increase the bid while considering the potential for the opponent to have the digit they bid on. However, without a clear advantage in any digit, challenging might seem like an option, but given the bid is only 1 9s, it's quite possible the other player has at least one 9, making challenging risky. Thus, I should look for a digit in my hand that could reasonably appear in both hands and make a modest bid increase.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 0s\"\n}",
