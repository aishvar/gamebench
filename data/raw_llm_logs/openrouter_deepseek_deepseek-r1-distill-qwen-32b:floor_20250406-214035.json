        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '5 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, let's break down the situation in this Liar's Poker game. \n\nFirst, I have the hand digits: 7,6,2,4,7,9,6,8. I need to count how many 6s I have. Looking at my hand, I see two 6s. So, I have two 6s in my hand.\n\nThe current bid is 5 6s, made by Player 1. My previous bid was 4 6s, which was the starting point. Now, Player 1 has raised it to 5 6s. \n\nMy goal is to either make a higher bid or challenge the current bid. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or, if the quantity is the same, choose a higher digit. Since the current bid is 5 6s, to bid higher, I could either go for 6 6s or switch to a higher digit with the same or higher quantity.\n\nLooking at my hand again, I have two 6s. If I consider the possibility of how many 6s Player 1 might have, they could have up to 6 6s in their hand since they're bidding 5. But considering that each player has 8 digits, it's unlikely that Player 1 has 6 6s because that would leave only 2 other digits, which seems improbable. \n\nMoreover, the maximum possible quantity for any digit across both hands is 16. If Player 1 is bidding 5 6s, the total count could be anywhere from 5 to 16. However, since I only have two 6s, even if Player 1 has three 6s, the total would be five, which matches the current bid. But if Player 1 is lying, the total could be less than five.\n\nConsidering the risk, challenging the bid might be a good move. If I challenge and the total number of 6s is less than 5, I win. If it's 5 or more, Player 1 wins. Given that I have two 6s, it's possible that Player 1 has three, making the total exactly five. But it's also possible that Player 1 has fewer, especially since they might be trying to bluff.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to bid higher. The next possible bid would be either 6 6s or 5 7s. Since I have two 7s in my hand, bidding 5 7s might be a safer option because it's a higher digit, and maybe Player 1 doesn't have many 7s. However, I'm not sure about Player 1's hand, so this is speculative.\n\nBut considering the current state, challenging seems like a viable option because the current bid is 5 6s, and with only two in my hand, it's uncertain if Player 1 has enough to make the total five. Challenging could potentially lead to a win if the total is less than five.\n\nAnother angle is to think about the previous bids. I started with 4 6s, and Player 1 went up to 5. If I challenge now, I can test the validity of their bid. If they're bluffing, I can win. If not, I lose. Given that I have two 6s, the total could be five only if Player 1 has three. Otherwise, the total would be less.\n\nSo, weighing the options, challenging seems like a strategic move to either win the round or force Player 1 to reveal their hand if they're bluffing.\n"
