        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 3 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 24 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

The next possible bid could be 4 6s, which is a valid higher bid. However, I should first analyze the likelihood of the current bid being true. With 8 digits per player and 3 players, there are 24 digits in total. The current bid of 4 5s implies that at least 4 out of 24 digits are '5'. This is not extremely high, and it's possible. I have 1 '5', so the remaining 2 players must have at least 3 '5's between them. It's a bit tight but not impossible. I will take a cautious approach and bid higher, choosing a different digit that is more likely to be abundant. I see that I have multiple '2's. Bidding on '2's could be a safer option as I already have information about my hand. However, the current bid is on '5's, so I should bid higher than 4 5s. I can bid 4 6s or higher. I have 1 '6', so bidding 4 6s seems reasonable as it matches the quantity and increases the digit.\", \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"}",
