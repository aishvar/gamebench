        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.",

This is plausible.\n\n4. **Making a Decision**:\n   - To make a higher bid, you need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit.\n   - Increasing the quantity: Bidding 3 8s is a possibility. You know you have one 8, and it's plausible the other player has more than one 8. However, without strong evidence, significantly increasing the quantity might not be wise.\n   - Increasing the digit: You could bid 2 9s. You have one 9, so it's possible the total count of 9s is at least 2, considering the other player might also have a 9.\n\n5. **Choosing an Action**:\n   - Your hand has a good distribution but doesn't strongly support a very high bid on any particular digit.\n   - The current bid is 2 8s. You can bid 2 9s (since you have a 9, and it's a higher digit than 8), or you can bid 3 8s if you think the other player likely has more than one 8.\n   - Bidding 3 8s seems a bit aggressive without more information, but it's a reasonable step up.\n   - Bidding 2 9s is a safer increase in the bid because it changes the digit to a higher one without increasing the quantity, and you have one 9 in your hand.\n\n6. **Action Decision**:\n   - Let's choose to bid 2 9s. It's a reasonable bid because it increases the digit, and you have at least one 9.\n\nHere's the response in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 2 8s. I have one 8 and one 9 in my hand. Bidding 2 9s is a reasonable move as it increases the digit to a higher one without increasing the quantity. This seems like a safe and valid next bid given the information available.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 9s\"\n}\n```",
