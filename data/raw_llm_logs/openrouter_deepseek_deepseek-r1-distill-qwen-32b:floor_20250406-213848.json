        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 0s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, my hand is 05474458. That means I have the digits 0, 5, 4, 7, 4, 4, 5, 8. Let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\n- 0: 1\n- 5: 2\n- 4: 3\n- 7: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nSo, I have one 0, two 5s, three 4s, and single 7 and 8.\n\nNow, looking at the game state, the current bid is 3 0s made by Player 0. The bid history shows that Player 0 started with 2 1s, then Player 1 bid 2 5s, and now Player 0 has bid 3 0s.\n\nI need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid. Since the current bid is 3 0s, I have to think about the total number of 0s across both players. My hand has one 0, so the other player must have the rest. \n\nThe maximum possible quantity is 16, but realistically, since each player has 8 digits, the total number of 0s can't exceed 16. But given that Player 0 has already bid 3 0s, they might be trying to trick me into thinking there are more. \n\nI should consider the likelihood of there being 3 or more 0s. If I have one, the other player could have up to two more, making it three total. But if I challenge, and the actual count is less than 3, I would win. \n\nBut wait, since the current bid is 3 0s, if I challenge, and the total is less than 3, Player 0 loses. However, if I'm wrong, I lose. So I need to assess the risk.\n\nLooking at the bid history, Player 0 first bid 2 1s, then I bid 2 5s. Now they're going higher with 3 0s. It's possible they're trying to bluff, especially since 0s are lower digits and might be less likely to have high counts.\n\nAnother angle: Since I have two 5s, maybe I can bid higher on a different digit. But the current bid is 3 0s, so I have to either bid higher or challenge.\n\nIf I challenge, and the total number of 0s is exactly 3, Player 0 wins. If it's less, I win. But if I have one 0, and the other player has two, the total is three. So challenging might be risky because it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 5s, which would be higher than 3 0s because the digit is higher. But I only have two 5s. The other player might have some 5s, but I don't know. It's possible that the total number of 5s is higher than 3, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, I have two 5s. If the other player has one or two, the total could be three or four. Bidding 3 5s might be a good move, but I have to consider if that's a safe bid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 4 4s since I have three 4s. If the other player has one 4, the total would be four. Bidding 4 4s would be higher than 3 0s because the quantity is higher.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the other player's hand. They might have more 4s or not. It's a risk.\n\nHmm, maybe challenging is better here because 3 0s seems a bit high. If I have one, and the other player has two, it's exactly three. But if they have one or none, then the total is less. So challenging could be a calculated risk.\n\nI think I'll go with challenging because the bid of 3 0s seems a bit high, especially considering the previous bids were lower. It's possible that Player 0 is bluffing, and the actual count is lower.\n"
