        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

The current bid is \\'4 6s\\', meaning Player 0 claims there are at least 4 sixes between our hands. Looking at my hand (84730463), I have only 1 six. This means Player 0 would need to have at least 3 sixes in their hand for their bid to be true. While possible, this seems somewhat unlikely. I could challenge, but there\\'s still a reasonable chance they have 3 sixes. Alternatively, I could bid higher. My options are to bid 5 of any digit, or 4 of a digit higher than 6 (4 7s, 4 8s, or 4 9s). I have 1 seven, 1 eight, and 0 nines in my hand. Given that I have 2 zeros and 1 three in my hand, bidding \\'5 0s\\' or \\'5 3s\\' would require Player 0 to have 3 or 4 of those digits, which seems risky. I\\'ll bid \\'4 7s\\' since I have one 7 in my hand, and it\\'s a minimal increase over the current bid.\",\"action\":\"BID: 4 7s\"}', type='text')"
