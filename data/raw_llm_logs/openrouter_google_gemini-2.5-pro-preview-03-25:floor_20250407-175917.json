The current bid is '3 3s', meaning the bidder claims there are at least three 3s across all 16 digits (my 8 and their 8). Since I hold no 3s, the opponent must hold at least three 3s in their 8-digit hand for the bid to be true. The probability of having 3 or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is statistically low (P(X>=3) for Binomial(8, 0.1) is approx 3.8%). Given this low probability, challenging the bid is the most statistically advantageous move.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
