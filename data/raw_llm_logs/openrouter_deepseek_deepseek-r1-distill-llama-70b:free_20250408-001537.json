        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, let's see. I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. The current bid is None, so I need to make the first bid. My hand is 04114367. Hmm, let's break that down. \n\nSo my digits are 0, 4, 1, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7. Let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\n0 appears once, 1 appears twice, 3 once, 4 twice, 6 once, 7 once. So the digits I have multiple of are 1s and 4s. \n\nSince I have two 1s and two 4s, maybe I can bid on those. But since it's the first bid, I should probably start low to not overcommit. Bidding on 2 1s or 2 4s. \n\nLooking at the possible digits, 1 is a lower digit than 4, so maybe starting with 2 1s is safer. Alternatively, I could go for 2 4s, but I think starting with a lower digit might be better because higher digits are less common, so it's more likely to have fewer of them. \n\nWait, but if I bid 2 1s, and the other player has none, that's only two. But if I bid 2 4s, and the other player has more, it might be higher. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the maximum possible. Since there are 16 digits in total (each player has 8), the maximum any digit can have is 16. But that's not helpful for a first bid. \n\nSince I have two 1s, I can safely bid 2 1s. That's a good starting point because it's a low quantity and a low digit, making it easier to be correct. \n\nSo I think I'll bid 2 1s. It's a safe move that's hard to challenge because even if the other player has none, the total would be 2, which meets the bid. If they have more, it's even better. \n\nI don't want to bid too high on the first move because I don't know the opponent's hand. Starting with a low bid sets a foundation without risking an immediate challenge. \n\nYeah, I'll go with BID: 2 1s.\n"
