You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to make the first bid in this Liar's Poker game. My hand is 88103733. Let me count how many of each digit I have.\n\nBreaking down my hand: 8, 8, 1, 0, 3, 7, 3, 3. So, counts per digit:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 1\n- 3: 3\n- 7: 1\n- 8: 2\n\nSo the highest count in my hand is three 3s. But since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total digits in play are 16. The opponent has 8 digits I don't know. Since the current bid is None, I need to start with a bid that's reasonable but leaves room for the opponent to either bid higher or challenge.\n\nIf I start with a bid based on my highest count, which is three 3s, I can bid 3 3s. But since there's no previous bid, I can start lower. Wait, no\u2014the first bid can be any valid bid, but since the current bid is None, I can set the starting point. However, the first bid must be a quantity and digit, and the next player has to bid higher. So maybe starting with a moderate bid that I think is safe based on my own hand, considering that the opponent might have some of the same digits.\n\nAlternatively, starting with a lower quantity but higher digit might be strategic. For example, if I have two 8s, maybe bidding two 8s, but the opponent could have more. Hmm. Wait, the opponent has 8 digits. The maximum possible for any digit is 16 (if all 16 digits are the same), but that's impossible here. \n\nLooking at my hand, the 3s are three, which is the highest. So if I bid three 3s, that's based on my own hand. But the opponent could have 0-5 3s (since I have 3, and there are 8 digits left). So total possible 3s could be anywhere from 3 to 8 (if the opponent has all 8 as 3s, which is unlikely). But that's possible. But since the opponent's hand is unknown, maybe starting with a bid that's a bit conservative but plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bid a lower quantity but higher digit. For example, two 8s. Since I have two 8s, maybe the opponent has one or two, making the total 3 or 4. But if I bid two 8s, the next player could bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. Since 8 is the highest digit, they can't go higher in digit, so they'd have to increase the quantity. But starting with two 8s might be a good move because 8 is a high digit, and if the opponent has any 8s, the total could be higher. However, if they don't, the total is just my two, so if I bid two 8s, and the opponent challenges, they'd lose. But since it's the first bid, maybe it's better to start with a lower quantity but a digit that's more likely to be present.\n\nAlternatively, considering the total possible digits. The most common digit in a standard deck (if this were a real deck) might be 0s or 1s, but here it's just random digits. So maybe the safest first bid is based on my own highest count. Since I have three 3s, bidding three 3s. Then the opponent has to either bid higher quantity (like four of any digit) or same quantity but higher digit (like three 4s, 5s, etc.). If they bid higher quantity, like four 3s, then I can assess based on my three. If they bid three 4s, I can challenge if I have none, but I have a 0,1,7,8, so maybe not. Alternatively, they might have their own 4s. \n\nBut since the opponent's hand is unknown, starting with three 3s is a reasonable first bid. It's based on my own hand, and gives me a foundation. Alternatively, starting with a lower bid to feel out the opponent. For example, two 8s. Since I have two, maybe the opponent has one, making three total. But if I bid two 8s, the opponent could challenge. If they have none, then the total is two, so I win. But if they have even one, then the bid is valid. But since I have two, the minimum total is two, and the maximum possible is 10 (if they have 8 8s, but that's impossible because they have 8 digits). Wait, opponent has 8 digits, so the maximum number of 8s they could have is 8, making total 10 (my 2 + their 8). So if I bid two 8s, and the opponent has, say, one 8, the total is three, which meets the bid. So challenging would be bad for them. So they might not challenge. But if they have none, they might challenge. But since I have two, the total is at least two, so my bid of two 8s is exactly the minimum. But in Liar's Poker, the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So if I bid two 8s, and the total is exactly two, then the bid is valid. So challenging would make the challenger lose. Therefore, if I bid two 8s, the opponent can't challenge successfully unless the total is less than two, which it can't be. Therefore, bidding two 8s is a safe bid. But then the opponent can bid higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, three 3s is quantity 3, digit 3. If I bid three 3s, the opponent can bid three 4s, or four of any digit. But since 3 is a lower digit, they could go higher. So maybe starting with a higher digit is better. Wait, the bid must be strictly higher than the previous bid. Since the current bid is None, the first bid can be anything. So perhaps the best strategy is to start with a bid that's likely to be true but not too high, to avoid being challenged immediately. \n\nLooking at my hand again: I have three 3s, two 8s, one 0, one 1, one 7. If I bid three 3s, that's based on my own hand. The opponent's hand could have 0-5 3s (since they have 8 digits). So the total 3s could be 3-8. So if I bid three 3s, the actual total is at least three. Therefore, the bid is safe. The opponent can't challenge successfully because even if they have none, I have three, so the total is three, which meets the bid. So bidding three 3s is a safe opening move. The opponent then has to bid higher. They might bid four of something, or three of a higher digit. For example, if they have a higher digit in their hand, they could bid three 4s, which would be a higher bid. But I can't know. \n\nAlternatively, if I start with a higher digit, like three 8s. But I only have two 8s. The opponent could have up to 8, so total could be 10. But if I bid three 8s, that's a bid of three, which is higher than the current None. But since the opponent has 8 digits, they could have one 8, making total three. So the bid would be valid. But if they have none, then the total is two, which is less than three, so if they challenge, I lose. But since I have two, the total could be two. So bidding three 8s is risky because if the opponent has none, the total is two, and they can challenge and win. So that's a bad move. \n\nSo safer to bid three 3s, which is guaranteed to be at least three. Because I have three, so even if the opponent has none, the total is three. Therefore, the bid is valid. So that's a safe opening. Then the opponent has to bid higher. So I should bid three 3s.\n"
