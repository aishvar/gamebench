You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me break down the situation step by step. \n\nFirst, let's look at the game state. My hand is 86033456. That means I have the digits 8, 6, 0, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, I have two 6s, two 3s, and one each of 8, 0, 4, and 5. \n\nThe current bid is 3 2s, made by Player 1. The bid history shows that I started with a bid of 2 6s, and then Player 1 upped it to 3 2s. Now it's my turn again. \n\nI need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. To challenge, I have to think if 3 2s is a plausible bid. But I don't have any 2s in my hand, so I don't know how many the opponent has. However, since the total number of digits is 16 (8 each), the maximum any digit can have is 16, but that's extremely rare. \n\nIf I make a higher bid, I have to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the current bid is 3 2s, I can either bid 4 of a higher digit or the same digit with a higher quantity. But I don't have enough of any digit to safely bid higher. For example, I have two 6s, but that's not enough to bid 4 6s. Similarly, I have two 3s, but that's not enough for 4 3s either. \n\nConsidering that, maybe challenging is the better option. The opponent might be bluffing because 3 2s is a bit specific, and without knowing their hand, it's risky. But wait, if I challenge and the total 2s are indeed 3 or more, I lose. If it's less, I win. Since I have zero 2s, the opponent could have up to 3, but it's possible they have fewer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can make a bid that's higher but still within my means. For instance, since I have two 6s, I could try to bid 3 6s. That would be a higher bid than 3 2s because 6 is higher than 2. But wait, the current bid is 3 2s, so to bid higher, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. So, 3 6s is a valid higher bid because 6 > 2. \n\nLet me check: my hand has two 6s. If I bid 3 6s, the total number of 6s in both hands needs to be at least 3. Since I have two, the opponent must have at least one for the bid to hold. If the opponent has one, that makes three, which satisfies the bid. If they have none, then the bid fails. But I don't know their hand. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 4 of a lower digit, but I don't have enough of any digit to make 4. So, maybe 3 6s is a safer bet because I have two, and the opponent might have at least one. \n\nWait, but if I bid 3 6s and the opponent challenges, I could lose if they have zero 6s. But if I make the bid, the opponent might decide to challenge or raise. Hmm, this is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, if I challenge the 3 2s bid, and if the total is less than 3, I win. But if it's 3 or more, I lose. Since I don't have any 2s, the opponent could have all 3, but that's possible. \n\nI think making a bid of 3 6s is a better move because it's a higher bid and I have some basis for it with my two 6s. It's a calculated risk, but it keeps the game going and puts pressure on the opponent. Plus, it's a valid higher bid, so it's strategically better than challenging without knowing their hand.\n"
