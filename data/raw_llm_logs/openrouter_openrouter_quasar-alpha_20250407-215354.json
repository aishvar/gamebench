Since I hold half of the digits and see no 6s, the entire 16-digit pool would need to have both sixes in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely given the distribution. Additionally, I can raise the bid if I have a strong case with other digits. In my hand, I have two 4s and two 0s, which suggests that higher bids on 4s or 0s might be safer options. Since the original bid was 2 4s, I can safely increase to 3 4s, leveraging my two 4s and hoping Player 1 has at least one. This is a reasonable and strategic escalation.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 4\"\n}",
