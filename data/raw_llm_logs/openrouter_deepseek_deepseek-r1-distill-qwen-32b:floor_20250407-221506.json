You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the rules: each player has 8 secret digits, and we take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit across both hands. The bid has to be higher than the previous one, either in quantity or digit. If I can't make a higher bid, I can challenge the last bid.\n\nRight now, it's my turn, and the current bid is None, which means it's the first move. I need to make the initial bid. The goal is to make a bid that's likely to be true but also gives me an advantage.\n\nLooking at my hand: 01795063. Let me list out the digits I have:\n\n0,1,7,9,5,0,6,3.\n\nSo, let's count how many of each digit I have:\n\n- 0: appears twice\n- 1: once\n- 3: once\n- 5: once\n- 6: once\n- 7: once\n- 9: once\n\nOther digits (2,4,8) don't appear in my hand.\n\nSince I'm starting, I need to choose a digit and a quantity to bid on. The bid must be higher than None, so I can choose any digit and any quantity, but it's better to start with a low quantity to make it more believable.\n\nI should consider which digits might have higher counts in the opponent's hand. Maybe digits that are less common, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can bid on a digit I have a few of to increase the chances.\n\nI have two 0s. Maybe I can bid on 0s. If I bid 2 0s, that's a safe starting point because I have two, but the opponent might have some too. However, I don't know their hand, so it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a different digit. Let's see, I have one 1, but that's low. Maybe I can bid on 3 0s. Wait, no, I only have two, so that's risky. Maybe I should bid on a higher digit to make it more tempting for the opponent to challenge.\n\nWait, the opponent might have some 0s too. The total possible is 16 digits, so the maximum count for any digit is 16. But with only two players, each has 8 digits, so the total for a digit can't exceed 16.\n\nIf I bid 3 0s, that's possible because I have two, and the opponent might have one. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should start lower.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I don't have much, like 3 1s. But I only have one 1, so that's risky.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about which digits are less likely to be in the opponent's hand. If I have two 0s, maybe the opponent also has some 0s. Or maybe they don't. It's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit, like 5s. I have one 5. If I bid 2 5s, that's possible. Or maybe 3 5s.\n\nWait, but I'm starting, so I can choose any bid. Maybe I should choose a digit that I have a couple of, to make the bid more likely.\n\nSo, I have two 0s. Maybe I can bid 2 0s. That's a safe starting point. It's low, so the opponent can easily bid higher, but it's a good way to start.\n\nWait, but in the example, when the current bid is None, the first player can choose any bid. So, I can choose any quantity and digit. Maybe I should choose a digit that's less likely to be high, but I don't have much info.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I have, like 0s, to make it more likely. So, I have two 0s, so if I bid 2 0s, that's a good starting point. The opponent might have some 0s too, making the total higher.\n\nWait, but if I bid 2 0s, the opponent could easily bid higher, like 3 0s, and so on. Maybe I should start with a higher bid to limit their options.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit, like 3 5s, because I have one 5, and maybe the opponent has two, making the total 3. But that's speculative.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. Since I'm starting, I can choose any bid. Maybe I should choose a digit that I have a couple of, to make it more likely that the total is higher.\n\nI have two 0s. If I bid 3 0s, that's possible because the opponent might have one. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I could bid 2 0s, which is safer.\n\nWait, but the bid has to be higher than None, so any bid is acceptable. Maybe I should choose a digit that's less likely to be in the opponent's hand, but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I don't have, but that's risky because if the opponent has none, the bid would be too low.\n\nWait, maybe I should bid on a digit that's in the middle, like 5s or 6s, which I have one each.\n\nIf I bid 2 5s, that's possible because I have one, and the opponent might have one. Alternatively, I could bid 2 6s for the same reason.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should start with a lower bid to make it more tempting for the opponent to challenge.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit, like 3 7s, but I only have one 7, so that's risky.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the opponent's possible moves. If I bid 2 0s, the opponent can easily bid higher, like 3 0s, and so on. Maybe I should start with a higher bid to make it harder for them.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit that's less likely to be high, like 8s or 9s, which I don't have much of.\n\nWait, I have a 9 in my hand. Maybe I can bid 2 9s. That's possible because I have one, and the opponent might have one.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should choose a digit that's more common, like 0s or 1s.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 3 0s, assuming the opponent has one. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should start with a bid that's just slightly higher than what I have, to make it more believable.\n\nI have two 0s. Maybe I can bid 3 0s. That's possible because the opponent might have one. But if they don't, then the total would be two, making my bid invalid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 0s, which is safer because I have two, and the opponent might have some.\n\nWait, but the bid has to be higher than None, so I can choose any. Maybe I should bid 2 0s because it's a safe starting point.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit, like 3 5s, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the opponent's possible hand. Since I don't know, I should make a bid that's likely to be true based on my hand.\n\nI have two 0s. So, if I bid 2 0s, that's a good starting point because it's based on my hand. The opponent might have some 0s, making the total higher.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I have one of, like 5s or 6s, but that's riskier.\n\nWait, but if I bid 2 0s, the opponent can easily bid higher, like 3 0s, and so on. Maybe I should start with a higher bid to make it harder for them.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit that's less likely to be in the opponent's hand, but I don't know.\n\nHmm, I'm still not sure. Maybe I should go with a bid based on my hand. I have two 0s, so I can bid 2 0s. That's a safe starting point.\n\nBut wait, the opponent might have none, making the total two, which would make my bid valid. So, it's a good starting point.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 0s, assuming the opponent has one. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should bid 2 0s because it's based on my hand, and it's a low bid, making it easier for the opponent to challenge if they think it's too low.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should choose a higher digit to make it more tempting.\n\nWait, I have a 9 in my hand. Maybe I can bid 2 9s. That's possible because I have one, and the opponent might have one.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should choose a digit that's more common.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 3 5s, but I have only one 5.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the maximum possible. The total for any digit can't exceed 16, but with two players, it's 8 each maximum.\n\nWait, no, each player has 8 digits, so the total for any digit can be up to 16, but in reality, it's unlikely to have that many.\n\nSo, if I bid 2 0s, the total could be up to 16, but it's more likely to be lower.\n\nHmm, I'm still stuck. Maybe I should just make a bid based on my hand. I have two 0s, so I can bid 2 0s. That's a safe starting point.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit, like 3 5s, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the opponent might have a higher count for a digit. So, if I bid 2 0s, the opponent can easily bid higher.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit that's less likely to be high, like 8s or 9s, but I don't have many.\n\nWait, I have a 9, so maybe I can bid 2 9s. That's possible, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 3 0s, assuming the opponent has one.\n\nWait, maybe I should just go with 2 0s because it's based on my hand, and it's a low bid, making it easier for the opponent to challenge if they think it's too low.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should choose a higher bid to make it harder for the opponent.\n\nWait, perhaps I should bid 3 0s. That's possible because I have two, and the opponent might have one. But if they don't, then the total is two, making my bid invalid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 0s, which is safer.\n\nHmm, I think I'll go with 3 0s. It's a bit risky, but it's based on my hand plus an assumption about the opponent's hand.\n\nWait, but I only have two 0s. If the opponent has none, the total is two, making my bid of 3 invalid. So, that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 0s, which is safer because I have two, and the opponent might have some.\n\nYes, I think I'll go with 2 0s. It's a safe starting point, and it's based on my hand.\n"
