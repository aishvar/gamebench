        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 3 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 24 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Given that there are 3 players and each has 8 digits, the total number of digits is 24. The bid of 3 9s implies that there are at least three 9s across all hands. Since I have no 9s, the other two players must have at least three 9s between them. This is possible but seems unlikely as it would mean they have a significant portion of the total 9s. I have a 6, which is higher than the digit 5 but lower than 9. I can bid higher than 3 9s by bidding a higher quantity. Bidding 4 0s or any other low digit might be too conservative, but it's a safer option. I can also consider challenging, but given that it's the first bid and there's still a lot of uncertainty, I might try to bid higher. Bidding 4 9s seems too aggressive as it implies a very high number of 9s. A more reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity but with a lower digit or the same digit if I had it. Since I don't have a 9, I'll consider a different digit. I can bid 3 0s or higher, but my hand doesn't support a high confidence in any digit being abundant enough to make a significantly higher bid than 3 9s. However, bidding 4 5s is plausible because I have three 5s, and it's a relatively safe increase in quantity. It's also a more reasonable bid than challenging the current bid directly.\", \"action\": \"BID: 4 5s\"}",
