This is the lowest possible quantity bid on the lowest digit, making it a very weak opening. My hand is 79985132, which contains zero 0s. While I don't have any 0s, challenging this early, low bid is risky. Player 0 only needs two 0s in their 8-digit hand for the bid to be true, which is plausible. Therefore, making a higher bid is the safer option. I need to bid higher than '2 0s', meaning either a higher quantity of 0s (e.g., '3 0s') or the same quantity (2) of a higher digit (1-9). Looking at my hand, I have two 9s. Bidding '2 9s' is a safe and valid higher bid because the quantity (2) is the same as the current bid, but the digit (9) is higher than 0. Furthermore, this bid is guaranteed to be true based solely on my own hand, regardless of what Player 0 holds. This makes it a strong, low-risk move.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 9s\"\n}\n```",
