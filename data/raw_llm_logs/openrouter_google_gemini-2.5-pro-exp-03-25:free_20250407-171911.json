I have two 3s and two 7s, which is slightly more than the average. As this is the first bid, I should make a plausible opening bid based on my hand. Bidding '2 Threes' or '2 Sevens' would be very safe as I hold two of each. However, a slightly more standard opening bid is to claim one more than I hold of my most frequent digits. Bidding '3 Threes' requires my opponent to have at least one 3 among their 8 digits, which is reasonably probable (roughly 57% chance assuming random distribution). This bid leverages my hand's strength in 3s and starts the bidding at a level that requires a response.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 3\"\n}\n```",
