For the current bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) needs to have at least one '8'. This is statistically quite likely (8 digits for the opponent). Challenging feels too risky this early, as '2 8s' is a low and plausible bid. I need to make a higher bid. I have two '2's in my hand. Bidding '3 2s' is a valid higher bid (quantity increases from 2 to 3). This bid leverages my hand strength, as I already possess two of the required three '2's. It only requires the opponent to have one '2', which is statistically plausible. Other bids like '2 9s' (requiring two '9's from the opponent) or '3 8s' (requiring two '8's from the opponent) seem riskier.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 2s\"\n}\n```",
