        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, I have the hand \"86033456\". That means my digits are 8, 6, 0, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\nLooking at my digits: \n- 0: 1\n- 3: 2\n- 4: 1\n- 5: 1\n- 6: 2\n- 8: 1\n\nThe other player has 8 digits as well, but I don't know what they are. The current bid is None, so I have to make the first bid. \n\nSince it's the first bid, I can choose any digit and any quantity. But I want to make a bid that's likely to be true but not too high, so I don't get challenged. \n\nLooking at my digits, I have two 3s, two 6s, and one each of 0,4,5,8. So maybe I can bid on a digit I have multiple of. \n\nIf I bid on 3s, I have two. So I could bid 2 3s. But maybe I can go higher. Since the other player might have more, maybe the total could be 3 or 4. But if I bid 3 3s and the other player has one, that would make four, which is higher than my bid. Wait, no, the bid is the minimum. So if I bid 3 3s, the total needs to be at least 3. If I have two, and the other player has one, that's three, which meets the bid. If the other player has two, that's four, which is still good. But if the other player has none, then the total is two, which is less than my bid, and I lose. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 3s. That's safer because even if the other player has none, I still have two. So maybe that's a better option. \n\nBut wait, maybe I can choose a higher digit. For example, I have two 6s. The other player might have more 6s. If I bid 2 6s, it's possible. Or even 3 6s if I think the other player has at least one. \n\nBut considering the other player's possible digits, it's hard to tell. Maybe starting with a lower quantity is safer. \n\nAnother approach is to look for digits that are less likely to be abundant. For example, 0s are less common, so if I have one, the other player might have none. So bidding on 0s might be risky. \n\nSo, considering all this, maybe I should bid 2 3s or 2 6s. Between the two, 3s are lower digits, so maybe it's better to bid a higher digit to have the option of increasing the digit in future bids. \n\nSo, if I bid 2 6s, that's a solid bid because I have two, and the other player might have more. Alternatively, I could bid 3 6s if I think the other player has at least one. But that's a bit risky. \n\nAlternatively, I could look at the highest digit I have, which is 8. I have one 8. If I bid 1 8s, that's safe because the total is at least one. But maybe I can go higher. If the other player has another 8, then the total is two, which would make my bid of 1 safe. But if I bid 2 8s and the other player has none, then I lose. \n\nHmm, so maybe starting with a lower bid is better. Let me think about the possible bids. \n\nIf I bid 2 3s, that's a safe bet because I have two, and the other player could have zero, making the total two, which meets the bid. If the other player has one or more, it's even better. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 6s, which is also safe for the same reason. \n\nBetween 3s and 6s, 6s are higher, so if I bid 2 6s, it's a higher digit, which might be better for future bids. \n\nSo, I think I'll go with bidding 2 6s. That way, I have a solid foundation, and it's a reasonable starting point.\n"
