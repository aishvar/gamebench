        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 2s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

The current bid is 3 2s, which seems plausible but not extremely high. Considering I have digits like 6 and 9, which are higher than 2, and given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, bidding a higher quantity of a lower digit or the same quantity of a higher digit could be strategic. However, since I only have one 2 and no information about the other player's hand, challenging the current bid might not be the best move unless I have a strong reason to believe it's false. Given my hand and the goal to make a strictly higher bid, I could consider bidding on a digit I have multiple of, but since the bid needs to be strictly higher, I must either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Bidding on a digit I have, like 6 or 9, with a quantity of 3 or more could be risky without knowing the other player's hand. Thus, a safer approach might be to slightly increase the quantity of a digit that is not too high, considering the balance between risking a challenge and making a believable bid. However, given the rules and my hand, a straightforward strategy would be to bid on a digit that I think could plausibly occur more than the current bid, taking into account the total possible occurrences across both hands.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 2s\"\n}",
