        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let's see, I have the hand 44039770. That means my digits are 4, 4, 0, 3, 9, 7, 7, 0. So I have two 4s, two 7s, two 0s, and one each of 3, 9. \n\nThe current bid is 2 8s from Player 0. I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge. \n\nFirst, I should think about the possible counts of 8s. Since each player has 8 digits, the total across both hands is 16. If the bid is 2 8s, that means Player 0 is claiming there are at least two 8s in total. \n\nLooking at my hand, I don't have any 8s. So the only possible 8s are in Player 0's hand. If they have two 8s, that would make the total 2. If they have one, then the total is 1, which would make their bid invalid. \n\nBut wait, the bid is 2 8s. So if I challenge, we'll count all the 8s. If there are less than 2, I win. If there are 2 or more, Player 0 wins. \n\nI don't have any 8s, so the count depends on Player 0's hand. If they have two 8s, they're correct. If they have one or none, I can win by challenging. \n\nIs it likely that Player 0 has two 8s? I don't know their hand, but the bid seems a bit high. Maybe they're bluffing. If I challenge, I might be able to catch them in a lie. \n\nAlternatively, I could make a higher bid. The current bid is 2 8s. To bid higher, I could either increase the quantity or the digit. For example, 3 8s would be higher in quantity, or 2 9s would be higher in digit. \n\nLooking at my hand, do I have any digits that could support a higher bid? I have two 4s, two 7s, two 0s. If I bid 3 4s, that would mean there are at least three 4s in total. But I only have two, so unless Player 0 has one, it's risky. Similarly, for 7s or 0s. \n\nMaybe I could bid 2 9s. Since I have a 9, if Player 0 has one, that would make two. But again, it's a bit of a guess. \n\nBut considering the current bid is 2 8s, and I don't have any 8s, challenging might be the better move. It's a high bid, and with only 16 total digits, it's possible that there aren't enough 8s. \n\nI think I'll go with challenging. It seems like a good risk, especially since I don't have any 8s to support their claim.\n"
