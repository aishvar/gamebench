You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. It's my turn, and the current bid is None, which means I have to make the first bid. My hand is 74291022. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at my own digits. Let's list them out: 7, 4, 2, 9, 1, 0, 2, 2. So, I have two 2s, one each of 7, 4, 9, 1, 0. That gives me some information about what digits are present. \n\nSince the current bid is None, I can start by bidding anything. I want to make a bid that's reasonable but not too high, so I don't get caught in a lie. Let me think about which digits I have multiple of. I have two 2s, which is the highest count in my hand. So maybe I can bid on 2s.\n\nHow many 2s could there be in total? Well, I have two, and the other player has eight digits. The maximum possible is 16, but for 2s, the other player could have up to eight more, but that's unlikely. So if I bid on 2s, maybe I can say 3 2s. That's one more than I have, assuming the opponent has at least one. But is that a good idea?\n\nAlternatively, I could look at digits I don't have and try to bid on those, but that seems riskier because I don't know if the opponent has them. It's safer to bid on a digit I have at least one of.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the opponent's possible moves. If I bid too high, they might challenge me. But since I'm the first to bid, I have the advantage of setting the tone. \n\nLet me think about possible quantities. The minimum I can bid is 1, but that's too low. Maybe 2 2s, since I have two. But I could also go higher. If I bid 3 2s, that gives me some room. If the opponent has at least one 2, then the total would be 3 or more. \n\nWait, but if I bid 3 2s and the opponent has none, then I lose. So I need to assess the likelihood. Since I have two, and the opponent has eight digits, the chance they have at least one 2 is decent. Maybe 3 is a safe bet.\n\nAlternatively, I could choose a digit I have only one of and bid 1 on that. For example, 1 7s. But that seems too low, and the opponent could easily challenge it if they don't have any 7s.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think bidding 3 2s is a good move. It's based on my hand, and it's a moderate bid that's not too high but shows confidence.\n"
