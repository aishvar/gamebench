You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nThe game is between two players, each with 8 secret digits. My hand is 61075304. Since I'm Player 0, it's my turn to make the first bid because the current bid is None. The goal is to either make a valid higher bid or challenge the last bid. But since there's no previous bid, I can only make a bid.\n\nFirst, I should look at my own hand to see what digits I have. My hand is 6, 1, 0, 7, 5, 0, 3, 0. Wait, no, let me count that again. 6,1,0,7,5,3,0,4. So the digits are 0,0,0,1,3,4,5,6,7. Wait, no, that's 8 digits: 6,1,0,7,5,3,0,4. So digits are 0,0,0,1,3,4,5,6,7? No, wait, 8 digits: 6,1,0,7,5,3,0,4. So the digits are 0,0,0,1,3,4,5,6,7? Wait, that's 9 digits, but I only have 8. Let me recount: 6,1,0,7,5,3,0,4. So that's two 0s? Wait, no, looking again: 6,1,0,7,5,3,0,4. So 0 appears twice? Or three times? Wait, 6,1,0,7,5,3,0,4: that's 8 digits. So 0 appears twice. Or am I miscounting?\n\nWait, 6,1,0,7,5,3,0,4: that's 8 digits. So 0 appears twice. So my digits are 0,0,1,3,4,5,6,7. Wait, that's 8 digits. So I have two 0s, and one each of 1,3,4,5,6,7. \n\nWait, but 6,1,0,7,5,3,0,4: that's 6,1,0,7,5,3,0,4. So 0 appears three times? Because I see three 0s: positions 3, 7, and maybe another? Wait, 6,1,0,7,5,3,0,4: the third digit is 0, the seventh digit is 0. So that's two 0s. So I have two 0s, and one each of 1,3,4,5,6,7. So total of 8 digits.\n\nNow, considering that each player has 8 digits, the total number of each digit in the game is between 0 and 16. Since I have two 0s, the opponent could have between 0 and 14 0s, but realistically, it's unlikely to have that many. \n\nSince it's the first bid, I can set the initial bid. I want to make a bid that's reasonable but not too high, so I don't get challenged. Looking at my hand, I have two 0s, so maybe I can bid on 0s. Alternatively, I could bid on another digit I have, like 1,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nBut since 0 is a common digit, it's possible that the opponent might have a few as well. So if I bid on 0s, I can get a higher chance of winning. Alternatively, I could bid on a higher digit to set the bar higher.\n\nWait, but I have two 0s. If I bid 2 0s, that's a safe bet because I know I have two, and the opponent might have more. But maybe I can bid higher. Alternatively, I could bid on a higher digit that I have only one of, but that might be riskier.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for the highest digit I have and bid on that. My highest digit is 7. I have one 7. So if I bid 1 7s, that's a low bid, but maybe too low. Alternatively, I could bid 2 7s, but I only have one, so that's risky because the opponent might not have any.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 6s, which I have one of. Bidding 1 6s is possible, but again, it's low. Maybe I should focus on a digit I have multiple of, like 0s.\n\nSo, considering that, I could bid 2 0s. But wait, the initial bid can be any quantity and digit, but since there's no prior bid, I can set it to whatever I want. So maybe I can bid higher than 2, but I don't want to overbid because the opponent might challenge.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 0s. Since I have two, and if the opponent has at least one, that would make three. That's a possibility. Or maybe 4 0s if I think the opponent has two.\n\nBut I don't know the opponent's hand. So perhaps a safer approach is to bid 2 0s. That way, even if the opponent has zero, I still have two, so the total is two, which meets the bid. Wait, no: the bid is the total across both players. So if I bid 2 0s, and I have two, the opponent could have zero, making the total exactly two. So that's safe. But if the opponent has more, it's even better.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid higher, like 3 0s, hoping that the opponent has at least one. But if the opponent has none, then the total is two, which is less than three, and if someone challenges, I would lose.\n\nSo maybe 2 0s is a safe starting bid. Alternatively, I could bid on another digit, but 0 seems more likely to have multiple.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 5s. I have one 5. So if I bid 1 5s, that's safe because I have one, but it's a low bid. The next player could easily overbid.\n\nWait, but since it's the first bid, I can set it to whatever I want. So perhaps I can bid on a higher digit with a higher quantity. For example, if I bid 3 5s, but I only have one. So the opponent would need to have two more for the total to be three. That's possible, but not certain.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 6s. I have one 6. So if I bid 1 6s, that's safe, but again, a low bid.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that the opponent might have more of a certain digit. But without knowing, it's hard.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the highest digit I can bid with some confidence. Since I have a 7, which is a high digit, but only one. So if I bid 1 7s, that's safe, but maybe too low. Alternatively, I could bid 2 7s, but that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 0s with a higher quantity, like 4 0s. I have two, so the opponent would need two more. That's possible, but again, not certain.\n\nBut since it's the first bid, I want to set a bid that's not too high to avoid being challenged, but also not too low that the opponent can easily overbid.\n\nWait, but in the first bid, the opponent can't challenge because there's no previous bid. So I can set any bid I want. So perhaps I should start with a moderate bid.\n\nAlternatively, I could start with a bid that's likely to be safe. Since I have two 0s, bidding 2 0s is safe because I know I have two. So the total will be at least two, which meets the bid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 0s, hoping the opponent has at least one. But if they have none, I lose.\n\nSo perhaps the safest bet is to bid 2 0s. That way, I'm certain to have at least that number, and the opponent can't challenge the first bid. Wait, no, the opponent can't challenge until after I make the bid. So if I bid 2 0s, the opponent can then challenge or overbid.\n\nWait, no, the first bid is mine. So I make the bid, then the opponent can either challenge or make a higher bid.\n\nSo if I bid 2 0s, the opponent could challenge, thinking that maybe the total is less than two. But I know I have two, so the total can't be less than two. Therefore, if the opponent challenges, I would win because the total is at least two.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent could overbid, perhaps bidding 3 0s or higher.\n\nBut since I'm starting, I can choose any bid. So perhaps I should choose a bid that's both safe and gives me an advantage.\n\nAnother consideration: the maximum quantity is 16, but that's per digit. So for 0s, the max is 16, but in reality, each player has 8 digits, so the max for any digit is 16.\n\nBut in my hand, I have two 0s. So the opponent could have up to 14 0s, but that's extremely unlikely.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think bidding 2 0s is a safe and reasonable starting bid. It's based on my hand, and it's a low enough bid that the opponent might not want to challenge immediately, but it's also a solid foundation.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit, but I don't have enough of them to make a higher bid safely. So 2 0s seems like the best option.\n"
