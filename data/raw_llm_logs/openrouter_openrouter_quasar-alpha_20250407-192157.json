Therefore, for the bid of 2 8s to be valid, the opponent must have at least one '8'. Since it's quite common to have at least one '8' in 8 digits, the bid is plausible. Challenging now is risky. To raise, I can either increase the count to 3 of any digit or bid 2 of a higher digit (9). I have two '6's, so a safe incremental bid would be 3 6s, leveraging the two I hold and hoping the opponent has at least one. This is a reasonable and safe advance over the current bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 6s\"\n}",
