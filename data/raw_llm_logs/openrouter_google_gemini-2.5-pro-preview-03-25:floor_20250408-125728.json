        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

The current bid is 4 9s, meaning Player 0 claims there are at least four 9s in total across both hands (16 digits). For this to be true, Player 0 must hold at least three 9s in their 8-digit hand. Player 0 has escalated bids on 9s (2 9s -> 3 9s -> 4 9s), indicating they likely hold at least two 9s. However, requiring three specific digits in an 8-digit hand is statistically improbable, making it more likely they hold two 9s and are bluffing the fourth 9. Making a higher bid, such as 5 8s (based on my two 8s), seems risky as Player 0 previously ignored my 4 8s bid by bidding 4 9s, suggesting they may not hold many 8s or are very confident in their 9s. Given the unlikelihood of Player 0 holding three 9s compared to the possibility of a bluff based on holding two 9s, challenging is the most prudent action.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
