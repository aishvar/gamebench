You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, the game is just starting because the current bid is 'None' and there's no bid history. That means I'm the first to make a bid. My hand is '63127470'. Let me list out the digits I have: 6, 3, 1, 2, 7, 4, 7, 0. So, I have two 7s, and the rest are single digits.\n\nSince it's the first bid, I can choose any quantity and digit. I need to make a bid that's reasonable but also gives me a strategic advantage. Bidding too high might make the opponent challenge, but too low might not be effective.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 7s. So, if I bid on 7s, I can be somewhat confident. I can bid '2 7s' because I have exactly two. But maybe I can go a bit higher to set a stronger foundation. If I bid '3 7s', it's possible that the opponent might have one 7 as well, which would make the total three. However, if they don't, I might lose the challenge.\n\nAlternatively, I could choose a different digit where I have a single instance. For example, I have one 6. If I bid '1 6s', it's a low bid, but it's safe. However, it doesn't put much pressure on the opponent. The same applies to other digits like 3, 1, 2, 4, or 0.\n\nConsidering the options, bidding '2 7s' seems safe because I know I have two. It's a moderate bid that doesn't overcommit. If the opponent challenges, I can reveal that there are at least two 7s. If they don't challenge, they might think I have more, which could influence their future bids.\n\nI should also think about the possible maximum. Since there are 16 digits in total (each player has 8), the maximum any digit can have is 16. But that's extremely rare. So, starting with a bid that's plausible is better.\n\nAnother thought: if I bid '2 7s', the opponent might decide to challenge if they don't have any 7s, thinking that the total is less than two. But since I have two, the challenge would fail, and I would win. Alternatively, if they have one 7, the total would be three, which is still higher than my bid, so I would still win.\n\nWait, no. If I bid '2 7s' and the total is exactly two, then the bid is exactly met, so I would win. If the total is more, I still win. If it's less, the challenger wins. But since I have two, the minimum total is two (if the opponent has none), so the bid would be valid. Therefore, challenging my bid would be risky for them because they can't be sure if I have more.\n\nSo, 'BID: 2 7s' seems like a solid opening move. It's based on my hand, and it's a bid that I can confidently back if challenged. It also doesn't reveal too much about my other digits, keeping the opponent uncertain.\n"
