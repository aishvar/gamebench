        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let's see, my hand is 89301336. So, let me break that down: the digits I have are 8, 9, 3, 0, 1, 3, 3, 6. Hmm, so I have three 3s, one each of 8, 9, 0, 1, and 6. \n\nThe current bid is 3 5s from Player 0. I'm Player 1, and it's my turn. I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. \n\nFirst, let's think about the 5s. The bid is that there are at least three 5s in total between both players. But looking at my hand, I don't have any 5s. So, if I challenge, I'm hoping that the total number of 5s is less than three. But I don't know how many 5s Player 0 has. Since they bid 3 5s, maybe they have some, but maybe not enough. \n\nAlternatively, I could try to make a higher bid. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the current bid is 3 5s, I could bid 3 6s, which is a higher digit, or 4 of any digit, but the digit has to be higher than 5 if I keep the quantity the same.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have three 3s. So, I could potentially bid 3 3s, but that's lower than 5s, so it's not a valid higher bid. I have one 6, which is higher than 5. So, if I bid 3 6s, that would be a higher bid because 6 is higher than 5. But do I have enough 6s? I only have one 6, so unless Player 0 has two more, the total would be three. But if I bid 3 6s, and there are actually three or more, then the bid would be valid. However, if Player 0 doesn't have enough, I might lose.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid a higher quantity with a lower digit, but I don't have enough of any digit except 3s. I have three 3s, so I could bid 3 3s, but that's lower than 5s, so it's not a higher bid. \n\nWait, no. The rules say a higher bid is either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. So, to make a higher bid than 3 5s, I can either bid 4 of any digit or 3 of a digit higher than 5. \n\nSince I have a 6, I can bid 3 6s. That would be a valid higher bid. But I'm not sure if there are enough 6s. I have one, so Player 0 would need to have at least two for the total to be three. If they don't, then the bid would fail if challenged. \n\nAlternatively, I could challenge the current bid of 3 5s. Since I have zero 5s, if Player 0 has less than three, I would win. But if Player 0 has three or more, I lose. \n\nI don't have any information about Player 0's hand, so it's a bit of a gamble. But considering that the maximum number of any digit is 16 (since each player has 8 digits), but in reality, the distribution is usually spread out. \n\nGiven that I have one 6, bidding 3 6s seems risky because I don't know if Player 0 has two more. On the other hand, challenging might be safer if I think Player 0 is bluffing. \n\nI think I'll challenge because I don't have any 5s, and the bid seems a bit high for a starting move. Maybe Player 0 is trying to bluff, and there are fewer than three 5s in total.\n"
