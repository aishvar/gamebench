        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 3s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move in this Liar's Poker game. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the current situation. My hand is 04680404. That's eight digits: 0, 4, 6, 8, 0, 4, 0, 4. So I have three 0s, four 4s, one 6, and one 8. The other player has their own eight digits, which I can't see.\n\nThe current bid is 4 3s, made by Player 0. My turn now is to either make a higher bid or challenge this bid.\n\nI need to decide whether challenging is a good idea or if I should bid higher. Let's think about the possible counts of 3s across both hands.\n\nIn my hand, I don't have any 3s. So all the 3s, if any, must be in Player 0's hand. The maximum number of 3s possible is 8, since each player has 8 digits. But Player 0 is claiming that there are at least 4 3s in total.\n\nIs it possible that Player 0 has four 3s? Yes, but considering that I have none, they would need to have all four. However, it's also possible that they're bluffing. Maybe they don't have four 3s and are trying to trick me into challenging.\n\nBut wait, the current bid is 4 3s. If I challenge, we'll check the actual count. If there are fewer than 4, I win. If there are 4 or more, Player 0 wins. So, what's the likelihood here?\n\nI have no 3s, so the total count of 3s is equal to what Player 0 has. If they have four 3s, that's a lot\u2014half of their hand. It's possible, but maybe unlikely unless they're really confident.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they don't have four 3s and are trying to bluff me into not challenging. But since I don't have any 3s, the total count can't be more than what Player 0 has. So if I challenge, the outcome depends on how many 3s Player 0 actually has.\n\nGiven that I don't have any 3s, the total count is entirely based on Player 0's hand. If they have four 3s, that's a strong hand, but if they don't, then the bid is invalid. Since I don't have any 3s, I can't contribute to the count, making it more likely that the bid is a bluff because Player 0 might not have as many as they claim.\n\nSo, considering all this, challenging the bid seems like a good move. It's a risk, but given that I don't have any 3s and the bid is relatively high, it's worth testing whether Player 0 is truthful or not.\n"
