        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Let's count the digits: 5 appears once, 3 appears twice, 7 appears twice, 9 appears three times, 6 appears once, and 0 appears once. The most frequent digit in my hand is 9 with three occurrences. Since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total digits in play are 16. If I bid 3 9s, there's a good chance that the opponent might have at least one 9, making the total count higher. However, starting with the highest possible digit I have might be risky. Alternatively, bidding 4 9s could be a bluff, but it's safer to start with 3 9s to not overcommit. Since the bid must be strictly higher than None, any valid bid works. Choosing 3 9s seems reasonable based on my hand's composition.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 9s\"\n}",
