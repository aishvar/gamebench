You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the game.\n\nMy hand is 94097710. Let me break that down into individual digits: 9, 4, 0, 9, 7, 7, 1, 0. So, I have two 9s, two 7s, two 0s, and one each of 4 and 1. That's my hand.\n\nThe current bid is 3 0s, made by Player 1. The bid history shows that I started by bidding 2 9s, and then Player 1 upped it to 3 0s. Now it's my turn again. I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the possible bids I can make. Since the current bid is 3 0s, my next bid needs to be higher. Higher can mean either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. So, I could bid 4 of any digit, or 3 of a digit higher than 0, which is any digit from 1 to 9.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 0s. Since the total number of digits in play is 16 (8 each), the maximum possible for any digit is 16. But 0s are already in my hand, so I know that the total number of 0s is at least 2. The current bid is 3, so if I challenge, I need to see if there are at least 3 0s in total.\n\nBut wait, I have two 0s, so if the other player has one or more 0s, the total would be 3 or more. Alternatively, if they have none, it's just 2. So, I don't know exactly, but I can try to assess the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider making a higher bid. Let's see what I can back up. I have two 9s, two 7s, two 0s, and one each of 4 and 1. So, if I bid on 9s, I can say 2 9s, but that's lower than the current bid of 3 0s. Wait, no, the current bid is 3 0s, so to make a higher bid, I can either go to 4 of any digit or 3 of a higher digit.\n\nWait, the current bid is 3 0s. So, higher would be 4 of any digit or 3 of 1s, 3 of 2s, etc. So, for example, I could bid 3 1s, but I only have one 1, so that's risky. Or 3 4s, but I have only one 4. 3 7s: I have two, but the other player might have one, making it three. Similarly, 3 9s: I have two, so if the other player has one, that's three.\n\nAlternatively, I can bid 4 of a digit I have at least two of. For example, 4 7s would require that there are at least four 7s in total. I have two, so the other player would need to have two as well. That's possible, but uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, I can bid 4 0s, but I only have two, so unless the other player has two, that's four. But if I bid 4 0s, and the total is only three, I would lose.\n\nHmm, challenging might be safer. If I challenge the current bid of 3 0s, and the total is less than 3, I win. If it's 3 or more, I lose. So, I have two 0s. If the other player has at least one 0, the total is 3 or more, and I lose. If they have none, I win.\n\nDo I think the other player has at least one 0? Well, in their turn, they bid 3 0s after I bid 2 9s. Maybe they have some 0s, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe they're bluffing.\n\nAlternatively, I could make a bid that I can back up. Let me see. I have two 7s. If I bid 3 7s, that would require the total to be at least three. Since I have two, the other player would need at least one. Is that likely? Maybe, but it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 4 7s, but that's four, so I have two, so the other player needs two. That's possible but uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 9s. I have two, so the other player needs one. If they have one, it's three. If not, it's two, and the bid fails.\n\nI think challenging might be a safer bet because if I challenge and the total is less than 3, I win. But if it's 3 or more, I lose. Given that I have two 0s, the other player could have one, making it three. So, the chance is 50-50, but maybe the other player is trying to bluff.\n\nAlternatively, I can make a bid that I can support. Let me check the digits I have multiple of: 0,7,9. I have two of each. So, if I bid 3 7s, and the other player has at least one, I'm safe. But if they have none, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 9s, same logic.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 4 0s, but that's risky because I have two, and the other player may have two, making it four, but if they have only one, it's three, which is less than four, so the bid would fail.\n\nI think the safest move might be to challenge because the current bid is 3 0s, and I have two. If the other player doesn't have any, I win. If they have one, I lose. It's a 50-50 chance, but maybe they don't have any, so I'll challenge.\n"
