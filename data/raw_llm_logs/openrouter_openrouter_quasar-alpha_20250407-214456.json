The optimal opening bid usually targets a digit I have multiple copies of, maximizing the likelihood that the total count is at least as high as my bid. Since I have two 0's and two 8's, I can safely start with a conservative opening bid of 2 zeros, which is a standard safe opening bid and forces the opponent to either raise or challenge with little information.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 0\"\n}",
