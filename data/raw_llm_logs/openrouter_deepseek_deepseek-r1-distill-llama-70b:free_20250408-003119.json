You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the current bid on the table is \"2 0s\" made by Player 0. My hand is 84276548. I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have the digits 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 5, 4, 8. So, I have two 8s, two 4s, and one each of 2, 7, 6, and 5. I don't have any 0s in my hand. Since each player has 8 digits, the total number of digits in play is 16. \n\nNow, the current bid is 2 0s. That means Player 0 is claiming that there are at least two 0s in total between both players. But I don't have any 0s, so if Player 0 also doesn't have any, the total would be 0, which is less than 2. However, Player 0 might have some 0s in their hand. Since I don't know their hand, I have to make an educated guess.\n\nI have to consider the possible number of 0s Player 0 could have. If they have two 0s, the total would be exactly 2, which makes their bid valid. If they have more than two, it's still valid. But if they have one or none, the bid would be invalid. \n\nGiven that the initial bid is low (only 2), it's possible they're trying to start with a safe bet. But since I have no 0s, I'm relying on whether they have at least two. I don't have any information about their hand, so I have to decide based on probability.\n\nAnother angle is to think about possible alternative bids. Since I have two 8s, I could potentially bid on 8s. The current bid is 2 0s, so I could bid a higher quantity or a higher digit. Bidding 3 8s would be a higher quantity than 2, but I'm not sure if there are that many 8s in total. Alternatively, I could bid a higher digit with the same quantity, like 2 9s, but I don't have any 9s, so that might be risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should challenge the bid. If I challenge and the total 0s are less than 2, I win. If they are 2 or more, I lose. Since I don't have any 0s, the only way the bid is valid is if Player 0 has at least two 0s. But considering that each player has 8 digits, having two 0s isn't too uncommon, but it's not guaranteed.\n\nI'm a bit torn. On one hand, challenging could pay off if Player 0 is bluffing. On the other hand, if they do have two 0s, I lose. Since the bid is low, maybe it's more likely they're telling the truth. \n\nAlternatively, making a bid of 3 8s could be a good move because I have two, and maybe Player 0 has one, making the total three. But that's speculative. If I bid 3 8s and the total is exactly three, I win. If it's more, I still win. If it's less, I lose. \n\nGiven that I have a strong hand in 8s, maybe it's better to bid on that rather than challenge. It's a safer move because I have some control over the outcome based on my own hand. Challenging is riskier because it's entirely dependent on Player 0's hand, which I can't see.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to bid 3 8s. It's a higher quantity than the current bid, and based on my hand, there's a good chance the total could meet or exceed that.\n"
