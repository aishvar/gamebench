You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn to make a bid. The game is between me (Player 0) and Player 1. My hand is 09287254. The current bid is None, which means this is the first bid of the game. I need to decide whether to bid or challenge, but since there's no previous bid, I can't challenge. So, I have to make the first bid.\n\nFirst, I should look at my hand to see which digits I have. Let me list them out: 0, 9, 2, 8, 7, 2, 5, 4. So, I have two 2s, and one each of 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9. The digits I have multiple of are 2s, with two of them.\n\nSince the current bid is None, I can start by bidding on any digit. The goal is to make a bid that's likely to be true but also not too high that it's easily challengeable. Since I have two 2s, I can consider bidding on 2s. But I don't know what Player 1 has, so I have to make an educated guess.\n\nI could bid on 2 2s because I have two of them. But maybe I can go higher to set a stronger foundation. However, if I bid too high and the opponent challenges, I might lose. So, a safe starting point might be to bid 2 2s. Alternatively, I could choose another digit I have and bid 1 on that, but 2 2s seems better because I have more of them.\n\nWait, but the opponent might have more 2s. If I bid 2 2s and they have three, then the total would be five, which is more than two, so I would win. But if they have zero, then the total is two, which meets my bid. So, it's a relatively safe bet.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I don't have, but that's riskier because I don't know the opponent's hand. It's better to bid on what I have to have some control.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think I'll bid 2 2s. It's a modest bid, and since I have two, it's likely that even if the opponent has none, the bid holds. If they have one or more, it's even better. This seems like a solid starting move.\n"
