        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, the game is between two players, each with 8 secret digits. The goal is to bid on the total count of a specific digit across both players' hands. My hand is 94386502. Since it's my turn and the current bid is None, I need to make the first bid.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have the digits: 9, 4, 3, 8, 6, 5, 0, 2. Let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\n- 0: 1\n- 2: 1\n- 3: 1\n- 4: 1\n- 5: 1\n- 6: 1\n- 8: 1\n- 9: 1\n\nSo, each digit appears exactly once in my hand. Since the other player also has 8 digits, the maximum any digit can appear is 16 times in total. But since each digit is unique in my hand, unless the opponent has duplicates, the total count for each digit is at least 1 (from me) plus whatever they have.\n\nSince the current bid is None, I can start by bidding on any digit. I need to choose a digit where I think the total count is at least as high as my bid. \n\nLooking at my digits, I have one of each, so if I bid on any of them, the opponent could potentially have zero or more. But since I don't know their hand, I need to choose a digit that's likely to have a higher count.\n\nAlternatively, I can choose a digit that's not in my hand, but that seems riskier because I don't have any information about it.\n\nWait, but if I bid on a digit I have, say 9, and the opponent has none, the total would be 1, which is lower than my bid. So I need to bid a quantity that's likely to be met.\n\nSince I have one of each digit, the minimum I can bid is 1. But since the first bid is None, I can start with the lowest possible bid to test the waters.\n\nSo, I can bid 1 of any digit I have. Let's pick the highest digit I have, which is 9, to make the bid as strong as possible. That way, if the opponent challenges, I might have a better chance since higher digits are less likely to be in their hand.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a lower digit, but starting with a higher digit might give me an advantage in case they don't have it.\n\nWait, but the opponent could have multiple of a lower digit, which I don't know. So maybe it's safer to bid on a higher digit where the chance of them having multiple is lower.\n\nSo, I'll decide to bid 1 9s. That's a safe start because I know I have at least one, and the opponent might not have any, but even if they do, the total would be at least 1, which meets my bid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 of a digit if I think the opponent has at least one. But since I don't know their hand, it's safer to start with 1.\n\nSo, my action will be to bid 1 9s.\n"
