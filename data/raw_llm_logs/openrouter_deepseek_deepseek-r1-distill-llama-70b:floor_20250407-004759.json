You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I have here.\n\nFirst, my hand is 36971468. Let me count how many of each digit I have. Breaking it down: 3, 6, 9, 7, 1, 4, 6, 8. So, I have two 6s, and one each of 3, 9, 7, 1, 4, and 8.\n\nThe current bid is 3 7s, made by Player 1. Before that, I had bid 2 6s. So, the bidding has gone from 2 6s to 3 7s. Now it's my turn again.\n\nI need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Let's think about the possible options.\n\nIf I challenge, I'll reveal the total number of 7s between both players. If the total is at least 3, Player 1 wins. If it's less, I win. From my hand, I have one 7. So, Player 1 must have at least two 7s for the bid to be valid. But I don't know their hand, so I can't be sure. However, considering that the maximum number of any digit is 16 (since each player has 8 digits), but that's across all digits. For a single digit, the maximum possible is 16, but that's extremely unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to make a higher bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the current bid is 3 7s, I could bid 4 of a higher digit or 4 of the same digit. But I only have one 7, so bidding 4 7s would be risky because I don't have enough. Maybe I can look at other digits I have in higher quantities.\n\nI have two 6s. If I bid 4 6s, that would be a higher bid because 4 is more than 3, and 6s are higher than 7s? Wait, no, 7 is higher than 6. So, to make a higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or the digit. Since 7 is higher than 6, I can't just bid the same quantity with a higher digit than 7. So, the next option is to increase the quantity. If I bid 4 of a digit that's equal or higher than 7, but I don't have enough 7s. Alternatively, I can bid 4 of a lower digit, but that wouldn't be higher than 3 7s because the digit is lower.\n\nWait, no. The bid must be strictly higher, which can be either higher quantity or same quantity but higher digit. So, 3 8s would be higher than 3 7s because 8 is higher than 7. Do I have enough 8s? I have one 8 in my hand. So, if I bid 3 8s, that would require that together we have at least three 8s. Since I have one, Player 1 would need at least two. But I don't know their hand, so it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, I can bid 4 of a digit where I have at least two, but since I only have two 6s, I could bid 4 6s. However, 4 6s is a higher quantity than 3 7s, but since 6 is lower than 7, is that allowed? Wait, no. The bid must be strictly higher, which can be either higher quantity or same quantity but higher digit. So, 4 6s is higher than 3 7s because 4 > 3, regardless of the digit. So, that's a valid bid.\n\nBut is 4 6s a safe bid? I have two 6s, so Player 1 would need at least two more 6s to make the total four. If they have two, then it's exactly four. If they have more, it's higher. If they have less, then the bid is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 8s, as I have one 8. That would require Player 1 to have at least two 8s. But I don't know if they have that.\n\nAnother option is to challenge the bid. If I challenge 3 7s, and the total is less than 3, I win. I have one 7, so Player 1 needs at least two. If they have two, the total is three, and the bid is valid. If they have one or none, I win. But I don't know their hand, so it's a 50-50 guess.\n\nConsidering the options, making a bid of 4 6s seems safer because I can control the outcome based on my hand. Since I have two 6s, if Player 1 has at least two, the bid is valid. If not, I might lose, but it's a calculated risk. Alternatively, challenging is also a possibility, but without knowing their hand, it's uncertain.\n\nI think I'll go with bidding 4 6s because I have two in my hand, and it's a higher quantity than the current bid, making it a valid move. Plus, it puts pressure on the opponent to either challenge or bid higher, which could give me more information in the next round.\n"
