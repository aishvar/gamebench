You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to decide whether to challenge the current bid of 5 8s or make a higher bid. \n\nFirst, my hand is 91246147. Let me check the digits in my hand. The digits are 9,1,2,4,6,1,4,7. So looking for 8s in my hand: none. The opponent's bid is 5 8s. \n\nThe current bid is 5 8s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity to 6 or keep the same quantity but choose a higher digit (like 5 9s). But since the opponent's bid is 5 8s, any bid with 5 of a higher digit (like 5 9s) would be higher, or 6 of any digit. \n\nWait, the rules say that a higher bid can be either a higher quantity, or same quantity but higher digit. So 5 9s would be higher than 5 8s because the digit is higher. Alternatively, 6 of any digit would also work. \n\nNow, considering my hand. Since I have no 8s, maybe the opponent is bluffing. But I need to decide if challenging is better. The total digits are 16. If the opponent's bid is 5 8s, that's possible if they have some 8s. But if I challenge, and the actual count is less than 5, I win. But if it's 5 or more, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid higher, say 5 9s, then I'm claiming there are at least 5 nines. But I have one 9 in my hand. The opponent might have some, but maybe not enough. Or maybe bid 6 of a lower digit. \n\nLooking at my hand again: digits present are 9,1,2,4,6,7. The opponent's previous bid was 5 8s. Since I have no 8s, the total number of 8s is whatever the opponent has. If they have, say, 3 8s, then the bid of 5 would be a bluff. But if they have 5 or more, then it's valid. \n\nHmm, challenging might be risky if they actually have enough. Alternatively, maybe I can outbid them. Let's see what digits I have in quantity. \n\nIn my hand: \n\n1 appears twice (positions 2 and 6)\n4 appears twice (positions 4 and 7)\n9,2,6,7 each once. \n\nSo the highest counts I have are two of 1s and 4s. \n\nIf I want to make a bid higher than 5 8s, I can go for 5 9s (since 9 is higher than 8). But I only have one 9. Unless I think the opponent has 4 or more 9s, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe bid 6 of a lower digit, but I don't have that many. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 6 1s. Since I have two 1s, and maybe the opponent has some. But if I bid 6 1s, that's a higher quantity. But is that a good move? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best play is to challenge because the opponent's bid is 5 8s. The total digits are 16, so 5 is possible but maybe not too high. Since I have zero 8s, the opponent could have up to 8 digits (if they have all 8s, but that's impossible since their hand is 8 digits). Wait, each player has 8 digits, so maximum 8 8s possible. So 5 is within the possible range. \n\nBut if I challenge, and the opponent has, say, two 8s, then the total would be 2 (their hand) plus my 0, so 2 <5, so I win. But if they have three or four, then 3 or 4 is still less than 5. Only if they have 5 or more would they be right. \n\nThe opponent is Player 1, and their previous bids were: \n\nFirst, they bid 4 1s (after my initial 3 1s). Then they went to 5 8s after my 4 4s. \n\nHmm, maybe they have some 8s. But maybe they are bluffing because they can't have 5. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid 5 9s. Since 9 is higher than 8, that's a valid higher bid. The bid would be 5 9s. But I have one 9. If the opponent has four 9s, then total is five. But that's possible only if their entire hand is four 9s and the rest. But maybe they don't. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to push me to call, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to challenge because the bid of 5 8s might be a bluff, especially since they had to go from 4 4s to 5 8s. Maybe they don't have many 8s. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 6 of something, like 6 1s. Since I have two, maybe the opponent has three, making it five? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the bid of 5 8s is too high. Since each player has 8 digits, the maximum possible 8s is 8 (if both have all 8s, but that's 16, but the bid is 5. Wait, the total is all players' hands, so 8+8=16 digits. So the max possible 8s is 16, but realistically, each player has 8. So if the opponent has 5 8s, that's possible, but maybe they don't. \n\nHmm. Considering that I have zero 8s, the opponent would need at least 5 8s in their own hand. But they have only 8 digits. 5 is possible (they could have 5 8s and 3 others). But is that likely? Maybe not, unless they have a lot. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to trick me into challenging, but I have to make a decision. \n\nIf I challenge, there's a chance I win if they have less than 5. But there's also a risk. Alternatively, bidding higher might be safer, but what's a good bid? \n\nIf I bid 5 9s, that's higher because the digit is higher. I have one 9, so maybe the opponent has four 9s. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe they have none, making the total 1, which is way below 5. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the bid of 5 9s is a good bluff, since I can't have enough, but maybe I can force them to challenge me. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to challenge because 5 8s is a bit high, especially since I have none. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 6 1s, since I have two 1s, maybe they have some. Let's see, if I bid 6 1s, then the opponent's previous bid was 4 1s. So they might have some 1s. \n\nWait, the bid history shows that I first bid 3 1s, then they raised to 4 1s. Then I bid 4 4s, and they went to 5 8s. \n\nSo they might have some 1s but then shifted to 8s. \n\nHmm, tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe challenging is better here. Because the bid is 5 8s, and since I have none, the opponent would need to have at least 5. But with 8 digits, they could have 5, but maybe they don't. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the bid is too high. Let's think: total possible 8s is up to 8 (if they have all 8s, but then their bid is 5, which is possible. But if they have 5, then total is 5. But if they have 4, then total is 4. \n\nSince I have zero, the total is exactly their count. So the bid is 5, so if they have 5 or more, they win on challenge. \n\nThe question is: is it likely that they have 5 or more 8s? \n\nSince they bid 5, they might be trying to push me to challenge. But maybe they have 5. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have only 2 or 3, and are bluffing. \n\nI think the risk here is that if I challenge and they have 5, I lose. But if I don't challenge, I have to bid higher. \n\nWhat's the alternative bid? \n\nTo bid higher than 5 8s, I can go to 5 9s, which is a higher digit. So that's allowed. \n\nAlternatively, bid 6 of any digit. Let's see: \n\nThe highest bid possible. \n\nIf I choose 5 9s, then I'm claiming there are at least 5 nines. I have one, so opponent must have at least 4. Unlikely, but possible. \n\nAlternatively, bid 6 of a lower digit, like 6 1s. Since I have two, opponent would need four. But they had bid 4 1s before, so maybe they have some. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 5 4s. Wait, but 5 is higher than the previous quantity. Wait, the previous bid is 5 8s. To bid higher, I can either increase quantity to 6, or same quantity with higher digit. \n\nWait, the current bid is 5 8s. So to bid higher, I can do 5 9s (same quantity but higher digit), or any 6 of any digit. \n\nSo 5 9s is a valid bid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should bid 6 of something. \n\nBut what's the best option? \n\nIf I bid 5 9s, and they have 0, the total is 1 (mine), so that's a loss. But if I bid 5 9s and they have 4, then total is 5 (mine 1 plus theirs 4), which meets the bid. But then they can choose to either challenge me or raise. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest is to challenge. \n\nAlternatively, since I have no 8s, and the bid is 5, maybe it's a bluff. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might have 3 8s, making total 3. \n\nHmm, the bid is 5 8s, and since I have none, the opponent must have at least 5. \n\nWait, if they have 5, that's possible. But having 5 8s in their hand would mean they have 5 of them, and 3 others. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have 4, so total is 4, which is under 5, so challenging would win. \n\nI think the decision hinges on whether I think the opponent has 5 or more 8s. Since I don't have any, I can't be sure. \n\nGiven that the opponent chose to go from 4 1s to 5 8s after my 4 4s, maybe they are trying to switch topics. Maybe they don't have many 8s and are bluffing. \n\nIn that case, challenging might be better. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 5 9s, which is higher, but that might be a weak bid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to challenge because the bid of 5 8s is a bit high, especially since I have none, and the opponent's previous bids didn't include 8s before. \n\nSo, I think I'll choose to challenge."
