You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, the rules: each player has 8 secret digits, and we take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit across all hands. The bid has to be higher than the previous one, either by quantity or by digit if the quantity is the same. I can also choose to challenge the last bid if I think it's not valid.\n\nLooking at my hand: it's 16668503. Let me count the digits. So, digits are 1, 6, 6, 6, 8, 5, 0, 3. That's eight digits. Now, I need to see what digits I have and how many of each.\n\nBreaking it down:\n- 1: appears once\n- 6: appears three times\n- 8: once\n- 5: once\n- 0: once\n- 3: once\n\nSo, the highest count I have is three 6s. Since the current bid is none, I can start the bidding. My goal is to make a bid that's likely to be correct but also gives me a good chance of winning if challenged.\n\nI should consider what digits other players might have. Since it's the first bid, I don't have any information from previous bids, so I have to rely on my own hand and the probabilities.\n\nIf I bid based on my 6s, I have three of them. Since there are two players, each with eight digits, the total possible digits are 16. So, if I bid 4 6s, that would mean there are at least four 6s in total. Given that I have three, it's possible that the other player has one more. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider other digits. For example, I have three 6s, which is the highest in my hand. Bidding on a higher digit like 7 or 9 might be riskier because I don't have any of those. Bidding on a lower digit like 5 or 8 might not be as strong since I don't have many of those either.\n\nSo, the safest and strongest bid I can make is based on my three 6s. Bidding 4 6s is a logical step because it's just one more than what I have, and it's a higher digit than others I have, which makes it a better bid.\n\nI should also think about what the opponent might do. If I bid 4 6s, the opponent might challenge if they think it's unlikely. But considering that I have three, and there are 16 digits in total, it's reasonable to assume there could be four. Plus, starting with a moderate bid gives me room to increase later if needed.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I think the best move is to bid 4 6s. It's a solid opening bid based on my hand and the possible total count.\n"
