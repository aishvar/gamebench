        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 7s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

However, to make a bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have enough information to safely challenge the bid and considering my hand doesn't contain any 7s, I should look for a digit that appears frequently enough to make a reasonable bid. My hand contains two 3s and other digits that appear once. Bidding on a digit I have more of, like the 3, but increasing the quantity to make it higher than the current bid isn't feasible since my hand doesn't support a high enough quantity for any digit to confidently bid higher without risking a challenge. However, considering the nature of Liar's Poker, I must make a move that either challenges the current bid or makes a new bid. Given the current bid is '3 7s', and without having 7s in my hand, challenging seems like a viable option because the bid seems somewhat high for a digit I don't have, but I must consider if it's plausible for the other player to have enough 7s to make this bid valid. Since I don't have enough 7s to contribute to the total and the bid is already at '3 7s', challenging this bid might be risky if the other player indeed has a couple of 7s. Thus, I need to decide based on the likelihood of the other player's hand containing enough 7s to fulfill the bid. Given the lack of information about the other player's hand and the fact that my hand doesn't contain any 7s, making a bid on a different digit that I have more of, or challenging, are my options. Considering these factors, challenging might not be the best move without more confidence that the bid is incorrect. Looking at my hand again, I see that I have two 3s, which could be a basis for a bid, but the quantity would need to be higher than 3 to outbid '3 7s'. Since my hand doesn't support a higher quantity bid on any digit confidently, and considering the rules that allow bidding on any digit, I must weigh the risk of challenging versus the risk of being challenged on a new bid. Given these considerations and the need to make a strategic decision, bidding higher on a digit I can somewhat support or challenging are my main considerations.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 3s\"\n}",
