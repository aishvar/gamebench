        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 0s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I'm playing Liar's Poker, and I need to decide my next move. The current bid is 3 0s from Player 1, and I have to either make a higher bid or challenge. \n\nFirst, I should look at my hand. My digits are 3, 6, 8, 5, 9, 0, 2, 5. So I have one 0, two 5s, and the rest are single digits. The current bid is 3 0s, which means they're claiming there are at least three 0s in total between both players. \n\nI only have one 0, so if Player 1 has at least two 0s, that would make the total three. But I don't know their hand. Maybe they're bluffing. On the other hand, maybe they have two 0s, making their bid correct. \n\nIf I challenge, and the total is 3 or more, I lose. If it's less, I win. But considering I have one 0, the opponent would need at least two. It's possible they have two, but it's also possible they have only one, making the total two, which would mean their bid of 3 is false. \n\nAlternatively, I could make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 3 0s, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. The next higher digit is 1, but that's not useful because digits go from 0-9. So maybe I can bid 4 0s if I think there are four, but I only have one. That seems risky. Or I could bid a higher digit with the same quantity, like 3 1s. But I don't know if there are enough 1s. \n\nWait, in my hand, I don't have any 1s, so I can't be sure. Maybe I should check if there's a safer digit to bid on. I have two 5s, so maybe I can bid 2 5s, but the previous bid was 2 5s from me, and they increased it to 3 0s. So I can't go back to 5s unless I increase the quantity. \n\nAlternatively, I can try to bid 4 5s, but I only have two, so unless the opponent has two more, that's four total. But that's a gamble. \n\nHmm, challenging might be safer. If I think the opponent is bluffing, I can challenge. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider the probabilities. Since I have one 0, the opponent could have two, making the total three. Or maybe they have one, making it two. It's a 50-50 chance. \n\nGiven that, maybe it's better to challenge because if I'm wrong, I lose, but if I'm right, I win. Alternatively, if I bid and lose, I might be out of the game. \n\nI think challenging is the safer move here because the risk of the bid being correct is high, and I don't have enough information to make a confident higher bid.\n"
