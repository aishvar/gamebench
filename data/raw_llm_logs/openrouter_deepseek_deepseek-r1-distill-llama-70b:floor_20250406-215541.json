You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn to make a bid. The current bid is None, which means I'm the first to bid. My hand is 39378158. Let me think about what I should do.\n\nFirst, I should look at my own digits. Breaking down my hand: 3, 9, 3, 7, 8, 1, 5, 8. So, I have two 3s, one 9, one 7, two 8s, one 1, and one 5. That's eight digits total, which makes sense since each player has eight.\n\nSince the current bid is None, I can start by bidding any quantity and digit. I want to choose a bid that gives me a good chance of being correct but also doesn't overcommit. Looking at my digits, I have duplicates on 3 and 8. Maybe I can bid based on those.\n\nLet me consider the 3s first. I have two of them. If I bid 2 3s, that's a safe start because I know I have two. But maybe I can go higher. If I bid 3 3s, I'm assuming the other player has at least one 3. But I don't know their hand, so that's risky. Maybe 2 3s is better.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the 8s, I have two of them. Bidding 2 8s could be a good start. But again, if I go higher, like 3 8s, I'm hoping the opponent has at least one. It's possible, but not certain.\n\nI also have a single 9, 7, 1, and 5. Bidding on those seems less likely since I only have one each. The opponent might not have any, making my bid too high.\n\nSo, between 2 3s and 2 8s, which is better? Both seem equally safe. Maybe I should choose the higher digit to give myself more flexibility in future bids. So, 2 8s might be better because 8 is a higher digit than 3. That way, if someone wants to bid higher, they have to either increase the quantity or choose a higher digit, which might be harder.\n\nWait, but if I bid 2 8s, and the opponent has none, then the total is 2, which meets my bid. If they have one, it's 3, which is still good. If they have two, it's 4, which is even better. So, 2 8s seems like a solid opening bid.\n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 3s, it's similar. But since 8 is a higher digit, starting with that might be more advantageous in case someone wants to follow with the same quantity but a higher digit.\n\nSo, I think I'll go with BID: 2 8s. It's a reasonable starting point, and I have two of them, so it's likely to be correct. Plus, it gives me a good foundation for future bids.\n"
