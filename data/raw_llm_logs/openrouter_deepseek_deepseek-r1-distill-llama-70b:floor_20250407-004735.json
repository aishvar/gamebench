        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, my hand is 39840381. Let me break that down. Each digit is separate, so I have 3, 9, 8, 4, 0, 3, 8, 1. Wait, let me count them again to make sure I get each digit right. So, the digits are: 3, 9, 8, 4, 0, 3, 8, 1. That means I have two 3s, two 8s, and the rest are single digits: 9, 4, 0, 1.\n\nThe current bid is 2 6s, made by Player 0. So, Player 0 is claiming that there are at least two 6s in total between both players. Now, I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid.\n\nLooking at my hand, I don't have any 6s. So, if I were to challenge, I would be betting that the total number of 6s is less than 2. But since I don't have any, the other player could have 0, 1, or 2. If Player 0 has at least two 6s, then the bid is valid. If not, then challenging would be the right move.\n\nBut wait, I also have the option to bid higher. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the current bid is 2 6s, I can either bid a higher quantity of 6s, like 3 6s, or the same quantity but a higher digit, like 2 7s, 2 8s, etc.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 8s. So, I could potentially bid 2 8s. That would be a higher bid because 8 is higher than 6. Alternatively, I could bid a higher quantity of a lower digit, but since I don't have enough of any digit except maybe 3s or 8s, it's better to go with the higher digit.\n\nIf I bid 2 8s, I'm claiming there are at least two 8s in total. Since I have two 8s myself, that would make the total at least two, so the bid would be valid. But I have to consider if Player 0 might have more 8s. If Player 0 has, say, three 8s, then the total would be five, which is way above my bid. But since I only have two, the minimum I can guarantee is two. So, bidding 2 8s seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could challenge the current bid of 2 6s. Since I have zero 6s, if Player 0 also has zero or one, then the total would be less than two, and I'd win the challenge. But if Player 0 has two or more, I'd lose. So, challenging is risky because I don't know Player 0's hand.\n\nGiven that I can make a safe bid with my 8s, it's better to bid 2 8s. This way, I don't risk losing by challenging, and I can control the game's direction. Plus, since 8 is a high digit, it might make it harder for Player 0 to counter without a high digit or a higher quantity.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to bid 2 8s. It's a valid higher bid, and I can back it up with my own hand.\n"
