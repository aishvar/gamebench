You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker situation. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the game state. My hand is 98528646. That means I have the digits 9, 8, 5, 2, 8, 6, 4, 6. So, in my own hand, I have two 8s, two 6s, and one each of 9, 5, 2, and 4. \n\nThe current bid is 2 7s, made by Player 0. The bid history shows that Player 0 started with 2 1s, then I bid 2 6s, and now Player 0 has upped it to 2 7s. My task is to either make a higher bid or challenge this current bid.\n\nI need to determine if 2 7s is a reasonable bid. Since I don't have any 7s in my hand, I can only guess how many 7s Player 0 might have. The total number of 7s between both players could be 0, 1, or 2. But since Player 0 bid 2 7s, they might have at least one 7, maybe two. \n\nNow, considering the possible maximum, there are 16 digits in total (8 each). So, the maximum number of 7s possible is 16, but realistically, it's much lower. Player 0's bid is 2, which isn't too high, but I'm not sure if they're bluffing.\n\nIf I challenge, and the total 7s are 2 or more, Player 0 wins. If it's less than 2, I win. But since I have no 7s, the only 7s would be in Player 0's hand. If Player 0 has 2, then the total is 2. If they have 1, the total is 1. If they have 0, the total is 0. \n\nGiven that, I think Player 0 might have at least one 7, maybe two. But I'm not certain. If I challenge and lose, I lose the game. If I challenge and win, I gain the advantage. \n\nAlternatively, I could try to make a higher bid. My options are to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the current bid is 2 7s, I could bid 3 of a higher digit or the same digit with a higher quantity. But looking at my hand, I have two 6s and two 8s. Maybe I can bid higher on 6s or 8s.\n\nWait, the current bid is 2 7s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity beyond 2 or choose a higher digit. Let's see, 7 is a high digit, so the next higher digit is 8, 9. If I bid on 8s, I have two in my hand. So, I could bid 2 8s, which is a higher digit than 7, so it's a valid bid. Alternatively, I could bid 3 6s since I have two, but that's a lower digit than 7, so I'd have to increase the quantity to make it higher. \n\nWait, no. The bid must be strictly higher. So, 2 8s is higher than 2 7s because 8 is higher than 7. Similarly, 3 6s would also be higher than 2 7s because the quantity is higher, even though the digit is lower. \n\nSo, I have options. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. Let me think about which is safer. \n\nIf I challenge, and the total 7s are 2 or more, I lose. If it's less, I win. Since I don't have any 7s, Player 0 could have 0, 1, or 2. It's possible they have 2, but maybe they're bluffing with just 1. \n\nOn the other hand, if I make a bid, I can choose to bid 2 8s. Since I have two 8s, the total could be 2 (if Player 0 has none) up to 4 (if Player 0 has two). But since Player 0 just bid 2 7s, maybe they don't have many 8s. So, 2 8s could be a safe bid because even if they have zero, the total is 2, which meets the bid. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 6s. I have two, so if Player 0 has at least one, the total would be 3 or more. But if they have none, the total is 2, which is less than 3, so that would be risky. \n\nSo, between 2 8s and 3 6s, 2 8s seems safer because I know I have two, and even if Player 0 has none, it's still exactly 2, which meets the bid. \n\nTherefore, I think making a bid of 2 8s is a good move. It's higher than 2 7s, and I have a solid foundation in my hand to support it.\n"
