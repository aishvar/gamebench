Additionally, if they had such a strong holding of ones, they might have bid higher. Based on the previous bidding where I bid 3 zeros (knowing I had 3), their choice to bid the same quantity but higher digit seems more like a safe incremental raise rather than a confident bid based on actual holdings.\",\\n    \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\\n}', type='text')"
