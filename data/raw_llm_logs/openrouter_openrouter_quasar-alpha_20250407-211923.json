However, starting with a bid of 2 might be too cautious. Bidding 3 of a digit I hold at least twice is a reasonable opening. Since I have two 0s and two 4s, a bid of 3 fours is a solid opening bid, as it is likely there is at least one more four in the opponent's hand. This balances assertiveness with safety.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 4\"\n}",
