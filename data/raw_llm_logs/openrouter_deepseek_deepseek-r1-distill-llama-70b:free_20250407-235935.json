        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the current bid is 3 8s, made by Player 0. I'm Player 1, and it's my turn. I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. \n\nLooking at my hand, which is 98326908. Let me count how many 8s I have. I see an 8 in the first position and another 8 at the end, so that's two 8s. So I have two 8s in my hand. \n\nNow, the current bid is 3 8s. That means Player 0 is claiming that together, both players have at least three 8s. Since I have two, Player 0 must have at least one 8 for the total to be three. But I don't know how many 8s Player 0 has. \n\nI should consider the possible scenarios. If Player 0 has one 8, then the total is exactly three, which matches the bid. If Player 0 has two or more, then the total would be higher. But if Player 0 has zero, then the total would be two, which is less than the bid, meaning the bid is false.\n\nBut wait, looking at the bid history might give me some clues. The previous bids were 2 4s by Player 0, then I bid 2 8s, and then Player 0 upped it to 3 8s. So Player 0 seems confident about the 8s. Maybe they have at least one 8, or maybe they're bluffing.\n\nI also need to think about the maximum possible. There are two players, each with 8 digits, so 16 digits in total. The maximum number of any digit is 16, but that's extremely rare. For 8s, it's possible but unlikely to have a very high count unless both players have several.\n\nGiven that I have two 8s, if Player 0 has one, the total is three, which is exactly the bid. But if Player 0 has zero, the total is two, which would make the bid a lie. However, if Player 0 has two or more, the total would be four or more, which would make the bid valid.\n\nI need to assess the likelihood. Since I have two 8s, and the bid is 3, it's possible that Player 0 is telling the truth. But without knowing their hand, it's a bit risky to challenge. Alternatively, I could try to make a higher bid.\n\nTo make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the current bid is 3 8s, I could bid 4 8s, which would require that there are at least four 8s in total. Given that I have two, Player 0 would need to have two as well. Alternatively, I could bid the same quantity with a higher digit, but 8 is already the highest digit, so that's not possible.\n\nIf I bid 4 8s, I'm claiming there are at least four 8s. If I have two, Player 0 would need to have two as well. But is that likely? Maybe, but it's also possible they have one or none.\n\nAlternatively, I could challenge the bid. If I challenge, and the total is less than three, I win. But if it's three or more, I lose. Since I have two, the total could be two or three or more, depending on Player 0's hand.\n\nI think challenging might be risky because there's a good chance the total is exactly three. But if I challenge and the total is three, I lose. However, if the total is two, I win. So it's a 50-50 guess, but maybe I can make a more informed decision.\n\nAnother angle: considering the previous bids. Player 0 started with 2 4s, which I responded to with 2 8s. Then Player 0 upped it to 3 8s. Maybe they have at least one 8, making the total three. Or maybe they're trying to bluff.\n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards challenging because if I have two 8s and the bid is three, the only way the bid is true is if Player 0 has at least one. But I don't know their hand. Alternatively, I could bid 4 8s, hoping that they have two, but that's also uncertain.\n\nWait, but if I challenge and the total is exactly three, I lose. If I challenge and it's two, I win. It's a gamble. Alternatively, I could bid 4 8s, which would require four in total. If I have two, Player 0 needs two. It's possible, but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, I could look at other digits. Maybe I have other digits that I can bid on to change the subject, but the current bid is about 8s, so I have to stick with that.\n\nI think challenging is the safer option because if the total is two, I win, but if it's three or more, I lose. But considering that I have two, and the bid is three, it's possible that Player 0 has one, making it exactly three. So the risk is there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should bid 4 8s. If the total is four or more, I win, otherwise, I lose. But I don't know if Player 0 has two or more 8s.\n\nHmm, it's a tough call. I think I'll go with challenging because I have two 8s, and the bid is three. If Player 0 has one, I lose, but if they have zero, I win. It's a bit of a gamble, but I think challenging is the better move here.\n"
