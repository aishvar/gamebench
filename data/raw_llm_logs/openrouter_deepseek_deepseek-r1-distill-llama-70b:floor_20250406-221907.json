You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the game involves two players, each with 8 secret digits. The current bid is 3 1s, made by Player 1. My hand is 68703257. I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid.\n\nLooking at my hand: 6, 8, 7, 0, 3, 2, 5, 7. I notice I have two 7s. That might be useful. The current bid is 3 1s, so I can either bid higher in quantity or digit.\n\nIf I want to bid, I have to go higher than 3 1s. I could try 3 2s since 2 is higher than 1, but I only have one 2 in my hand. Alternatively, I could go for a higher quantity, like 4 of a digit. Let me check my digits:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 0\n- 2: 1\n- 3: 1\n- 5: 1\n- 6: 1\n- 7: 2\n- 8: 1\n\nSo, the highest quantity I have is two 7s. If I bid 2 7s, that's lower than the current bid of 3 1s because both quantity and digit matter. Wait, no\u2014the current bid is 3 1s. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since 3 is the quantity, I could go to 4 of a lower digit, but I don't have enough of any digit except maybe 7s.\n\nWait, no\u2014my maximum is two 7s. So I can't bid 4 of any digit. Alternatively, I could bid the same quantity (3) but a higher digit. Since 1 is the current digit, I can go to 3 2s, 3 3s, etc. But I only have one 2, one 3, etc. So I can't reliably bid 3 of any higher digit because I don't have enough in my hand.\n\nAlternatively, I could challenge the bid. The current bid is 3 1s. Do I think there are at least 3 ones in total? Let's see. I have zero 1s in my hand. So if Player 1 has at least 3, that's possible, but maybe they're bluffing. Since I have none, the total number of 1s would be whatever Player 1 has. They might have 3, but it's also possible they have fewer.\n\nIf I challenge, and the total is less than 3, I win. If it's 3 or more, I lose. Considering that I have none, Player 1 could have 3, but maybe they have only 2. It's a bit risky, but challenging might be a good move if I think they're bluffing.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to make a bid based on my 7s. Since I have two, maybe I can bid 2 7s, but that's lower than 3 1s. So that's not allowed. I can't go lower; I have to go higher.\n\nWait, another thought: the bid has to be strictly higher. So if I can find a digit higher than 1 where I have at least 3, but I don't. So maybe challenging is better.\n\nI think challenging is the better option here because I don't have a strong enough hand to make a higher bid, and the current bid might be a bluff.\n"
