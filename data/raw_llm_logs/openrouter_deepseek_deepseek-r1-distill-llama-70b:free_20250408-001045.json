You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me break down the situation step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that each player has 8 secret digits, so there are 16 digits in total. The current bid is 4 7s by Player 0, and it's my turn. I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have the digits 5, 7, 1, 1, 5, 3, 2, 8. So, let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\n- 0s: 0\n- 1s: 2\n- 2s: 1\n- 3s: 1\n- 5s: 2\n- 7s: 1\n- 8s: 1\n\nSo, I have only one 7. The current bid is 4 7s, which means Player 0 is claiming that there are at least four 7s in total between both players. Since I only have one 7, Player 0 must have at least three 7s for the total to be four. \n\nI should consider the maximum possible number of 7s. If I have one, the maximum Player 0 can have is 7 (since there are 8 digits each). But the bid is 4, so they need at least three. \n\nI should think about the previous bids to understand the game flow. The bid history shows that Player 0 started with 3 7s, I responded with 4 5s, and then Player 0 went back to 4 7s. This might indicate that Player 0 is trying to push the bid higher on 7s, possibly because they have a strong hand in that digit.\n\nConsidering my own hand, I don't have enough 7s to support a higher bid on 7s. If I try to bid higher on 7s, I would have to go to 5 7s, but that seems risky because I only have one. Alternatively, I could try to bid on another digit where I have more, like 5s. But my previous bid was 4 5s, and the current bid is 4 7s. To bid higher, I could go to 5 5s, but I only have two, so that's not possible. \n\nAnother option is to challenge the current bid. If I challenge, the total number of 7s will be revealed. If there are at least four, I lose, but if there are fewer, I win. Given that I have one 7, Player 0 needs to have at least three. Is that likely? \n\nI don't have any information about Player 0's hand except their bids. They started with 3 7s, which I countered with 4 5s, and then they upped it to 4 7s. This could mean they have a strong 7 count. But considering the total possible, with 16 digits, having four 7s is possible but not extremely high. \n\nI have to weigh the risk. If I challenge and there are indeed four or more 7s, I lose. If not, I win. Since I only have one 7, the maximum Player 0 can have is seven, but the minimum they need is three. Without more information, it's a bit of a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, could I make a higher bid on another digit? Let's see. My hand has two 5s, two 1s, and one each of 2,3,7,8. The highest digits I have multiple of are 1s and 5s. The current bid is 4 7s, so to bid higher, I could go to 5 of a lower digit, but that's not helpful. Or I could try a higher digit with the same quantity, like 4 8s, but I only have one 8. \n\nWait, another thought: the previous bid was 4 5s from me, and Player 0 went back to 4 7s. Maybe they have more 7s than I thought. If I don't have enough to support a higher bid, challenging might be the safer option. \n\nI think challenging is the way to go here because I don't have enough 7s to back a higher bid, and the risk of the bid being false is worth taking. If I'm wrong, I lose, but if I'm right, I win. Given that I only have one 7, and the bid is four, it's possible that Player 0 is bluffing or maybe they have exactly three, making the total four. But without more info, challenging seems like the best move.\n"
