Given typical digit distributions, having 2 or more sevens in a single 8-digit hand is possible but not very likely. The probability decreases as the quantity increases. Since I only have 1 seven, and the total needed is 3, it's a reasonable risk to challenge. Alternatively, I could bid higher, but raising to 4 sevens seems unlikely, and changing to a higher digit with at least 3 counts is risky. Therefore, the optimal move is to challenge the current bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
