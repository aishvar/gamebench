Since I have one, the opponent likely has at least one or is bluffing. Two 9s are quite plausible, so challenging now is risky. To continue the game strategically, I can raise the bid by increasing the digit to 9's next highest digit, or the quantity. Since the current bid is 2 9s, the next valid higher bids could be 2 9s (impossible), 3 9s (unlikely), or 2 0s through 2 9s with a higher digit. The safest incremental bid is 2 9s upgraded to 2 9s or 2 0s, but since digit can't be equal, I must raise quantity or digit. Increasing to 3 3s is reasonable because I have two 3s in my hand, making a total of 3 plausible. Therefore, I will bid 3 3s.\", \"action\": \"BID: 3 3s\"}",
