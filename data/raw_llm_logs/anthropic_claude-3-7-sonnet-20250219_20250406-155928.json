        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

The current bid is \\'2 5s\\', which means Player 0 is claiming there are at least 2 fives in total between our hands. Since I already have 1 five, this claim is very likely to be true - Player 0 would only need to have 1 or more fives in their hand. Given this information, challenging would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s, one 0, one 1, one 6, one 2, and one 5. The most common digit in my hand is 8 (two of them), so I could bid \\'3 8s\\', which would require Player 0 to have at least one 8 to be true. Alternatively, I could play it safer and bid \\'2 6s\\' or \\'2 8s\\', which would be higher than \\'2 5s\\' because of the higher digit. Since I have two 8s in my hand, bidding \\'3 8s\\' seems reasonable.\", \"action\": \"BID: 3 8s\"}', type='text')"
