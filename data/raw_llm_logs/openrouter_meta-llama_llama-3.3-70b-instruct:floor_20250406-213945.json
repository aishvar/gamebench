You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

However, considering the bidding history, the bids have been steadily increasing in either quantity or digit value. Since I don't have enough information to confidently challenge the bid of 3 9s and given that my hand doesn't contain any 9s, making a bid that increases the quantity or digit seems like a strategic move. The next logical step would be to increase the quantity of a lower digit or maintain the same quantity with a higher digit. However, since 9 is the highest digit and we can't exceed the quantity of 3 without more information, the safest increase would be to bid on a digit that is less likely to be challenged immediately, considering the history. Given that we've had bids on 1s and 5s previously, and now on 9s, a bid on a digit not yet mentioned could be wise. However, without specific digits to rely on from my hand, I must consider the likelihood of certain digits appearing. Given the lack of 9s in my hand and the current bid, I should consider challenging or bidding on a less common digit. But, since challenging requires certainty or a strong hunch based on the bids and my hand, and given that the bid of 3 9s might not be extremely high considering two players have 8 digits each, making a strategic bid seems more appropriate. Since I have two 1s and a 6 and a 7, and considering the bids have focused on lower and higher digits, I could try to bid on a digit that hasn't been mentioned but is present in my hand, like 6 or 7, or even consider the 1s since they are the lowest and might be less expected after a bid on 9s. However, bidding on 1s might seem too low after a bid on 9s. Thus, considering all, a reasonable bid could involve increasing the quantity of a digit I have or bidding on a higher digit if I had one. Given the constraints and aiming to keep the bid reasonable and not too risky, bidding on a digit I have more than one of seems prudent.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 1s\"\n}",
