Since I don't have any '0's, I need to either bid a digit that I have in my hand or challenge if I think the bid is too high. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and there are only 8 digits per player, bidding a higher quantity of a digit I have or a higher digit with a reasonable quantity seems strategic. However, without information on Player 0's full hand, I must make an educated guess. I see an opportunity to bid on '2's since I have one '2'. If Player 0 only had 2 '0's as they claimed, my bid could potentially be safe if I have enough of another digit to make a higher claim.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: Q D\"\n}\n```",
