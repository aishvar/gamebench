Therefore, the bid of 1 nine is reasonable, and I should consider making a higher bid. The next valid bid can be either increasing the count to 2 nines or bidding at least 1 zero (since digit order increases). I have one zero in my hand, so bidding 1 zero is safe and a minimal raise.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 1 0s\"\n}",
