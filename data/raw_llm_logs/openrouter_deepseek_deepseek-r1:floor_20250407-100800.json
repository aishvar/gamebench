You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I'm Player 0, and the current bid is None, so I need to make the opening bid. My hand is 2,4,2,9,6,5,9,7. Let me count the digits I have. \n\nLooking at my hand: two 2s, one 4, two 9s, one 6, one 5, and one 7. So the digits in my hand are: 2 (two times), 4, 9 (two times), 6, 5, 7. The most frequent digits here are 2 and 9, each appearing twice. \n\nSince there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total number of digits in the game is 16. As the first bidder, I want to start with a bid that's reasonable based on my hand but also gives me some flexibility. Starting with a higher quantity might be risky because I don't know the opponent's hand. However, since I have two 2s and two 9s, maybe I can base my bid on one of those.\n\nIf I bid on 2s, I have two, so the total possible 2s in the game could be higher if the opponent has some. But starting with a bid of two 2s would be low, but since the current bid is None, any bid is allowed. Wait, but the first bid must be higher than None, which I guess just means any valid bid. So I can start with any quantity and digit.\n\nBut to make a strategic opening bid, I should choose a digit that I have at least one of, and a quantity that's possible but not too high. For example, if I have two 2s, maybe bid two 2s. But maybe the opponent has a couple more, so total could be 3 or 4. But since I need to start, perhaps a bid of two 2s is safe. Alternatively, since 9s are also in my hand twice, maybe bid two 9s. But which digit is higher? 9 is higher than 2, so if I bid two 9s, that might be better because if the opponent has any 9s, the total could be higher, and the next player would have to either increase the quantity or the digit.\n\nWait, but the opening bid can be anything. Let me think: the lowest possible bid is 1 of any digit. But since I have two 2s, maybe starting with something like three 2s. But that's a bid of three 2s, but I only have two. But maybe the opponent has one or two more. So total could be 3 or 4. But if I bid three 2s, that's possible. Alternatively, since I have two 2s, maybe start with two 2s. But the next player can then either increase the quantity or the digit. If I start with two 2s, the next player can bid two 3s or higher, or three of any digit. But if I start with two 9s, which is a higher digit, then the next player has to either bid three of any digit or a higher digit than 9, which is impossible. So the next player would have to increase the quantity if they want to bid on 9s, or switch to a lower digit but with higher quantity. Hmm, but digits can't go higher than 9. So if I bid two 9s, the next player can only increase the quantity or bid a higher quantity on a lower digit. Wait, no. The rules say a bid is higher if the quantity is higher (regardless of digit) or same quantity but higher digit. So, for example, two 9s can be beaten by three of any digit (since 3 > 2), or two 10s, but since digits are 0-9, that's not possible. So the next player would have to bid three of any digit to beat two 9s. Alternatively, they could challenge if they think two 9s is too high.\n\nBut considering that there are 16 total digits, the maximum possible for any digit is 16 (if all digits are the same). But in reality, that's extremely unlikely. So, if I bid two 9s, the opponent might have zero or more 9s. Since I have two, the total could be two plus however many they have. If they have one, total is three. So two 9s is a safe bid because even if they have none, the total is two, which meets the bid. Wait, no: the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So if I bid two 9s, the total must be two or more. Since I have two, even if the opponent has none, total is two, which meets the bid. So that's a safe bid. But if I bid two 9s, and the opponent challenges, they would lose because the total is at least two. So that's a safe opening bid. Alternatively, I could bid higher, like three 9s. But then, if the opponent has none, total is two, which is less than three, so I lose if they challenge. So maybe starting with two 9s is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bid one 9s, but that's lower than two. Since I have two, why not bid two. Alternatively, since the current bid is None, any bid is allowed. So maybe start with two 9s. That way, if the opponent has any 9s, the total is higher, but even if they don't, I'm safe. So that's a solid opening. Alternatively, maybe choose a higher quantity on a lower digit. For example, three 2s. But I have two 2s, so if the opponent has one, total is three. So that's a possible bid. But if they have none, total is two, which is less than three, making the bid invalid. So that's riskier. So maybe two 9s is safer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bid two 5s. I have one 5. If the opponent has one, total is two. But if they have none, total is one, which is less than two. So that's risky. So better to bid on a digit I have more of. So 2s and 9s are better.\n\nBetween 2s and 9s: 9 is a higher digit. So if I bid two 9s, the next player can't bid two of a higher digit (since 9 is the highest), so they have to increase the quantity. So they might bid three of any digit, say three 0s. Then I can decide whether to challenge or bid higher. Alternatively, if they have a lot of a lower digit, they might challenge. But starting with two 9s seems safe because it's based on my own hand, and even if they have none, the bid is still valid. So that's a good opening move.\n"
