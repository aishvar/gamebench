For the bid to be true, the opponent needs at least one 6 in their 8-digit hand, which is statistically plausible (expected value is 0.8). Challenging seems risky.\\n\\nI need to make a higher bid. Options are increasing the quantity (to 3) or keeping the quantity at 2 and increasing the digit (to 7, 8, or 9).\\n\\nLet's consider bids:\\n- '2 7s': I have one 7. Requires opponent to have >=1 seven. Plausible.\\n- '3 0s' to '3 4s', '3 6s', '3 7s': I have one of each (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7). Requires opponent to have >=2 of that digit. Less likely than bids based on my stronger digits.\\n- '3 5s': I have two 5s. This bid requires the opponent to have at least one 5 in their hand. Given I hold two 5s already, claiming a total of three is a strong, credible bid based on my hand. This seems much safer and more likely to be true than challenging '2 6s' or bidding on digits I only have one of.\\n\\nTherefore, bidding '3 5s' is the best strategic move.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 5s\"\n}\n```",
