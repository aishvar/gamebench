        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 4 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '5 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 32 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.",

This means the other 3 players need to have at least 4 more 8s among their 24 digits for the bid to be true. The expected number of 8s across all 32 digits is 3.2, and in the remaining 24 digits, it's 2.4. Requiring 4 more 8s is above average, making a challenge plausible. However, it's not an extremely high bid yet. \\n\\nAlternatively, I can bid higher. A higher bid would be 5 9s or 6+ of any digit. \\n- Bidding 5 9s is risky as I have no 9s.\\n- Bidding 6 of a digit seems better. I have two 1s. Player 3 previously bid 4 1s, suggesting there might be a reasonable number of 1s in play. Bidding 6 1s requires 4 more 1s among the other 24 digits (expected 2.4). Given my hand and Player 3's previous bid, this seems like a reasonably safe and informative bid. It leverages my hand strength in 1s and the history. Bidding 6 4s (I have two 4s) is another option, but lacks the supporting bid history that 1s have. Bidding 6 8s seems counterintuitive as I only have one 8 and would be raising a bid that already seems slightly high.\\n\\nComparing challenging 5 8s vs. bidding 6 1s: Bidding 6 1s feels like a stronger move. It uses information from my hand and the game history, puts pressure on the next player (Player 3, who previously bid on 1s), and avoids potentially challenging a bid that might just be true.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 6 1s\"\n}\n```",
