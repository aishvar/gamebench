Since my hand contains 3 zeros, which is less than the current bid of 4 zeros, and I need to make a valid higher bid or challenge, I should consider if I can make a higher bid or if challenging is more strategic. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and I have 3 zeros, I can see there's a possibility the other player might have more zeros or I could bid on a different digit. However, bidding on a higher quantity of a different digit might be risky without knowing the other player's hand. I notice that I have 2 sevens, which could be a strategic bid. The current bid is 4 of a digit (0) that I have 3 of, so I should consider bidding on a digit I have more of or think is less likely for the other player to have in high quantity. Since I have 2 sevens and no information suggests the other player has many sevens, I could make a bid of '5 7s' as it could be a strategic move to increase the quantity or digit.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: Q D\"\n}\n```",
