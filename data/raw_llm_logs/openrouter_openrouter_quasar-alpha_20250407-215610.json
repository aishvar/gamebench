Since I hold zero 6s, all three must be in the opponent's hand. While it's possible, it's somewhat unlikely given only 8 digits. The earlier bid history shows the opponent favoring 6s and me favoring 7s, with the opponent pushing the count from 1 to 3 sixes. Given the low probability of the opponent having 3 sixes and my zero, challenging is strategically sound. A higher bid on 7s (3 7s) is risky since I have zero 7s as well, and it would be a bluff. Therefore, the best move is to challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
