Since each player has 8 digits, it's possible but somewhat unlikely that Player 1 has exactly two or more '9's. However, with only one '9' on my side, calling a challenge might be risky at this stage because three total '9's is plausible. A safer move is to increase the bid modestly, both to apply pressure and to gather more information. The next minimal legal bid is 3 '9's to 3 '9's +1 digit up, or 4 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have two '5's, so bidding 3 '5's is invalid (lower than previous bids), but I can bid 4 '5's, leveraging the two '5's I hold. This is a reasonable next bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 5\"\n}",
