You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

They might try to increase the quantity or the digit. However, since the maximum quantity is 16 and the bid is 4, I need to assess the likelihood of there being at least 4 5s. My hand has one, so the opponent would need at least three 5s. Considering their previous bid of 3 6s, they might not have many 5s. But since they increased the bid to 4 5s, they might be bluffing. Alternatively, they could have multiple 5s. To challenge, I need to be confident that the total 5s are less than 4. If I have one, and assuming they have two, that's three total, which would make the bid invalid. But without knowing their hand, it's risky. Alternatively, I could bid higher. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity to 5 5s or change the digit to a higher one with the same quantity. Since my hand has a 9, maybe bidding 4 9s. But do I have enough 9s? I have one 9. If I bid 4 9s, the total would need to be at least four. If the opponent has none, and I have one, that's only one, which is not enough. So that's a bad bid. Alternatively, increase the quantity to 5 5s. But if I only have one, the opponent would need four, which is unlikely. Alternatively, same quantity, higher digit. 4 6s. But the opponent had 3 6s before. If they had three 6s, then 4 6s would be possible if I have one. Wait, my hand is 84905629. So my digits are 8,4,9,0,5,6,2,9. So I have one 6. If the opponent has three 6s, total would be four. But the opponent's previous bid was 3 6s, which I countered with 4 5s. So maybe they don't have three 6s. If they had three 6s, they might have stuck with 3 6s or increased to 4 6s. Instead, they increased the quantity of 5s. So perhaps they have multiple 5s. But I have one 5. If they have two 5s, total is three, which is less than 4. So their bid of 4 5s would be invalid. Therefore, challenging might be a good move here. Alternatively, if I can make a higher bid that's safer. Let's see. What digits do I have multiple of? I have two 9s. So maybe bidding 4 9s. But I only have two 9s. The opponent would need to have two 9s as well to make four. That's possible, but risky. Alternatively, bid 5 9s. That's even riskier. Alternatively, look for a digit where I have more. I have one 8, one 4, two 9s, one 0, one 5, one 6, one 2. So the 9s are my strongest. But even with two 9s, the opponent might not have any. So 4 9s would require them to have two, which is uncertain. Alternatively, maybe the opponent's hand has some obvious digits. Wait, the opponent is Player 0, whose hand is unknown. Since the bid is 4 5s, and I have one 5, the opponent must have at least three 5s for the bid to be valid. But if they had three 5s, why would they bid 3 6s earlier? Maybe they were bluffing then. It's possible they have a mix. This is getting complicated. Given the uncertainty, challenging might be better. If I challenge and the total 5s are three or less, I win. If it's four or more, I lose. Since I have one, the opponent needs three. Considering they bid 4 5s, they might have two or three. If they have two, total is three, and I win the challenge. If they have three, total is four, and they win. It's a 50-50 chance. Alternatively, making a higher bid. Let's think of a safe higher bid. The current bid is 4 5s. To make a higher bid, I can do 5 5s (risky), 4 6s, 4 7s, etc. If I bid 4 6s, the total 6s must be at least four. I have one 6. The opponent needs three. If they had three 6s, their previous bid of 3 6s would have been honest, and then they might have increased to 4 6s. But instead, they increased the 5s. So maybe they don't have three 6s. Therefore, bidding 4 6s might be risky. Alternatively, 4 7s. I have no 7s. The opponent would need four 7s. That's very unlikely. So that's a bad bid. Alternatively, 4 8s. I have one 8. Opponent needs three. Unlikely. 4 9s, as before. Hmm. Alternatively, increasing the quantity to 5. Bidding 5 5s. If I have one, opponent needs four. Very unlikely. So that's a bluff. But if I'm caught, I lose. Alternatively, maybe the opponent will challenge me. This is tricky. Given the options, challenging the current bid might be the safest move, even if it's a 50-50 chance. Because if I bid higher and get challenged, I might lose. Alternatively, if I can make a bid that's more likely to be true. Wait, my hand has two 9s. What's the total number of 9s? I have two. If the opponent has two, total is four. So bidding 4 9s would be a good move. But I don't know their 9s. If they have zero, then total is two, which is less than four. So that's a bad bid. But if they have one, total is three. Still less. So unless they have two, the bid fails. So it's risky. Alternatively, maybe they have some 9s. But there's no way to know. Given the uncertainty, perhaps challenging is better. I'll go with challenging the 4 5s bid, hoping that the opponent doesn't have three 5s. Since they increased from 3 5s to 4 5s, maybe they're bluffing, thinking I have none. But I have one. So total would be their 5s plus one. If they have two, total is three. So the bid is invalid. Therefore, challenging is a good move.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
