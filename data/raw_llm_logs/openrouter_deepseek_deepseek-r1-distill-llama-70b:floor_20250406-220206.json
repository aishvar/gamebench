You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let me try to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker situation. So, I'm Player 1, and the current bid is 2 7s from Player 0. My hand is 59049284. I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge.\n\nFirst, I should look at my own hand to see how many 7s I have. Let me count each digit: 5, 9, 0, 4, 9, 2, 8, 4. Hmm, I don't see any 7s there. So I have zero 7s. That means whatever Player 0 bid, the total number of 7s in both hands can't be more than whatever they have, but since I have none, it's all on them.\n\nThe current bid is 2 7s. If I challenge, we'll see how many 7s are actually there. If the total is less than 2, I win. If it's 2 or more, Player 0 wins. Since I have zero, Player 0 must have at least 2 for the bid to be valid. But do they?\n\nI don't know Player 0's hand, but I can think about probabilities. Each player has 8 digits, so there are 16 digits in total. The chance that Player 0 has 2 or more 7s is possible, but not guaranteed. However, since the bid is low (only 2), it's more likely they might have that. But maybe they're bluffing.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to bid higher. Since the current bid is 2 7s, I need to bid a higher quantity or same quantity but higher digit. But looking at my hand, I have two 9s, two 4s, and one each of 5, 0, 2, 8. So maybe I can bid on 9s. I have two, so if I bid 3 9s, that might be a good move. But wait, I only have two, so if I bid 3, I'm assuming Player 0 has at least one 9. Do I think they have any?\n\nPlayer 0's hand isn't visible, but considering the digits, it's possible they could have a 9 or not. If I bid 3 9s and they don't have any, then the total would be just 2, which is less than my bid, and I'd lose if challenged. So that's risky.\n\nAnother option is to bid a higher digit with the same quantity. For example, since 7s are the current digit, I could bid 2 8s or 2 9s. Let's see: I have one 8 and two 9s. If I bid 2 8s, the total would be my one plus whatever Player 0 has. If they have at least one 8, then it's valid. But if they have none, then the total is just one, which is less than 2, making the bid invalid.\n\nSimilarly, for 9s, I have two. If I bid 2 9s, the total would be two plus however many Player 0 has. If they have any, it's valid. But if they have none, it's exactly two, which matches the bid. So, in that case, it's still valid.\n\nWait, so if I bid 2 9s, the total is at least two, which meets the bid. So that could be a safe move because even if Player 0 has zero 9s, the bid is still correct. That seems like a good option because it's a minimal increase in the bid, both in quantity and digit, and I have a solid foundation with my two 9s.\n\nAlternatively, I could challenge the 2 7s bid. Since I have zero 7s, if Player 0 has less than two, I win. But if they have exactly two or more, I lose. Considering that 7s aren't that common, maybe Player 0 is bluffing. But it's a low bid, so they might actually have it.\n\nI think bidding 2 9s is safer because I know I have two, so the total can't be less than two. It's a sure thing, whereas challenging is risky because I don't know Player 0's hand. Plus, making a bid keeps the game going, and I can control the next move.\n\nSo, I'll go with bidding 2 9s. It's a valid higher bid, and I have the digits to back it up, making it a strong move without taking on too much risk.\n"
