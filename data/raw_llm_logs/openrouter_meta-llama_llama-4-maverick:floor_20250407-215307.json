Since there are 2 players and each has 8 digits, the total number of digits is 16. The probability of having more than 3 zeros is low because the expected number of zeros is 1.6 (16 * 0.1). However, the bid of 3 0s is not extremely high. I need to consider my own hand and the fact that the opponent has already made a bid on zeros, indicating they might have some. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or change the digit. Increasing the quantity to 4 0s seems too high given my hand and the likelihood. I can bid on a different digit that is more common in my hand. I have 1 '1', 1 '2', 1 '3', 1 '5', 1 '7', 1 '8', and 2 '9's. The digit '9' is the most frequent in my hand. The current bid is on '0's, so I can bid on '9's or increase the count of another digit. Since there's already a bid on '1's (2 1s was my last bid), I can consider bidding on '9's or another digit that hasn't been bid on recently. Bidding 2 '9's would be a valid move as it exceeds the current bid by changing the digit and is a reasonable count given my hand and the possibility that the other player might also have '9's.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 9\"\n}\n```",
