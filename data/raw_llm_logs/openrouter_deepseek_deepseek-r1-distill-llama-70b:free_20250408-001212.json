        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 1s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, the current bid is 4 1s, made by Player 0. My hand is 24563148. I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have the digits 2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 1, 4, 8. So, I have one '1' in my hand. That means Player 0 is claiming that there are at least four '1's in total between both players. Since I only have one, Player 0 must have at least three '1's for the bid to be valid. \n\nNow, thinking about the previous bids, the bidding went like this:\n- Player 0 bid 2 1s\n- I bid 2 4s\n- Player 0 upped it to 3 1s\n- I went to 3 4s\n- Then Player 0 went to 4 1s\n\nI know that in my hand, I have two '4's. So, when I bid 3 4s, I was hoping that the total would be at least three. Since Player 0 then went back to 4 1s, maybe they're trying to push the bid higher on a digit they have more of.\n\nI need to assess whether 4 1s is a plausible bid. I have one '1', so Player 0 must have three. Is that possible? Each player has 8 digits, so Player 0 could have three '1's. But is it likely? Maybe, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to make a higher bid. The current bid is 4 1s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the next digit after 1 is 2, but I don't have many 2s\u2014only one. So, maybe increasing the quantity. But 4 is already the current quantity. The next would be 5. But I don't have enough of any digit to feel confident about that.\n\nWait, I have two '4's. If I were to bid on '4's, I could go to 4 4s. That would be a higher bid than 4 1s because the digit is higher. So, '4 4s' would be a valid higher bid.\n\nBut do I think there are four '4's in total? I have two, so Player 0 would need to have two as well. Is that possible? It's possible, but I'm not certain. If I make that bid, and it's challenged, I could lose if the total is less than four.\n\nAlternatively, I could challenge the current bid of 4 1s. If I challenge, and the total number of '1's is less than four, I win. Since I have one, Player 0 needs to have three. If they have three, the bid is good, and I lose. But if they have two or fewer, I win.\n\nI'm not sure. Maybe I should consider the probabilities. Each player has 8 digits, so there are 16 in total. The chance that Player 0 has three '1's is possible, but not guaranteed. But without more information, it's hard to tell.\n\nIf I challenge and lose, I lose the game. If I make a bid and it's accepted, the game continues. Alternatively, if I make a bid that's too high, I could be setting myself up to be challenged.\n\nAnother thought: since the previous bids went up to 3 4s from me, and then Player 0 went to 4 1s, maybe they're confident in their '1's. Maybe they have three '1's, which would make the total four.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're bluffing, trying to make me think they have more '1's than they do.\n\nI think I have to decide between challenging or bidding. If I challenge, it's a 50-50 guess. If I bid, I might be able to continue the game, but I risk being challenged if my bid is too high.\n\nGiven that I have two '4's, I could try bidding 4 4s. That would be a higher bid than 4 1s because 4 is higher than 1. So, 'BID: 4 4s' would be a valid move. \n\nBut I'm not sure if there are four '4's in total. I have two, so Player 0 would need two as well. It's possible, but I don't know. If I make this bid, and the opponent challenges, I might lose if the total is less than four.\n\nAlternatively, if I challenge the 4 1s, and there are indeed four, I lose. But if there are only three or fewer, I win.\n\nI think challenging might be safer because if I'm wrong, I lose, but if I'm right, I win. On the other hand, bidding might keep the game going, but with the risk of being challenged later.\n\nWait, another angle: since the previous bids went up to 3 4s, and then Player 0 went to 4 1s, maybe they are trying to avoid the '4's because they don't have enough. So, perhaps there aren't four '4's, which would mean my bid of 4 4s might be too high.\n\nSo, if I bid 4 4s and it's challenged, I might lose. Therefore, maybe challenging the 4 1s is better because I have more confidence that there aren't four '1's.\n\nBut I only have one '1', so Player 0 would need three. I don't know their hand, but three '1's is possible. Maybe they have three, maybe not.\n\nI'm torn. On one hand, challenging could end the game in my favor if I'm right. On the other hand, bidding could keep the game going, but with risks.\n\nI think I'll go with challenging because I don't have enough information to make a confident higher bid, and the current bid seems a bit high. Maybe Player 0 is bluffing.\n"
