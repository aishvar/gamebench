For the total to be at least 2 zeros, the opponent would need to have both zeros, which is plausible but not guaranteed. Since zeros are relatively rare and I have none, challenging here is reasonable. Alternatively, I can make a safe higher bid based on digits I do have. Notably, I have two 8s and two 9s. Therefore, bidding 3 of a digit I have multiple of is safer than challenging now. I have two 8s, so a bid of 3 8s is plausible. However, since I only have two 8s, and the opponent would need at least one more 8, which is likely, bidding 3 8s is a reasonable next step.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 8\"\n}",
