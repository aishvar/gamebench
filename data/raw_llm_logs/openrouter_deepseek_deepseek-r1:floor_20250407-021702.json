You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. It's the start of the game, and the current bid is None, so I need to make the first bid. My hand is 68545034. Let me count the digits I have. \n\nLooking at each digit: 6, 8, 5, 4, 5, 0, 3, 4. So, let's tally them up. \n\n0: 1\n3: 1\n4: 2\n5: 2\n6: 1\n8: 1\n\nSo the most frequent digits in my hand are 4 and 5, each appearing twice. Since I'm making the first bid, I want to start with a reasonable bid that's not too high but also gives me some leverage. Maybe start by bidding on one of the digits I have more of. \n\nBidding on 2 of either 4s or 5s would be a start. But since there are two players, each with 8 digits, there are 16 digits total. The opponent could have more of the same digit. If I bid 2 5s, the opponent might have up to 4 more 5s (if they have, say, 5s in all their 8 digits, but that's unlikely). But realistically, starting with a lower bid is safer. \n\nAlternatively, starting with a higher digit but lower quantity. For example, 1 8. But since the first bid has to be strictly higher than None, which is considered as 0 of any digit. So any bid is valid here. But the strategy is to start with a bid that's likely to be true but also allows the opponent to either have to bid higher or challenge. \n\nSince I have two 5s, maybe bid 2 5s. But wait, the initial bid can be any quantity and digit. But maybe a better approach is to bid a lower quantity but higher digit. For example, 1 8. But I have one 8. The opponent might have more. But since 8 is a high digit, if I bid 1 8, the next player can raise by either increasing the quantity (like 2 8s) or same quantity but higher digit (but 9 is higher than 8, but 0 is lower, so they can't go higher digit unless they go to 9, but if they don't have 9s, they might have to increase quantity. Wait, the digits are 0-9, so 9 is the highest. So if I bid 1 8, the next player can either bid 2 8s or 1 9. If they don't have 9s, they might have to challenge or bid higher quantity. But since I have one 8, and the total possible 8s could be up to 8 in the opponent's hand plus mine (but that's 9, but each player has 8 digits, so maximum 8+1=9? Wait, no, each player has 8 digits. So total digits in play are 16. So the maximum possible for any digit is 16. But realistically, starting with 2 5s seems safer. Because I have two, so there's a chance the opponent has at least one more, making the total 3. So if I bid 2 5s, the opponent might have to bid 3 5s or higher. Alternatively, they could challenge. But since it's the first bid, challenging is unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower digit but higher quantity. Like 3 0s. But I have one 0. The opponent could have more. But 3 might be possible. Hmm. \n\nWait, the key is to start with a bid that's likely to be true, but also gives me room to maneuver. Since I have two 5s, and two 4s, maybe start with 2 5s. Because if the opponent has even one 5, the total is 3, so the bid would be valid. But if they have none, then the total is 2, which matches my bid. Wait, the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So if I bid 2 5s, and the total is exactly 2, then it's still valid. So even if the opponent has zero 5s, my bid is correct. Because 2 (my) + 0 (theirs) = 2, which meets the bid of 2. So that's safe. But if I bid 3 5s, then if the opponent has zero, the total is 2, which is less than 3, so that would be a losing bid if challenged. \n\nTherefore, the safest first bid would be to bid the number of a digit that I have, but with the quantity equal to my count. Because that way, even if the opponent has none, the total is exactly my count, so the bid is valid. So for example, I have two 5s. If I bid 2 5s, then even if the opponent has none, the total is 2, which meets the bid. So that's a safe bid. But the problem is that the next player can then bid higher, either in quantity or digit. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 5s, the opponent can bid 2 6s (higher digit) or 3 of any digit. But if they bid 2 6s, and I have one 6, then the total would be at least 1 (mine) plus whatever they have. If they have, say, one 6, then total is 2, which meets their bid. But if they have none, then the total is 1, which is less than 2, so their bid would be invalid. \n\nBut since it's the first move, maybe the best approach is to bid the highest possible safe bid. So, since I have two 5s and two 4s, maybe bid 2 5s. Alternatively, bid 2 4s. But 5 is a higher digit than 4, so if I bid 2 5s, that's a higher bid than 2 4s. So starting with a higher digit might be better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 1 8. I have one 8. If I bid 1 8, then the total could be 1 (if opponent has none) up to 9 (if opponent has 8 8s). But since the opponent has 8 digits, the maximum they can have is 8. So total possible 8s is 1 (mine) + up to 8 (theirs) = 9. But the bid is 1, which is safe. Then the next player can bid higher, like 2 8s or 1 9. But if they don't have any 9s, they might have to bid higher quantity. \n\nBut starting with a higher digit might be better because it forces the opponent to either bid higher quantity or a higher digit, which could be harder. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the opponent has 8 digits, the probability that they have at least one of a certain digit is higher. For example, if I have two 5s, maybe the opponent has at least one, making the total 3. So bidding 3 5s could be possible. But if they have none, then the total is 2, which is less than 3, so that's risky. \n\nBut since it's the first bid, perhaps it's better to start with a conservative bid. So maybe bid 2 5s, as that's safe (since even if opponent has none, total is 2). Alternatively, bid 1 8s, which is also safe (since I have one). But which is better? \n\nBidding 2 5s is a higher quantity but same digit. Wait, no, the first bid is None, so any bid is allowed. The question is, what's the best opening move. \n\nIn many Liar's Poker strategies, starting with a bid that's close to the expected average can be good. The total number of each digit across all players is 16 (each player has 8 digits). So the average per digit is 1.6 (16/10 digits). But that's just the average. \n\nBut since I have two 5s, maybe the opponent has some. So bidding 2 5s is safe. Alternatively, I can bid 3 5s, but that's risky. \n\nWait, if I bid 2 5s, and the opponent has none, the total is 2, which meets the bid. So it's safe. If the opponent has at least one, then the total is 3 or more. So bidding 2 5s is a safe opening move. Then the opponent has to bid higher. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 1 8, which is safe, but the opponent can bid 1 9 (if they have any 9s) or higher quantity. But since I don't know their hand, maybe starting with a higher quantity on a digit I have more of is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 3 0s. I have one 0. The opponent could have two, making the total 3. But that's a risk. But if I bid 3 0s, and the opponent has two, then total is 3. So it's valid. But if they have none, then total is 1, which is less than 3. So that's a bad bid. \n\nSo perhaps the safest opening bid is to bid exactly the number I have in my hand for a digit. So for example, 2 5s. That way, even if the opponent has none, the total is 2, so the bid is valid. Then the opponent has to bid higher. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 5s, the opponent can bid 2 6s (higher digit) or 3 of any digit. If they bid 2 6s, then I can challenge if I think they don't have enough 6s. But I have one 6 in my hand. So if they bid 2 6s, the total would be at least 1 (mine) plus theirs. If they have one, then total is 2, which meets the bid. If they have none, total is 1, which is less. So if they bid 2 6s, I might have to consider challenging. \n\nBut back to the opening bid. The safest approach is to bid the quantity equal to the number I have in my hand for a particular digit, ensuring that even if the opponent has none, the bid is valid. \n\nLooking at my hand again: two 5s, two 4s, one 0, one 3, one 6, one 8. \n\nSo possible bids:\n\n- 2 5s: safe, as total >=2.\n- 2 4s: same logic.\n- 1 8s: safe, but lower quantity.\n\nBetween 2 5s and 2 4s, since 5 is a higher digit, bidding 2 5s is better because it's a higher bid. That way, the opponent has to bid a higher quantity or a higher digit. \n\nFor example, if I bid 2 5s, the next possible bids are:\n\n- 3 of any digit (e.g., 3 0s)\n- 2 of a higher digit (e.g., 2 6s, 2 7s, etc.)\n\nSo starting with 2 5s seems reasonable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 1 8, which is a higher digit but lower quantity. But the opponent might have to respond with 2 8s or 1 9. If they have a 9, they can bid 1 9, but if not, they have to increase the quantity. \n\nBut since 8 is a high digit, and I have one, maybe that's a good opening. But the quantity is lower. \n\nIn terms of game strategy, starting with a higher quantity on a mid-digit might be better. So 2 5s is better than 1 8. \n\nSo I think the best move is to bid 2 5s.\n"
