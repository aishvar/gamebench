For the bid of 3 sixes to be valid, there need to be at least two sixes in the opponent's hand. While this is possible, the probability is moderate. Given that the bid history shows incremental increases without jumping to 4 of any digit, the opponent might be bluffing or pushing the limit. Since I only hold one '6', and 3 sixes overall is plausible but not guaranteed, challenging here puts pressure on the opponent's bid credibility. Therefore, challenging is the optimal move.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
