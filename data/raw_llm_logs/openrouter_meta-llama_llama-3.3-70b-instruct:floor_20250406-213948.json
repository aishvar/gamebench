You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

Considering the bid history, the bids have been increasing in quantity or digit value. Since I only have one 3, bidding higher on 3s might be risky. However, I can try to increase the digit value while keeping the quantity the same as the current bid or increase the quantity with a lower digit. Given my hand does not offer a clear advantage in any specific digit to safely increase the quantity, I should look for a digit that could potentially be abundant enough to make a reasonable bid. Noticing my hand has two 0s and considering the history where 4 0s was a previous bid, it seems plausible that there could be enough 0s to make a bid of the same quantity as the current bid but with a higher digit unlikely to succeed. Thus, challenging the current bid might be the safer option, but let's consider the potential for a higher digit bid first. Since my hand doesn't strongly support a higher bid in any digit without risking a challenge, and given the bids have been strategic, I must weigh the risk of my next bid being challenged against the potential gain. The presence of two 0s in my hand suggests that bidding on 0s could be viable, but the last bid on 0s was 4 0s, and I'm not confident in increasing this further without more information. Given this analysis, making a bid that increases either the quantity or the digit from the current 5 3s, while considering the risk of a challenge, seems necessary. However, my hand does not provide a clear path to safely increase the bid without risking a challenge, suggesting that challenging might be a viable option if I believe the current bid is unlikely. Considering all factors, including the bid history and my hand, I must decide whether to challenge the bid of 5 3s or attempt to make a higher bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
