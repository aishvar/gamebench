I have zero 8s. For the current bid to be true, Player 0 must hold at least two 8s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, challenging this early on a low bid is risky. A better strategy is to make a higher bid based on my hand. I have strong counts of 0s (two) and 9s (two). Bidding '2 9s' would be a safe, truthful bid, as I hold two 9s myself. However, a slightly more assertive bid leveraging my count is preferable. Bidding '3 0s' is a valid higher bid (quantity increases). I hold two 0s, meaning this bid is true if the opponent has at least one 0 among their 8 digits. Statistically, it's likely the opponent has at least one 0 (expected value is 0.8). Therefore, bidding '3 0s' is a reasonably safe bid that increases the pressure.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 0s\"\n}\n```",
