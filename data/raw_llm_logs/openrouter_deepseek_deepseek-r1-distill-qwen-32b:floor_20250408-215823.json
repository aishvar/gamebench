You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let's see, the current bid is 4 7s from Player 0. My hand is 29906984, which I can look at to see how many 7s I have. Let me count the digits: 2, 9, 9, 0, 6, 9, 8, 4. Hmm, I don't see any 7s in my hand. So, if I'm the one to act next, I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid.\n\nIf I challenge, we'll reveal the total number of 7s. Since I have zero, the total can't be more than what Player 0 has. But I don't know how many 7s Player 0 has. They could have up to four, but that's unlikely because each player only has eight digits. So, if they have four 7s, that's a lot. But maybe they're lying.\n\nAlternatively, I could make a higher bid. The next bid has to be higher in quantity or same quantity but higher digit. So, if I bid 5 7s, that's higher in quantity. But I don't have any 7s, so I'm not sure if that's a good idea. Or I could bid 4 8s, which is the same quantity but higher digit. That might be safer because I don't have any 7s, but I have an 8. Wait, I have one 8. So, if I bid 4 8s, I'm saying there are at least four 8s in total. But I only have one, so I'm hoping Player 0 doesn't have three more. That seems risky.\n\nAnother option is to bid 4 9s. I have three 9s, so that's a strong position. If I bid 4 9s, I'm saying there are at least four 9s. Since I have three, Player 0 would need to have at least one more. That might be a good bid because they might not have enough 9s to meet the bid.\n\nWait, but the current bid is 4 7s. So, to make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. If I go higher in quantity, like 5 7s, but I don't have any, so that's a risk. If I go higher in digit, like 4 8s, that's possible but I only have one. Alternatively, I could bid 4 9s, which is a higher digit than 7, and I have three, so maybe that's a better move.\n\nBut I also need to consider what Player 0 might have. If they bid 4 7s, maybe they have some 7s, but maybe not. If I challenge, and they have at least four, I lose. If they don't, I win. But without knowing, it's a gamble. On the other hand, making a higher bid could be safer if I have a good hand.\n\nLooking at my hand again, I have three 9s. That's a strong position for 9s. So, if I bid 4 9s, it's likely that the total is at least four because I have three, and Player 0 might have one. That seems reasonable. Plus, it's a higher digit than 7, so it's a valid bid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 5 9s, but that's a higher quantity, and I'm not sure if Player 0 has that many. They might only have one or two. So, 4 9s seems like a safe and valid bid.\n\nWait, but the current bid is 4 7s. If I bid 4 9s, that's a higher digit, so it's a valid higher bid. Yes, that works. So, I think I should make a bid of 4 9s because I have three, and it's a higher digit, making it a valid move. Plus, it's a safer bet because I have more 9s than 7s.\n"
