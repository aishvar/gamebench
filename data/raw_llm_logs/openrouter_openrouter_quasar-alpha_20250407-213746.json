No digit appears more than once, so no strong bias towards any digit. Statistically, with 16 digits total, each digit should appear roughly 1-2 times. It's common to open with a bid of 2 of a digit I have, as it's a safe and reasonable starting point. I will choose '2' of the digit '3' (which I hold), making a minimal but valid opening bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 3\"\n}",
