You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. Let me think through this step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the game state. My hand is 76564197. Let me count the digits I have. Breaking it down: 7,6,5,6,4,1,9,7. So I have two 7s, two 6s, one 5, one 4, one 1, and one 9. \n\nSince the current bid is None, I need to make the first bid. The rules say that each bid has to be higher than the previous one, either in quantity or digit. But since there's no previous bid, I can start with any quantity and digit, but it's usually strategic to start low to avoid being challenged early.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 7s. Maybe I can bid on 7s. But if I bid 2 7s, that's a low bid, but considering the total possible digits across both players is 16, it's possible that the total number of 7s could be higher. Alternatively, I could bid on a higher digit to set a trend towards higher digits, making future bids harder for the opponent.\n\nWait, but starting too high might be risky. If I bid 3 9s, that's a higher digit, but I only have one 9. The opponent might have none or one, making the total 2, which would make my bid of 3 invalid. So that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit that's more common. Looking at my hand, 6 appears twice. Maybe I can bid 2 6s. But if I do that, the opponent might easily increase the quantity or the digit. \n\nWait, another thought: since I have two 7s, maybe I can bid 3 7s. That way, even if the opponent has one 7, the total would be 3, making my bid valid. But I'm not sure if the opponent has any 7s. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a lower digit to control the game. For example, bidding 4 5s. Since I have one 5, maybe the opponent has a few. But if I bid 4, and the opponent has none, the total would be 1, which is less than 4, so I would lose if challenged.\n\nHmm, maybe starting with a moderate bid is better. Let's think about the digits. I have two 7s, two 6s. Maybe I can bid 2 7s. That's a reasonable starting point. But since it's the first bid, it's better to make it a bit higher to encourage the opponent to bid higher. Maybe 3 7s. If the opponent has at least one 7, the total would be 3, making my bid valid. If not, the total would be 2, and if they challenge, I lose. But since it's the first bid, maybe it's better to take a calculated risk.\n\nWait, another angle: in Liar's Poker, the first bid sets the tone. A low bid might encourage the opponent to bid higher, but a higher bid might make them think twice. I have two 7s, so if I bid 3 7s, I'm assuming the opponent has at least one 7. If they don't, I'm in trouble. But if they do, I'm safe. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I don't have, but that's risky. For example, bidding 1 0s. But I have no 0s, so if the opponent has none, I lose. That's too risky.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think bidding 3 7s is a good starting point. It's a moderate bid, and if the opponent has at least one 7, it's valid. Plus, it sets a higher digit, which might make the opponent think twice before increasing it further. \n\nWait, but another thought: if I bid 3 7s, the opponent might respond with 3 8s or higher, which could be a problem. But since I'm starting, I have to set the bar. Maybe 3 7s is a solid opening bid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 8s, but I don't have any 8s. That's a bad idea because if the opponent challenges, I lose immediately.\n\nSo, going back, I think 3 7s is the way to go. It's a reasonable bid based on my hand, and it gives me a chance to control the game flow.\n"
