Looking at my hand (9, 4, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 0), I have zero 3s. Since I hold half the digits and have none, Player 0 would need to have both 3s in their hand to make the bid valid. While possible, it's somewhat unlikely given the distribution of digits. However, it's not improbable enough to confidently challenge yet. Instead, I can safely raise the bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, which is a minimal and strategic increase. The next valid minimal bid would be 2 4s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 4s\"\n}",
