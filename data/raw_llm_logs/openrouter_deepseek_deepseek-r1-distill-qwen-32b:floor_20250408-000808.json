        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge this bid.\n\nFirst, I'll look at my hand: 75291832. Let me count the digits I have. There's a 7, 5, 2, 9, 1, 8, 3, and 2. So, I have two 2s. That's the only digit I have two of. The other digits appear only once each.\n\nThe current bid is 2 6s. Since I don't have any 6s, I need to consider the likelihood that there are at least two 6s in the combined hands of both players. Each player has 8 digits, so there are 16 digits in total. \n\nGiven that I have no 6s, the only possible 6s are in Player 0's hand. Player 0 could have up to 8 digits, but it's unlikely they have two 6s unless they're trying to bluff. However, in Liar's Poker, players often try to bluff, so it's a bit of a gamble.\n\nIf I challenge the bid, we'll reveal the actual count of 6s. If there are fewer than two, I win. If there are two or more, Player 0 wins. Considering that I have no 6s, the chance that Player 0 has two 6s is low, but not impossible. \n\nAlternatively, I could try to make a higher bid. The next possible bid after 2 6s would be either 3 6s or 2 7s (since 7 is higher than 6). However, I don't have any 7s, so bidding 2 7s might be risky if Player 0 has a 7. Bidding 3 6s is also risky because I have no information about Player 0's hand.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, challenging the bid seems like a safer option. Since I have no 6s, the chances of Player 0 having at least two are lower, especially considering the total of 16 digits. It's a calculated risk, but it feels like a better move than potentially bluffing with a higher bid I can't back up.\n"
