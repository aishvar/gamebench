You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to decide my first move in this Liar's Poker game. The current bid is None, so I have to make the first bid. My hand is 19057686. Let me look at the digits I have.\n\nFirst, I'll list out my digits: 1, 9, 0, 5, 7, 6, 8, 6. Let me count each digit:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 1\n- 5: 1\n- 6: 2 (since there are two 6s)\n- 7: 1\n- 8: 1\n- 9: 1\n\nSo the digits with the highest count in my hand are the 6s, which I have two of. Since it's the first bid, I need to start with a bid that's plausible but maybe not too high. The bid has to be higher than \"None\", so the minimum is 1 of any digit, but obviously you want to set it up so others might have to raise. \n\nBut maybe I should consider what's the best starting bid. The total digits are 16 (8 each), so the maximum possible for any digit is 16. Starting too high might get challenged immediately, but starting low might invite others to bid higher. Since I have two 6s, maybe I can bid 3 6s. That way, if the opponent has at least one 6, the total would be 3. If not, then the bid would be 2, which is below 3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe choosing a higher digit but lower quantity? Wait, the bid needs to be higher than the previous. Since it's the first bid, any bid is acceptable. To maximize my chances, I should pick a digit where I have some, so 6s. Bidding 3 6s. That's a reasonable starting point. \n\nAlternatively, maybe go higher? Like 4, but that might be risky. Since I only have two, but maybe the opponent has two, making it 4. But that's a stretch. Starting with 3 seems safer. Let's go with that. \n\nSo the action would be BID: 3 6s. The reasoning is that I have two 6s, so the total could be 3 if the opponent has one, making the bid valid. It's a reasonable starting bid that's not too high to be challenged immediately.\n"
