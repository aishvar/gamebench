To make a valid bid, I must either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have information about the other player's hand, I will consider the possibility of bidding on a higher digit or a higher quantity of the same digit. However, without knowing the distribution of digits in the other player's hand, challenging the bid might be risky. Given that '2 3s' is a relatively low bid, and considering I only have one '3', I will choose to bid on a higher digit that appears in my hand, which could potentially be a safer move than challenging or bidding higher on '3s'.\", \"action\": \"BID: 2 4s\"}",
