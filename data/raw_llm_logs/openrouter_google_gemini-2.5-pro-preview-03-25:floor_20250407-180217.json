For the current bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least three 1s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, challenging this early feels risky without more information. I have two 3s in my hand. Bidding '3 3s' is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid is statistically strong, as it only requires the opponent to have one 3 among their 8 digits for the bid to be true, which is highly probable. This is a safer move than challenging and shifts the pressure back to Player 0.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 3s\"\n}\n```",
