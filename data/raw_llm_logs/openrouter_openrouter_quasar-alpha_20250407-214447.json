Typically, having 3 of any digit in 8 digits is somewhat rare (~10% chance), so the probability the total is at least 3 is low. Therefore, challenging is strategically sound. Alternatively, bidding 3 6s (since I have one 6) or 4 of any digit would be risky without more evidence. The best move is to challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
