Since I personally hold 3 of the total 3 claimed 3s, the opponent would need to have zero or more 3s to make the bid valid. It's quite plausible that the opponent has at least zero 3s, so the bid of 3 3s is likely valid or at least not obviously false. To continue, I can either increase the quantity or bid a higher digit with the same or higher quantity. Given that I have three 2s in my hand (digits at positions 5, 7, and 8), bidding 3 2s would be lateral and invalid, but bidding 3 4s or 4 3s would be valid. I have one 4, so a safer incremental bid is 4 3s, which increases the quantity by one for the same digit. This is a reasonable next bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 3s\"\n}",
