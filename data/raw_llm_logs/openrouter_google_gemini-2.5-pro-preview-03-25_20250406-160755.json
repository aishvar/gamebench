        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

For the bid to be true, the opponent must have at least three 8s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, this feels like a slightly aggressive bid, especially after they bid 3 4s initially and skipped over 5s, 6s, and 7s (after my 3 7s bid). However, challenging a bid of 3 is still risky early in the game. I have two 7s and two 2s. Bidding 4 7s would build on my previous bid, but Player 0 didn't challenge 3 7s, suggesting they might not have many 7s. Bidding 4 2s seems like a safer option. I have two 2s, so we only need two more 2s from the opponent's 8 digits for the bid to be true. This is statistically plausible (4 out of 16 total digits). It increases the quantity and shifts the digit, putting pressure back on the opponent.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 2s\"\n}\n```",
