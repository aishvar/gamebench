Given the previous bids (2 7s, 2 8s, then 2 9s), Player 0 might be trying to push the bid upwards without necessarily having strong evidence. Since I have no 9s, and two 9s in their hand is a stretch, the probability favors a challenge here rather than risking a higher bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
