        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 3 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 24 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.",

For the bid to be true, the other two players must have at least four 8s combined in their 16 digits. While possible, Player 0's jump from 2 8s to 4 8s after intermediate bids could be a bluff, but also suggests confidence. Challenging feels risky without more information. I need to bid higher than 4 8s. Options are 4 9s or increasing the quantity to 5. I have one 9, so bidding 4 9s requires three more 9s out of 16. Bidding 5 of something seems better. I have two 4s and two 5s. Bidding 5 4s requires three more 4s among the other 16 digits. Bidding 5 5s requires three more 5s. Both are statistically plausible and leverage my hand. Bidding 5 4s seems slightly preferable as 4s haven't been bid yet, whereas I previously bid 3 5s. Bidding 5 4s is a reasonably safe increase based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 5 4s\"\n}\n```",
