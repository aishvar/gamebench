        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn to make a bid. The current bid is None, which means I get to set the starting point. My hand is 90565567. Let me think about what digits I have here.\n\nLooking at my hand: 9, 0, 5, 6, 5, 5, 6, 7. So, I have two 5s, two 6s, and one each of 9, 0, and 7. That's a total of eight digits. Since there are two players, the total number of digits in play is 16.\n\nI need to decide what bid to make. Since the current bid is None, my bid can be anything. I should aim for a bid that's likely to be true but also gives me a strategic advantage. Let me consider the digits I have.\n\nI have two 5s and two 6s. Maybe I can bid on one of those. Let's see, if I bid 2 5s, that's a low bid, but it's safe because I know there are at least two. But maybe I can go higher. What about 3 5s? That would mean I'm claiming there are at least three 5s in total. Since I have two, the opponent would need to have at least one more. But I don't know their hand, so that's a bit risky.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 6s. I have two, so bidding 2 6s is safe. But again, maybe I can go higher. If I bid 3 6s, that's possible if the opponent has one more. But again, uncertain.\n\nAnother approach is to look for digits that are less likely to be in the opponent's hand. For example, I have a 9 and a 0. Maybe I can bid on those. But since I only have one each, bidding on them would require the opponent to have at least one more, which might not be the case.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the most frequent digit in my hand. I have three 5s and two 6s. Wait, no, I have three 5s? Let me recount: 9, 0, 5, 6, 5, 5, 6, 7. So that's three 5s and two 6s. Oh, I miscounted earlier. So I have three 5s, which is a good foundation.\n\nSo, with three 5s in my hand, the total could be three or more. If I bid 3 5s, that's a safe bet because I already have three. The opponent might have zero or more. But if I bid higher, like 4 5s, that would require the opponent to have at least one. But I don't know if they do.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit with a lower quantity. For example, 2 9s. But I only have one 9, so the opponent would need to have at least one more. That's possible, but not certain.\n\nHmm, another thought: since I have three 5s, maybe I can bid 3 5s. That's a solid bid because I know I have three. The opponent might have none, making the total exactly three, which still meets the bid. If they have one or two, the total would be four or five, which is even better. So 3 5s seems like a good starting point.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the problem had a bid of 4 6s when the player had two 6s. So maybe I can do something similar. Since I have three 5s, I can bid 3 5s, which is a valid bid. It's not too high, but it's a good starting point.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 4 5s, hoping the opponent has at least one. But that's riskier. If the opponent has none, the total would be three, which is less than four, and I'd lose if challenged. So maybe it's safer to stick with 3 5s.\n\nAnother option is to bid on a digit I have only one of, but with a higher quantity. For example, 2 9s. But as I thought earlier, that's risky because the opponent might not have any.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the best move is to bid 3 5s. It's a safe bet because I have three, and it's a reasonable starting point. Plus, it's a moderate bid that doesn't overcommit me but still puts pressure on the opponent.\n\nWait, but looking back at my hand, I have three 5s. So, if I bid 3 5s, that's exactly what I have. The opponent could have zero, making the total three. So, the bid would be valid. If they have more, it's even better. So, yes, 3 5s is a solid choice.\n\nI don't see any reason to challenge because there's no previous bid. So, I have to make the first bid. Therefore, I'll go with 3 5s.\n"
