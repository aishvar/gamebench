The probability of having more than one '3' is relatively low because the count of '3's in my hand is 1, and it's unlikely (though possible) that Player 0 has a '3' as well. However, given that the bid is very low (1 3s), it's plausible that the actual count could be higher or at least 1. To make a higher bid, I need to bid on a quantity higher than 1 or the same quantity with a higher digit, or a different quantity with a higher digit is not valid, the quantity must be higher for the same or lower digit.
