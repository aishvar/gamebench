        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 7s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since I don't have any information about Player 0's hand, I need to decide based on my own hand and the bid. Given that my hand contains one 7 and considering the total possible number of 7s could be up to 16 (8 from each player), bidding higher seems plausible. However, without knowing the exact distribution in the other player's hand, it's a bit risky. Since my hand does not contain a high number of any single digit that would comfortably allow me to bid higher with confidence, and considering the bid is relatively low, I should consider challenging if I think the bid is unlikely or try to make a strategic bid. Given the low quantity of the current bid, I can attempt to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 7, increasing the quantity of 7s might not be the best strategy without more information. However, I do have multiple other digits, and increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same could be a viable strategy if I had a digit that appears more frequently in my hand. My hand has two 5s and other digits that appear once. Given this, I could consider bidding on a different digit that appears at least as frequently as the 7 in my hand or try to challenge if I believe the current bid is unlikely.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 8s\"\n}",
