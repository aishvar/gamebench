You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "refusal": null,
                    "reasoning": "Alright, let's see. My hand is 71167033. So I need to count how many of each digit I have. Let's break it down:\n\nDigits in my hand: 7, 1, 1, 6, 7, 0, 3, 3. So counting each:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 2\n- 3: 2\n- 6: 1\n- 7: 2\n\nOkay, so I have two 1s already. The current bid is 2 1s by Player 0. Since I have two 1s, there are 8 digits in my hand and Player 0 also has 8, making 16 total. The bid is 2 1s. So the total 1s could be at least 2 (if Player 0 has none) up to... well, if Player 0 has some 1s. But since the bid is 2, I know I have two, so if I challenge, the actual count would be at least 2. Wait, but the bid is exactly 2, so challenging would result in the count being >=2, meaning the bidder (Player 0) would win. So challenging now would be bad because I know there's at least two 1s. Therefore, I shouldn't challenge. I need to make a higher bid.\n\nNow, the next bid has to be higher than 2 1s. How can I do that? A higher bid can be either a higher quantity with any digit, or the same quantity but a higher digit. So for example, 3 of any digit (since 3 > 2) or 2 of a digit higher than 1. Let's see what digits I can use.\n\nLooking at my hand again, I have two 1s, two 3s, two 7s. So if I bid 2 3s, that's higher than 2 1s because 3 >1. Alternatively, I could bid 3 of any digit. For example, if I have two 7s, maybe there's a chance the opponent has some 7s. But since the current bid is 2 1s, increasing the quantity would be safer. Let's consider possible options.\n\nOption 1: Bid 2 3s. This is valid because 3 is higher than 1, same quantity. But is there a better option? If I can bid 3 of a lower digit, but that's allowed because the quantity is higher. For instance, 3 0s. The quantity is higher (3 >2) so it doesn't matter what the digit is. But do I have any 0s? I have one 0 in my hand. So if I bid 3 0s, maybe the opponent has two 0s, making total 3. But that's a risk. Alternatively, bidding 3 1s would be higher in quantity, but I have two 1s. If the opponent has at least one, then total is 3. But if they have none, then it's 2, which is less than 3, so if I bid 3 1s and someone challenges, I lose. But since I'm Player 1, the next move is mine. Wait, the current bid is 2 1s. If I bid 3 1s, that's a higher quantity. But if the opponent has zero 1s, then total is 2 (my two), so 3 would be a lie. But maybe they have some. Alternatively, maybe bid a higher digit with same quantity. Let's see.\n\nIf I bid 2 3s, that's valid. But if the opponent has none, the total is 2 (my two), so that's exactly the bid. If I bid 2 3s, then the next player could challenge, and if the total is 2, the bidder (me) wins. So that's safe. But perhaps I can go higher. Alternatively, bid 3 of a digit where I have more. For example, I have two 7s. If I bid 3 7s, then the opponent needs to have at least one. Possible, but not certain. But maybe that's a risk. Alternatively, bid 3 0s. I have one 0, so opponent needs two. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, bid 2 7s. That's higher digit than 1s. If I have two 7s, and the opponent has at least one, then total is 3. But if they have none, then it's 2. So 2 7s is a bid that's higher than 2 1s. Then if the opponent challenges, the total would be 2 (if they have none) which is equal to the bid quantity. Wait, but the rule says \"count >= bid quantity\" for the bidder to win. So if I bid 2 7s and the total is exactly 2, then I win. But in this case, the current bid is 2 1s. So if I bid 2 7s, that's a higher digit. Then, if the opponent challenges, and the total is 2, I win. But since I have two 7s, the opponent could have zero, making total 2. So that's safe. So bidding 2 7s is a valid higher bid than 2 1s.\n\nAlternatively, bid 3 of something. Let's say 3 1s. If I have two, opponent needs one. But if they have none, then it's 2, which is less than 3. So that's a risk. Alternatively, 3 3s. I have two, so opponent needs one. Possible. But again, risky.\n\nHmm. So which is safer? Bidding 2 7s is safer because even if the opponent has none, the total is 2, which meets the bid. So that's a guaranteed safe bid. Whereas bidding 3 of any digit could be risky if the opponent doesn't have any. So maybe 2 7s is the best move here. Alternatively, 2 3s. Let me check the digits again.\n\nMy digits: 0,1,1,3,3,6,7,7. So digits I have: 0 (1), 1 (2), 3 (2), 6 (1), 7 (2). So possible higher digits than 1 with same quantity (2) would be 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. But I don't have any 2s,4s,5s,8s,9s. But I have 3s and 7s. So I can bid 2 3s or 2 7s. Both are valid. Which is better?\n\nIf I bid 2 3s, the total could be 2 (if opponent has none) or more. If opponent has at least one, then it's higher. But since the bid is exactly 2, if the total is 2, I win. So that's safe. Same with 2 7s. So either is safe. But maybe choosing a higher digit is better. 7 is higher than 3, so if I bid 2 7s, that's a higher digit than 3. Wait, no, the digit in the bid is 7 vs 3. But the previous bid was 2 1s. So any higher digit with same quantity is acceptable. So 2 3s or 2 7s are both higher than 2 1s. Since 7 is higher than 3, maybe 2 7s is a better bid because it's a higher digit, making it harder for the next player to bid higher without increasing quantity. For example, if I bid 2 7s, the next player can either bid 3 of any digit or bid 2 8s or 9s. But if they don't have any 8s or 9s, they might have to challenge. Alternatively, if I bid 2 3s, the next player could bid 2 4s, 5s, etc., which might be easier if they have those digits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps bidding a higher quantity. Let's say I bid 3 0s. I have one 0. If the opponent has two 0s, total is 3. But if they have none, total is 1. So that's risky. But maybe possible. But since I have only one, it's a gamble. Similarly, 3 1s: I have two, opponent needs one. But if they have none, total is two, which is less than 3. So that's a risky bid.\n\nSo between the safe options: 2 3s or 2 7s. Which is better? Let's think about the opponent's possible hands. Since the opponent (Player 0) bid 2 1s, maybe they have some 1s. But I have two 1s, so the total 1s could be two (if they have none) up to... well, they have 8 digits. If they have, say, three 1s, the total would be five. But their bid was 2 1s, which is low. Maybe they have a couple of 1s. But that's uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, by bidding 2 7s, I'm using a digit that I have two of. If the opponent has any 7s, then the total is higher. If not, it's exactly two, so my bid is valid. So that's a safe move. Therefore, the best action is to bid 2 7s.\n"
