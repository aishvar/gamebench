You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of 2 2s. My hand is 76316902. Let me check the digits I have. Breaking down my hand: 7, 6, 3, 1, 6, 9, 0, 2. So the digits present are 0,1,2,3,6 (twice), 7,9. \n\nThe current bid is 2 2s. To make a valid bid, I need to either increase the quantity to 3 or keep the same quantity but choose a higher digit. Since the digit in the current bid is 2, any digit from 3-9 would be higher. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have one 2. So the total number of 2s between both players could be more. But since I have one, maybe the opponent has none, making the total 1, which is below the current bid. But if I challenge, and the total is less than 2, then the challenger (me) would win. However, if the opponent has a 2, then the bid is valid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should bid higher. Let's see my options. The bid must be higher than 2 2s. So possible bids could be 3 of any digit, or 2 of a digit higher than 2 (like 3,4,...9). \n\nLooking at my hand for high digits: I have a 6 (twice), 7,9. The 9 is the highest digit. If I bid 2 9s, that would be higher in digit than 2 2s. Since I have one 9, maybe the opponent has none. But if I bid 2 9s, I'm claiming there are at least two 9s. Since I only have one, that would be a risk. Alternatively, maybe bid 3 of a lower digit but higher quantity. \n\nWait, another angle: The current bid is 2 2s. If I choose to bid a higher digit with the same quantity, like 2 3s, that's better because 3 is higher than 2. But I have a 3 in my hand. So if I bid 2 3s, that could be safe if I have one and maybe the opponent has another. But maybe that's a good move. Alternatively, 2 6s since I have two 6s. That would make the bid 2 6s, which is higher than 2 2s. Since I have two 6s, even if the opponent has none, the total would be 2, which matches the bid. But the bid must be strictly higher than the previous. Wait, the current bid is 2 2s. If I bid 2 6s, that's same quantity but higher digit, so it's a valid higher bid. That could be a good option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe go for a higher quantity. Like 3 of something. Let's see. The digits I have in quantity: 6 appears twice. If I bid 3 6s, that's a higher quantity. But I only have two, so that's a risk. Alternatively, 3 of a digit I don't have. But that's a lie, but in Liar's Poker, you can bluff. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe challenging is better. Let's think: if the current bid is 2 2s. The total possible 2s could be 0-2 (since I have one, and opponent has 0-7 digits). The bid says there are at least 2. If I challenge, and the total is 1 or 0, I win. But if opponent has another 2, then the bid is valid. Since I have one 2, if the opponent has at least one more, the bid holds. So the chance depends on opponent's hand. Since I don't know their hand, but the bid is 2 2s. Maybe the opponent might have a 2, but it's possible they don't. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 6s, that's a safer bid because I have two 6s. The bid would be valid because my two plus whatever the opponent has (if any). So even if opponent has zero, the total is 2, so the bid is exactly 2, which meets the requirement. Wait, but the bid must be strictly higher than the previous. The previous was 2 2s. So 2 6s is higher in digit, so it's acceptable. That seems safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe even better to bid higher. Like 3 of a digit. Let's see: 3 6s. I have two, so if opponent has one, it's okay. But if not, it's a bluff. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 2 9s. Since I have one 9, so if opponent has another, it's okay, but if not, then challenging would be better. \n\nHmm. The safest bid is 2 6s because I have two of them. That way, even if opponent has none, the bid is exactly 2, which is valid. Because the bid says \"at least 2 6s\", so if exactly 2, that's okay. So that bid is safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 3 6s, that's riskier because I only have two. \n\nSo between the options, bidding 2 6s is a valid higher bid and safe. \n\nAlternatively, could I bid a higher digit with same quantity, like 2 3s, 2 4s, etc. But since I have a 3 (one), 6 (two), 7 (one), 9 (one). The 6 is better because I have two. \n\nTherefore, the best move is to bid 2 6s. \n\nWait, but the current bid is 2 2s. The next bid can be either higher quantity (3 or more) or same quantity but higher digit. Since 6 is higher than 2, 2 6s is a valid bid. That's better than increasing quantity. \n\nYes, so the action should be BID: 2 6s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe even better to go higher. Let's see: 3 of any digit. Let's see if I can. For example, 3 6s. Since I have two, maybe opponent has one. But that's a risk. Alternatively, 3 of a lower digit but higher quantity. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent might have a 2. Since they bid 2 2s, maybe they have at least one. So challenging might not be good. \n\nTherefore, safest is to bid 2 6s. \n\nSo the reasoning would be something like: The current bid is 2 2s. I have two 6s in my hand. Bidding 2 6s is a valid higher bid (same quantity but higher digit). Since I have two, even if opponent has none, the bid holds. Therefore, the best move is to bid 2 6s."
