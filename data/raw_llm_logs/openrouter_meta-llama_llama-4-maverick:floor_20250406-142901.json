        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 4 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 3s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 32 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

To determine the likelihood of the bid being true, I need to consider the total count of 3s across all players. With 8 players having 8 digits each, there are 32 digits in total. My hand has one 3. The bid of 4 3s implies that there are at least four 3s in total. This is possible but I need to assess if it's likely. Since I have one 3, there are 24 digits left in other players' hands. If the remaining three 3s are distributed among the other players, it's plausible. However, I can bid higher to try and push the challenge further down the line or potentially get a more favorable outcome. I can bid 4 4s or 5 0s, for example. Bidding 4 4s seems reasonable as it increases the digit, and I have a 9 and other digits but no 4s, so it's a relatively safe increase. Bidding 5 0s would be a significant increase in quantity. Given my hand, I see two 0s and two 9s (which are not relevant to the bid directly), so bidding on 0s might not be a bad idea since I have some information about it. However, increasing the quantity significantly without a strong hand for the digit might not be wise. Thus, bidding 4 4s is a balanced move.\", \"action\": \"BID: 4 4s\"}",
