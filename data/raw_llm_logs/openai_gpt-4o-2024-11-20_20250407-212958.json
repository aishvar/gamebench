Looking at my hand (34890597), I have zero '2's. This means that Player 0 would need to have all three or more '2's in their hand for the bid to be valid. With 8 random digits in their hand, the probability of having three or more of a specific digit is relatively low. Therefore, it is unlikely that there are three or more '2's across both hands.
