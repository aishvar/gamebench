        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, I have my hand: 56297554. Let me count the digits I have. Breaking it down:\n\n- 5 appears three times (positions 1, 6, 7)\n- 6 appears once (position 2)\n- 2 appears once (position 3)\n- 9 appears once (position 4)\n- 7 appears once (position 5)\n- 4 appears once (position 8)\n\nSo, my hand has three 5s, and one each of 6, 2, 9, 7, and 4.\n\nSince it's my turn and the current bid is None, I need to make the first bid. The goal is to make a bid that's likely to be valid but also gives me a good chance of winning without being too obvious.\n\nI should consider the possible digits and their quantities. My hand has three 5s, which is a decent number. Since I'm starting, I can set the bid to something that's plausible but not too high.\n\nIf I bid 3 5s, that means I'm claiming there are at least three 5s in total across both hands. Since I have three, and the opponent has 8 digits, it's possible they have zero, one, or more 5s. But given that I'm starting, it's a reasonable bid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid higher, but as the first bid, it's better to start with a moderate number to see how the opponent reacts. Bidding 3 5s is a good starting point because it's based on my hand, and it's not too high that the opponent would easily challenge.\n\nI don't see any reason to challenge since there's no current bid. So, making a bid is the way to go.\n\nI think 3 5s is a solid opening because it's based on my actual hand, and it's a number that's likely to be achievable given the total of 16 digits. The opponent might have some 5s, but even if they don't, my bid is still valid because I have three.\n\nSo, I'll go with bidding 3 5s.\n"
