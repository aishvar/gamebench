Given that I only have one '5', it is plausible the opponent has a second '5', but not guaranteed. Since 2 fives is a conservative bid and not unlikely, challenging now would be premature. Instead, I will raise the bid. The simplest minimal raise is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, for example, bidding 2 6s. However, I have no '6's in my hand, making that risky. Alternatively, I have two '3's in my hand, so increasing the count on 3s is safer. The current bid is 2 5s, so the next valid higher bid would be 3 3s, increasing quantity. Since I have two '3's, it is plausible the opponent has at least one '3', making 3 3s a reasonable bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 3\"\n}",
