Given my hand (04245778), I can see that there are multiple occurrences of the digit '4' and '7'. To maximize my chances of making a valid bid, I'll choose a digit that appears at least once in my hand. The digit '4' appears twice, and '7' appears twice as well. I'll bid on the digit '4' with a quantity of 2, but since I don't know what the other player has, I'll start with the lowest possible bid for a digit I have, which is '2'. However, considering the rules, the bid should be in the format 'BID: X Y' where X is the quantity and Y is the digit. Therefore, my initial bid will be for the digit '4' with a quantity of 2, but to follow the exact format, I need to specify it as 'BID: 2 4'.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 4\"\n}\n```",
