You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move in this Liar's Poker game. Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that in Liar's Poker, each player has 8 secret digits, and the total number of digits between both players is 16. The current bid is 2 1s, made by Player 0. My job is to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have the digits 9, 8, 5, 2, 8, 6, 4, 6. Let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\n- 9: 1\n- 8: 2\n- 5: 1\n- 2: 1\n- 6: 2\n- 4: 1\n\nSo, I have two 8s and two 6s. The current bid is 2 1s, which means Player 0 is claiming that there are at least two 1s in total between both of us. \n\nNow, I need to think about what possible bids I can make. Since the current bid is 2 1s, I can either bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. For example, I could bid 3 of any digit, or 2 of a digit higher than 1, like 2 2s, 2 3s, etc.\n\nBut before making a bid, I should consider whether challenging is a better option. The bid is 2 1s. Do I think there are at least two 1s in total? Let's see. I don't have any 1s in my hand, so all the 1s would have to be in Player 0's hand. Since each player has 8 digits, Player 0 could potentially have two 1s, but it's also possible they have fewer.\n\nIf I challenge, and there are indeed two or more 1s, Player 0 wins. If there are fewer than two, I win. Since I don't have any 1s, I'm relying on whether Player 0 has at least two. But without knowing their hand, it's a bit of a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, I can make a bid based on the digits I have. I have two 8s and two 6s. So, I could bid 2 6s or 2 8s. But wait, the current bid is 2 1s. Bidding 2 6s would be a higher digit, so that's a valid bid. Similarly, 2 8s would be even higher. \n\nBidding 2 6s seems safer because I have two of them, and it's a higher digit than 1. This way, I'm not overextending, and I have a good chance of being correct. Plus, if Player 0 doesn't have many 6s, the total might still be two. \n\nI could also consider bidding a higher quantity, like 3 of a digit, but I only have two of 8 and 6. So, 3 might be risky unless I'm sure the opponent has at least one more of that digit. \n\nTherefore, the safest move is to bid 2 6s. It's a higher digit than the current bid, and I have the necessary count in my hand to support it. This way, I don't have to rely on the opponent's hand as much, and it's a solid move that's likely to be valid.\n"
