You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, the game is between two players, each with 8 secret digits. My hand is 83067346. The current bid is None, which means I'm the first to make a bid. Since there are no previous bids, I have to start the bidding. My goal is to make a bid that's as strong as possible but not so high that it's easily challengeable.\n\nLooking at my hand: 8, 3, 0, 6, 7, 3, 4, 6. Let me count the occurrences of each digit. \n\n- 0: 1\n- 3: 2\n- 4: 1\n- 6: 2\n- 7: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nSo, the digits I have are 0,3,4,6,7,8, each with their respective counts. Since the other player has 8 digits as well, the total possible count for any digit can't exceed 16 (since 8 each). \n\nI need to decide which digit to bid on. Higher digits are generally better because they give me more flexibility in future bids. But I also have to consider the quantity. Since I'm starting, I can choose any quantity from 1 to 16, but it's better to start with a lower quantity to keep the game going longer and gather more information.\n\nLooking at my counts, I have two 3s and two 6s. Bidding on 2 3s or 2 6s could be a good start. Between the two, 6 is a higher digit, so bidding on 6s might be better because it's a stronger digit, which could make it harder for the opponent to challenge. \n\nAlternatively, I could also consider the 0, but since it's the lowest digit, it's not ideal to start with that. Similarly, 4,7,8 are single digits, so bidding on them would be risky because the opponent might have none, making my bid potentially false.\n\nSo, I think bidding on 2 6s is a good move. It's a moderate quantity and a high digit, which should be safe because I have two of them. Even if the opponent has zero 6s, the total would be exactly 2, which meets my bid. If the opponent has one or two, it's still valid. \n\nI don't see any reason to challenge since there's no previous bid to challenge. So, I should make a bid. \n\nWait, another thought: maybe I should consider starting with a lower digit to keep options open. But since I have two 6s, which is a solid foundation, starting with 2 6s seems better. It's a strong opening that's hard to challenge because the minimum total would be 2, and the maximum could be up to 4 if the opponent has two as well. \n\nI think I'm confident enough with this bid. It's not too high, and I have the necessary count in my hand to support it. Plus, it's a higher digit, which is advantageous.\n"
