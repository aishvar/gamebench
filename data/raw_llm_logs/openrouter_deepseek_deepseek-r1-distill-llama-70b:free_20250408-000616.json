        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 1s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, let's break down this Liar's Poker situation. I'm Player 0, and it's my turn. The current bid is 3 1s from Player 1. My hand is 37316209. I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid.\n\nFirst, I'll look at my own hand. The digits I have are 3, 7, 3, 1, 6, 2, 0, 9. So, I have one 1, two 3s, and one each of 7, 6, 2, 0, and 9. The current bid is 3 1s. Since I only have one 1, that means Player 1 must have at least two 1s for the total to be three or more. But I don't know what they have, so I can't be certain.\n\nLooking at the bid history, I started with 2 3s, and Player 1 upped it to 3 1s. Now it's my turn. I need to either challenge their bid or make a higher bid. If I challenge, and the total number of 1s is less than 3, I win. If it's 3 or more, I lose. \n\nI have one 1, so if the total is exactly 3, Player 1 must have two 1s. If they have more, the total could be higher. But I don't have any information about their hand. Challenging is risky because there's a good chance they have enough 1s.\n\nAlternatively, I could make a higher bid. My options are to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the current bid is 3 1s, I can either bid 4 of a higher digit or keep the digit and increase the quantity. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 3s. Bidding 4 3s would require that there are at least four 3s in total. I have two, so Player 1 would need at least two more. That's possible, but again, uncertain. Alternatively, I could bid a higher digit with the same quantity, like 3 2s, but wait, 2 is lower than 1, so that wouldn't be higher. I need to go higher in digit or quantity.\n\nWait, digits go from 0 to 9, so higher digits are better. The current digit is 1, so I can go to 2 or higher. But if I bid 3 2s, that's a higher digit than 1, so that's a valid bid. However, I only have one 2, so Player 1 would need two more 2s for the total to be three. That might be possible, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 4 0s. I have one 0, so Player 1 would need three more. That seems less likely, but I don't know. Or 4 2s, but I only have one 2.\n\nAnother option is to bid 3 3s. Since I have two 3s, Player 1 would need one more. That's more plausible. So, 3 3s is a higher bid than 3 1s because 3 is higher than 1. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think bidding 3 3s is a reasonable move. It's a higher digit, and I have two of them, so there's a good chance the total could be at least three. Alternatively, if I'm unsure, I could challenge, but I think bidding is safer in this case.\n"
