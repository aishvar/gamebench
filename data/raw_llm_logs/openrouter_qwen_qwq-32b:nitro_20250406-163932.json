You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to decide whether to bid or challenge here. The current bid is 3 6s from Player 0. My turn is Player 1, so I have to respond.\n\nFirst, check my hand: 40723914. Let me count the digits here. The digits are 4, 0, 7, 2, 3, 9, 1, 4. So looking for 6s in my hand\u2014there are none. The current bid is 3 6s, meaning the total across both hands must have at least three 6s. Since I have zero, maybe Player 0 has some. But how many could they have?\n\nThe previous bids: Player 0 started with 2 6s, then Player 1 (me) bid 2 7s, then Player 0 raised to 3 6s. Since my previous bid was 2 7s, which is a different digit, the current bid is now 3 6s. \n\nI need to decide if I can safely challenge or if I should bid higher. If I challenge, we'll check the total 6s. If there are less than 3, I win. But if there are 3 or more, I lose. Since I have zero 6s, the opponent must have at least three 6s, or maybe two and I have none. Wait, but the total is both players' hands. Since I have none, their hand must have at least three 6s to make the total 3. That seems unlikely. \n\nWait, the maximum possible 6s in their hand is 8 digits, but to reach 3 total, they need at least 3. But is that possible? Maybe, but maybe not. Let's think: if they have three 6s, then the bid is valid. But how likely is that? Since they made the bid, they might have some. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid higher. The current bid is 3 6s. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity to 4, or same quantity but higher digit. For example, 3 7s would be a valid higher bid. Let me see my hand again. Do I have any 7s? My hand has a 7 (the third digit). So I have one 7. \n\nWait, the bid of 3 7s would require that there are at least three 7s in total. Since I have one, the opponent would need at least two. But I don't know their hand. Alternatively, maybe I can bid 3 7s, but that's risky. Alternatively, maybe 4 of a lower digit? Like 4 5s, but I don't have any 5s. Let's check my hand again: 4,0,7,2,3,9,1,4. No 5s. \n\nAlternatively, 3 7s. Since I have one 7, maybe I can bid 3 7s. But if the opponent has none, the total would be 1, which is less than 3. So that would be a lie, but maybe I can bluff. Alternatively, maybe challenging is better here. \n\nWait, the bid is 3 6s. The current total of 6s is the opponent's 6s plus mine (which are zero). So if I challenge, the total is just their 6s. If they have three or more, I lose. If they have two or fewer, I win. \n\nPlayer 0 made the bid of 3 6s. They might have at least two 6s in their hand to make the total 3. But if they only have two, then adding mine (0) would be 2, so the bid would be wrong. But why would they bid 3 unless they have at least one? Maybe they have three themselves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have two and are bluffing. Since I can't see their hand, it's risky. The probability here: assuming their hand is random, the chance that their 8 digits have at least three 6s is low. The average number of 6s in 8 digits is 0.8 (since each digit has 1/10 chance). So having three is possible but not very likely. \n\nTherefore, challenging might be a good move here. The bid of 3 6s would require that their hand has three or more 6s. Since my hand has none, the total is exactly their count. So if I challenge, there's a decent chance their count is less than 3. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid instead, maybe I can go to 3 7s. Since I have one 7, but that's still a big call. Or maybe 4 of a lower digit. But maybe challenging is better here. \n\nThe possible options: challenging the 3 6s. The risk is if they have three 6s, I lose. But given that they had to raise from 2 to 3, maybe they have at least two 6s. But maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is overreaching. Let me think of the bidding history. The initial bid was 2 6s, then I bid 2 7s (which is higher in digit), so then they raised to 3 6s. They might have two 6s in their hand, so with their two plus my zero, they bid 3, assuming I have one? Wait, but my bid was 2 7s, which doesn't involve 6s. Hmm, maybe they think I have none, so they have three? Not sure. \n\nConsidering that the current bid is 3 6s, and I have zero, challenging could be the best option here. The chance that the total is 3 or more is low. So I think challenging is better here.\n"
