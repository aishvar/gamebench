You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to make the first bid in this Liar's Poker game. My hand is 97430412. Let me count how many of each digit I have.\n\nLooking at my digits:\n9, 7, 4, 3, 0, 4, 1, 2.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n0: 1\n1: 1\n2: 1\n3: 1\n4: 2\n7: 1\n9: 1\n\nNo digits 5, 6, or 8 in my hand. \n\nSince there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total digits in play are 16. The current bid is None, so I can start with any valid bid. My goal is to make a bid that's not too risky but also not easy for the opponent to challenge. \n\nI have two 4s. If I bid on 4s, I can start with a quantity of 2. But maybe I can go a bit higher. Let's think: the opponent has 8 digits. If I bid 3 4s, that means the opponent needs to have at least one more 4. But I don't know their hand. Alternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, 3 9s. But I only have one 9. So if I bid 2 9s, the opponent needs to have at least one 9. But that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a lower digit with a higher quantity. For example, 3 0s. I have one 0. The opponent might have another one. But 3 total 0s is possible. \n\nHmm. The safest initial bid would be based on the digits I have the most of. I have two 4s. So starting with 2 4s is safe. But since I can start with any bid, maybe I can go a bit higher. If I bid 3 4s, that's possible. But if the opponent has only one 4, that would make total 3, which matches. But if they have none, then it's 2. So maybe 3 4s is a bit risky. Alternatively, bid a higher digit. For example, 2 9s. Since I have one 9, the opponent only needs to have one. But that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher quantity but a lower digit. Like 3 0s. Since 0 is a lower digit, but quantity 3. But I have one 0. If the opponent has two, then total is 3. If they have one, then 2. So that's a bit of a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a middle digit. Like 3 5s. But I have no 5s. So that's risky. Maybe not. \n\nWait, the opponent has 8 digits. The total possible for any digit is 16. But since we each have 8, the maximum possible for a digit is 8 (if both players have all 8 of that digit). But that's extremely unlikely. \n\nSo considering my hand, the digits I have the most of are 4s (two). So starting with 2 4s is safe. But since the first bid can be anything, maybe I can go a bit higher. Let's think: if I bid 3 4s, then the opponent can challenge if they have less than 1 4. But if they have one, total is 3. So 3 4s would be a valid bid. But I have two, so opponent needs at least one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 7s. I have one 7. Opponent might have another. But that's a higher digit than 4. So 2 7s is higher than 2 4s. Wait, but the current bid is none. So I can start with any bid. The first bid can be any quantity and digit. So maybe start with a lower quantity but higher digit. For example, 1 9. But that's not useful. \n\nWait, the rules say that the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid. But the current bid is None, so any bid is allowed. So the first move can be any bid. So maybe the best strategy is to start with a bid that's based on the highest count in my hand. Since I have two 4s, bidding 2 4s is safe. But perhaps I can start with a higher bid to make the opponent challenge. Alternatively, maybe start with a more common digit. For example, 0 might be more common in the total pool. But I have one 0. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the total digits are 16, maybe starting with a low quantity but higher digit. For example, 2 7s. But I have one, so opponent needs one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 3 4s. Since I have two, opponent needs at least one. That's possible. \n\nBut since it's the first bid, maybe the opponent will challenge if they think it's unlikely. If I bid 3 4s, and they have none, then the total is 2, so they can challenge and win. But if they have at least one, then the total is 3, and I win. So maybe 3 4s is a bit risky. \n\nAlternatively, start with 2 4s. That's safe because I have two, and the opponent could have none or more. But then the next player can bid higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit but same quantity. For example, 2 5s. But I have none. So that's risky. \n\nWait, maybe the best approach is to start with a bid that's based on the number of that digit in my hand plus at least one from the opponent. For example, I have two 4s. If I bid 3 4s, that's assuming opponent has at least one. If they do, then the bid is valid. If not, they can challenge. But whether that's a good move depends on the opponent's hand. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity but higher digit to force the opponent into a position where they have to bid higher. For example, bid 1 9s. I have one, so if the opponent has none, they might challenge. If they have one, then the total is 2. But since I'm the first bidder, maybe that's not the best approach. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the total possible digits are 16, starting with a bid that's a mid-range quantity but a common digit. For example, 4 0s. But I have one 0. So opponent would need three, which is possible but unlikely. \n\nHmm. Maybe the safest first bid is to start with the digit I have the most of, which is 4s. So bid 2 4s. That's truthful in my hand, and the opponent might have more. Alternatively, bid 3 4s to be a bit more aggressive. \n\nBut since it's the first move, I need to balance between being aggressive and cautious. If I bid too high, the opponent might challenge. If I bid too low, the opponent can easily raise. \n\nConsidering that the opponent has 8 digits, the probability that they have at least one 4 is higher than not. So bidding 3 4s might be reasonable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 4s. That's safe, but then the opponent can bid 2 5s or higher. \n\nWait, the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid. Since the current bid is None, any bid is allowed. So the first bid can be anything. But when the next player bids, they have to bid higher than my bid. \n\nSo if I start with 2 4s, the opponent can bid 3 of any digit, or 2 of a higher digit. For example, 2 5s. \n\nAlternatively, if I start with 3 4s, the opponent can bid 4 of any digit, or 3 of a higher digit. \n\nSo perhaps starting with a higher quantity but lower digit might be better. For example, 4 0s. But I have one 0. So opponent would need three. That's possible but maybe less likely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 3 4s. Since I have two, opponent needs one. Let's say there's a 50% chance they have at least one. If they challenge and have none, I lose. If they have one, I win. \n\nBut as the first bid, maybe a safer approach is better. Let me check my hand again. My counts:\n\n0:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:2, 7:1, 9:1. \n\nSo the highest count is 4s (2). Next, 0,1,2,3,7,9 each have 1. \n\nSo maybe start with 2 4s. That's a truthful bid based on my hand, and the opponent might have more. If the opponent has 1, total is 3. So they can bid higher. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 4s, the next player could bid 2 5s, which is higher in digit. But since I have no 5s, they might have some. \n\nAlternatively, they might challenge if they have no 4s and think the total is 2. But with two 4s in my hand, the total is at least 2. So if I bid 2 4s, the actual count is at least 2, so if they challenge, I win. Wait, no. If I bid 2 4s, and they challenge, the total count must be >=2. Since I have 2, even if they have 0, the total is 2. So 2 4s is a guaranteed valid bid. Because the total is exactly 2. So if I bid 2 4s, the opponent can't challenge successfully because the count is exactly 2. Therefore, they have to bid higher. \n\nWait, that's a good point. Because the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So if I bid 2 4s, and the total is 2, which is equal to the bid quantity, then it's valid. So challenging would make the challenger lose. Therefore, bidding 2 4s is a safe move because even if the opponent challenges, I win. \n\nBut wait, my hand has two 4s, so the total is at least two. The opponent's hand could have more. But regardless, the total is at least two. So the bid of 2 4s is truthful. Therefore, the opponent cannot challenge it successfully. \n\nTherefore, the safest first bid is 2 4s. That way, I'm guaranteed to have a valid bid, and the opponent has to either bid higher or challenge and lose. \n\nSo the action should be BID: 2 4s.\n"
