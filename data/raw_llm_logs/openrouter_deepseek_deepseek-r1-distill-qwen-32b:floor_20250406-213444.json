You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let's see, I have the hand 02660975, which are eight digits. The current bid is 3 7s made by Player 1. The previous bid was 3 6s from me. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules. Each player has eight digits, so combined there are 16 digits in total. When someone bids, they're stating that there are at least a certain number of a specific digit across both hands. The bid can be increased either by a higher quantity or, if the quantity is the same, by a higher digit.\n\nLooking at my hand: 0,2,6,6,0,9,7,5. So, I have two 6s in my hand. The last bid was 3 7s. I need to decide whether to challenge that or make a higher bid.\n\nIf I challenge, we'll reveal the actual count of 7s. If there are at least three 7s, Player 1 wins; otherwise, I win. But I only have one 7 in my hand. So, the total number of 7s could be one or two, depending on Player 1's hand. Since the maximum total is 16, three 7s would mean Player 1 has two 7s. But that seems possible, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I could make a higher bid. To do that, I need to bid either a higher quantity or a higher digit with the same quantity. The current bid is 3 7s. To go higher, I could bid 4 of any digit or 3 of a digit higher than 7, which would be 8 or 9.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have a 9 and a 7. If I bid 3 9s, that would be a higher bid because 9 is higher than 7, and the quantity is the same. But do I have enough information to make that bid? I have one 9, so I'm assuming Player 1 might have some 9s as well. But it's risky because if the total is less than 3, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 4 of a digit. Since I have two 6s, maybe I could bid 4 6s. But wait, the previous bid was 3 6s from me, and then Player 1 went to 3 7s. If I bid 4 6s, that's a higher quantity than 3, so it's a valid bid. But I only have two 6s. So, I'm assuming Player 1 has two 6s as well, making it four in total. That could be possible, but it's a bit of a stretch.\n\nAnother option is to bid 3 8s. Since 8 is higher than 7, that would be a valid bid. But I don't have any 8s in my hand, so I'm not sure if that's a good move. It might be too risky because if Player 1 doesn't have any 8s, the total could be low.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the likelihood. The current bid is 3 7s. I have one 7, so the maximum possible is three if Player 1 has two. But maybe they don't. If I challenge, and the total is less than three, I win. But if it's three or more, I lose. It's a gamble, but considering the previous bid was 3 6s, which I had two of, maybe Player 1 is trying to bluff.\n\nAlternatively, if I make a bid, I have to make sure it's valid. Bidding 3 9s would require that there are at least three 9s. I have one, so Player 1 would need at least two. If they don't, then challenging would reveal that. But I don't know their hand.\n\nHmm, maybe challenging is the safer option here. Since I have one 7, the total can't be more than two unless Player 1 has two. But if I challenge, and the total is two, then Player 1's bid of three is false, and I win. If it's three, I lose. But given that Player 1 just increased the bid from 3 6s to 3 7s, maybe they're trying to bluff, thinking I have more 6s. But I only have two, so maybe they're overestimating.\n\nAlternatively, if I bid 3 9s, it's a higher bid, but I'm not sure if it's safe. Maybe I should go with challenging because the current bid seems high given that I only have one 7.\n"
