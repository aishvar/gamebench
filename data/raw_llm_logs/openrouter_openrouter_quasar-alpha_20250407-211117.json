For the bid to be valid, there must be at least two sixes between both hands. Since I only have one, the opponent would need at least one six in their hand. This is plausible, so challenging now is risky. To maintain strategic pressure, I can safely increase the bid by either quantity or digit. The next minimal valid bid is 2 7s (same quantity, higher digit), which is reasonable because I have one 7 in my hand, making it possible there are two total. This is a safe incremental bid that keeps options open.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 7\"\n}",
