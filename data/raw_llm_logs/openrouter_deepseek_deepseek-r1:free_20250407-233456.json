You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I'm Player 0, and my hand is 6,7,4,1,8,9,1,3. The current bid is None, so I need to make the first bid. Since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total digits in play are 16. My hand has two 1s, and one each of 3,4,6,7,8,9. \n\nI should start by considering the digits I have. The most frequent in my hand is 1 with two copies. But since the opponent has 8 digits, there could be more of that digit. If I bid on 1s, maybe starting with a quantity of 3? Because I have two, so the opponent might have at least one more. But maybe that's a bit risky. Alternatively, I could pick a higher digit where I have one, like 9, and bid 1 9s. But that's a low quantity.\n\nWait, the first bid can be any quantity and digit. The key is to start with a bid that's plausible but not too high. Since the next player has to either bid higher or challenge. If I start too high, they might challenge. But if I start too low, they can easily raise. \n\nLooking at my hand, the digits I have are 1 (two), 3,4,6,7,8,9. Let's count the possible maximums. For example, if I bid on 1s, I have two, so the opponent could have up to 6 more (since they have 8 digits). But that's unlikely. Maybe a safer bid is to go for a digit that's less common. For instance, 8s. I have one 8. The opponent could have 0 or more. If I bid 2 8s, that's possible. But if they have none, then the total is 1, which would make my bid invalid. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 2 1s. Since I have two, and the opponent might have one or two. So total could be 3 or 4. So bidding 3 1s would be a possible start. But is that too aggressive?\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity but higher digit. For example, 2 6s. I have one 6. The opponent could have one, making total 2. So 2 6s would be safe. But if they have none, then the total is 1, which would be a loss if challenged. But since it's the first bid, maybe the opponent will just bid higher instead of challenging. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the total possible for any digit is 16 (if all 16 digits are the same, which is impossible here since each player has 8 unique digits? Wait, no, the rules don't say the digits are unique. Wait, the problem says \"each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\" Are the digits in a player's hand allowed to have duplicates? Because in the example given, the user's hand is 67418913, which has two 1s. So yes, duplicates are allowed. So each player has 8 digits, which can include duplicates. So the total possible for a digit is up to 16 (if all 16 digits across both players are the same). \n\nSo, in my hand, I have two 1s. The opponent could have up to 6 more 1s (if their entire hand is 1s). But that's unlikely. So if I bid 3 1s, that's possible. But if the opponent has, say, one 1, then total is 3, which meets the bid. If they have none, then total is 2, which would be a loss if challenged. But since it's the first bid, the opponent might not challenge immediately. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, 2 9s. I have one 9. The opponent could have one, making total 2. So that's safe. But if they have none, then total is 1, which would be a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a middle digit like 4. I have one 4. If I bid 2 4s, the opponent could have one. But again, risky. \n\nAlternatively, since the first bid can be anything, maybe start with a low quantity but a high digit. For example, 1 9s. But that's a very low bid, and the opponent can easily raise. \n\nWait, the rules say that the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid. Since the current bid is None, the first bid can be any quantity and digit. So the first player can start with any bid. But the next player has to bid higher. So maybe starting with a moderate bid that's not too high but gives room to maneuver. \n\nLooking at my hand, the digits I have are: 1 (2), 3,4,6,7,8,9. So the highest digit I have is 9. If I bid 1 9s, that's possible, but the opponent can just bid 2 of a higher digit, like 2 0s (since 0 is higher than 9? Wait, digits are 0-9. Wait, in the rules, when comparing bids, same quantity but higher digit. So 3 5s can be beaten by 3 6s. So digits are ordered 0-9, with 9 being the highest. So 0 is the lowest digit. So if I bid 1 9s, the next player can bid 1 0s, but that's lower. Wait, no. Wait, the bid must be strictly higher. So higher quantity, or same quantity and higher digit. So if the current bid is 1 9s, the next bid must be either 2 of any digit, or 1 of a higher digit than 9. But since 9 is the highest digit, you can't have a higher digit. So the only way to beat 1 9s is to bid 2 of any digit. \n\nSo if I start with 1 9s, the opponent has to bid at least 2 of any digit. That might be a good strategy because they can't go higher in digit. So they have to increase the quantity. But if they have a lot of a lower digit, they can bid higher. \n\nAlternatively, starting with a higher quantity. For example, 3 1s. Since I have two, maybe the opponent has one. But if they have none, then total is 2, which would be a problem if they challenge. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 2 1s. Since I have two, the opponent could have zero or more. If I bid 2 1s, the opponent can challenge, but if they have at least zero, the total is at least 2 (since I have two). Wait, no. If I have two, and the opponent has zero, the total is two. So if I bid 2 1s, and the opponent challenges, the total is two, which meets the bid. So I would win. Wait, the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So if the bid is 2 1s, and the total is exactly 2, then the bid is valid. So if I bid 2 1s, and the opponent challenges, they lose because the total is 2. So that's safe. \n\nWait, but in that case, bidding 2 1s is safe because even if the opponent has none, the total is 2. So the bid is valid. So that's a safe opening. Then the opponent has to either bid higher (like 3 of any digit, or 2 of a higher digit). But since 1 is a low digit, they can bid 2 2s, which is higher. \n\nBut if I bid 2 1s, and the opponent has, say, one 1, then the total is 3. But my bid is 2, which is still valid. So regardless of the opponent's hand, as long as I have two 1s, the total is at least two. So bidding 2 1s is a safe opening because even if challenged, I win. \n\nThat seems like a solid move. Because the opponent can't challenge successfully. So the action would be to bid 2 1s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid higher. But why? Because if I bid 2 1s, the opponent can bid 2 2s, which is higher. Then I have to respond. But if I bid 3 1s, then the opponent might challenge if they have none. But since I have two, the total would be two, which is less than 3, so I lose. So that's risky. \n\nSo the safest opening is to bid the exact number of a digit I have, so that even if the opponent has none, the total is at least that. So for example, I have two 1s. Bidding 2 1s is safe. Because the total is at least two. So if the opponent challenges, I win. If they don't, they have to bid higher. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the best opening bid here is 2 1s. That's a safe bid because the total can't be less than 2. So the action should be BID: 2 1s.\n"
