        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 1s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

I notice I have two 0s in my hand. \n\nThe current bid is 3 1s, made by Player 1. The bidding history shows that the bids have been escalating, with each player increasing either the quantity or the digit. \n\nI need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid. \n\nConsidering the current bid of 3 1s, I have one 1 in my hand. Since there are 8 digits per player, the total across both players is 16. If I assume Player 1 has some 1s, but given my own hand, it's possible that the total number of 1s isn't extremely high. \n\nI have two 0s, and since the last bid was 3 1s, I can try to bid on a digit that's higher than 1 but with a quantity that's feasible. \n\nLooking at my hand again, I have a 6. Maybe I can bid on 6s. Since I have one 6, and considering the maximum possible is 16, bidding 4 6s seems plausible. It's higher in quantity than the current bid of 3, and the digit is higher than 1. \n\nAlternatively, I could challenge, but given that 3 1s isn't an extremely high bid, and I have some information about my own hand, making a bid might be safer. \n\nSo, I'll go with bidding 4 6s.\n"
