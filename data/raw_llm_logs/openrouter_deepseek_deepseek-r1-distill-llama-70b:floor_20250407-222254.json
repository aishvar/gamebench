You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, the game is between two players, each with 8 secret digits. My hand is 52439800. I need to make a bid based on this. The current bid is None, which means I'm the first to bid. \n\nSince there are no previous bids, I have to start from scratch. My goal is to make a bid that's reasonable but also gives me an advantage. I should look at my own hand to see which digits I have and how many of each. \n\nLooking at my hand: 5, 2, 4, 3, 9, 8, 0, 0. So, I have two 0s, and one each of 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9. The digits I have are spread out, but I have the most of 0s. \n\nSince the bid has to be a quantity and a digit, I need to choose a digit I have and decide how many to bid. But I don't know what the other player has. The maximum possible for any digit is 16, since both players have 8 digits each.\n\nI have two 0s. If I bid on 0s, I can say at least 2, but maybe I can bid higher. But if I bid too high, the other player might challenge me, and if the total isn't enough, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, I could choose another digit I have, like 5, 2, etc., but since I only have one of each, bidding on them might not be as safe. \n\nWait, but if I bid 2 0s, it's a safe bet because I have two, and the other player might have none or some. But maybe I can bid higher. If I bid 3 0s, and the other player has at least one, then the total would be 3 or more. But if they have zero, then the total is 2, which is less than my bid, and I lose. \n\nHmm, so maybe starting with a lower bid is safer. Since I'm the first to bid, I can set a foundation. Bidding 2 0s seems safe because I have two, and unless the other player has zero 0s, the bid will hold. But if they have one, the total is 3, which is still more than my bid. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid on another digit, but I don't have multiple of any other digit. So 0s seem like the best choice. \n\nI think I'll go with 2 0s. It's a modest bid, and it's based on what I have. Plus, it's the first bid, so it's a starting point. If the other player challenges, and if they have at least one 0, I win. If they have none, I lose, but I think it's a reasonable risk because having two 0s is a good starting point.\n\nWait, but maybe I can bid higher. If I bid 3 0s, and the other player has at least one, then I'm safe. But if they have none, I lose. Since I don't know their hand, it's a bit risky. But considering that 0 is a common digit, maybe they have at least one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should bid 4 0s. That would mean I'm claiming there are at least four 0s in total. But I only have two, so the other player would need to have two as well. That might be pushing it. \n\nI think 2 0s is the safest. It's a low bid, easy to meet, and sets the stage for the game. Plus, it's based on my actual count, so it's honest, which is good because if someone challenges, I have a higher chance of winning.\n\nSo, I'll make the bid of 2 0s.\n"
