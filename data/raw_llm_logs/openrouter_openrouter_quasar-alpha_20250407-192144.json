Since I hold the entire count of the current bid, the minimum total is exactly 2. It is very plausible that the opponent has zero sixes, but since the bid equals my known count, I cannot confidently challenge it as unlikely. To maintain pressure and continue the game, I can safely increase the bid quantity to 3 sixes, but that would be risky without more information. Alternatively, I can increase the bid digit while keeping the quantity at 2. I have two 5s in my hand, so a bid of 2 7s or 2 8s would be less safe. The best strategic move is to increase the quantity to 3 sixes, as it's a natural escalation and forces the opponent to either challenge or raise further.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 6\"\n}",
