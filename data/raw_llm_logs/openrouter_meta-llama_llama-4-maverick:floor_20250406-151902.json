        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

My hand is 37036911, which contains two 6s and no 7s or higher relevant digits that could directly influence the count of 6s or higher digits. The bid history shows an escalation between 6s and 7s. Since I have two 6s, and the total count of 6s must be at least 2 (from my hand) plus at least 2 (from the opponent's hand, because they bid 4 6s), it seems plausible they have at least two 6s. However, I can bid higher than 4 6s by either increasing the quantity or changing the digit to a higher one. I can bid 4 7s or higher quantity with 6s. Since I don't have any 7s, bidding 4 7s might be risky unless my opponent has a lot of 7s. Bidding 5 6s is a safer option as it directly builds upon the current bid without changing the digit, and it's still within a reasonable range given the total count of digits is 16. Thus, I will increase the quantity.\", \"action\": \"BID: 5 6s\"}",
