You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 13643093. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules. Each player has 8 digits, so there are 16 digits in total. The goal is to bid on the total count of a specific digit across both players. The bid has to be a quantity and a digit, like \"3 5s\". The next bid has to be higher, either in quantity or digit. I can also challenge the last bid if I think it's too high.\n\nSince the current bid is None, I get to start. I need to decide what to bid. Let me look at my hand: 1, 3, 6, 4, 3, 0, 9, 3. So, I have three 3s, and one each of 0,1,4,6,9. \n\nI should think about which digit to choose. The digits I have multiple of are 3s. Since I have three, maybe I can bid on 3s. But wait, the other player could also have some 3s. I don't know their hand, so I need to be cautious.\n\nIf I bid 3 3s, that's a safe start because I know I have three. But maybe I can go higher. But if I go to 4 3s, and the other player has at least one 3, that would make it valid. But if they have none, then I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, I could choose a digit I have only one of, but that might be riskier because I don't know the opponent's hand. Let's see, 0s: I have one, but maybe the opponent has none or some. Same with 1,4,6,9.\n\nSince I have three 3s, I think starting with 3 3s is a good opening. It's a moderate bid, not too high, not too low. It gives me a chance to see how the opponent reacts. Plus, it's based on my actual count, so it's likely to be a strong starting point.\n\nI don't think I should challenge because there's no bid to challenge yet. So my action is to bid 3 3s.\n"
