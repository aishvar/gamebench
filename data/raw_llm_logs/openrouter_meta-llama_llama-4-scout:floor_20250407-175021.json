I don't have enough '8's to make a higher bid than 3, but I do have a '7' that could potentially be used to make a valid bid. However, bidding '3 7s' or lower would not exceed the current bid of '3 8s' in terms of quantity or digit. I can try to bid '4 7s' because even if the other player has no '7's, my hand alone could have up to 2 '7's but only 1 '7' is visible. The bid needs to be higher either in quantity or digit. Since I have 1 '7' and 1 '8', and assuming the other player might have some '8's but likely not more than 2 given the current bid, I could challenge or bid higher with a different digit. Given my hand, bidding '4 7s' seems reasonable as it exceeds the quantity of '8s' bid so far and leverages my available digits effectively.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: Q D\"\n}\n```",
