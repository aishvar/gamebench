        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nSo, each player has 8 secret digits, making a total of 16 digits across both hands. My hand is 15502997, which I can see. The other player's hand is hidden. The current bid is None, which means I'm the first to bid. \n\nSince I'm the first player, I need to make an opening bid. The bid has to be a quantity and a digit. The quantity can't be more than 16 because that's the total number of digits. But I should base my bid on my own hand and try to estimate what the other player might have.\n\nLooking at my hand: 1,5,5,0,2,9,9,7. Let me count the digits I have:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 1\n- 5: 2\n- 7: 1\n- 9: 2\n\nSo, the digits I have are mostly low numbers, with two 5s and two 9s. The 5s and 9s might be good candidates for a bid because they're higher digits, which could make my bid more convincing.\n\nSince I'm starting, I need to choose a quantity and a digit. The quantity has to be at least 1, but I need to make it high enough to potentially force the other player into a tough spot, but not so high that it's obviously false.\n\nIf I bid on 5s, I have two. Maybe I can say there are three 5s total. That way, if the other player doesn't have any 5s, they might be tempted to challenge, but if they do, they might have to go higher. Alternatively, I could bid on 9s, since I have two, but 9 is a higher digit, so maybe a bid on 5s would be safer.\n\nWait, but since I'm the first to bid, I have to make the initial claim. Maybe starting with a moderate bid on a common digit would be better. Let's see, 5s are somewhat common, but not too common. If I bid 3 5s, that's plausible because I have two, so maybe the other player has one. If they don't, they might challenge, but if they do, they might have to go higher.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 9s. I have two, so maybe bid 3 9s. But 9 is a higher digit, so if I bid 3 9s, the other player might think it's too high and challenge, especially if they don't have any 9s. \n\nHmm, maybe starting with a bid on 5s is better because it's a mid-range digit and might be more likely to have a few in the other player's hand. So, I'll go with 3 5s. That way, if the other player has one or two, they might have to increase the quantity or the digit. If they don't have any, they might challenge, but I'm taking a calculated risk here.\n\nI think 3 5s is a reasonable opening bid. It's not too high, but it's enough to potentially control the game flow.\n"
