The current bid is \\'2 9s\\', meaning my opponent claims there are at least 2 nines total between our hands. Since I have 1 nine, this means my opponent would need to have at least 1 nine in their hand for this bid to be true. This is entirely possible, so challenging now would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity of 9s (to 3 9s), or I can bid a higher digit (which would be impossible since 9 is already the highest digit), or I can bid a lower digit but with a higher quantity. Since I have one 5 and one 7 in my hand, bidding on those would be risky. I notice I have two digits that appear twice in my hand: 5 appears once, and I could bid \\'3 5s\\', but that\\'s risky if my opponent has no 5s. Looking at my hand, I see I have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 5, one 7, one 8, one 9, and one 5. A safer bid would be \\'3 0s\\', \\'3 1s\\', or \\'3 2s\\', as I only need my opponent to have 2 of these digits for my bid to be valid. I\\'ll go with \\'3 1s\\' as a strategic move.\",\\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 1\"\\n}', type='text')"
