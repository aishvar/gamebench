        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 2s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

Since my hand is 89170367, I have a total of 2 twos, which could potentially make the bid 5 2s if I include the possibility of Player 0 having more twos. However, I don't want to overestimate. I see that I have one 3 and several higher digits. A reasonable bid would be to increase the quantity or the digit. Given that I have one 3 and several higher digits, I can try to bid higher with a digit I have. I have one 2, so I can safely assume there are at least 3 2s if Player 0 only has 2 twos. However, I will increase the digit and keep the quantity the same or increase it slightly. I have two 6s and two 7s and one 8 and one 9, but no more 2s or 3s or 4s or 5s. My best bet seems to increase the digit. I have 2 sixes, 1 seven, 1 eight, 1 nine, and 1 six and 1 seven and 1 nine and 1 eight and 1 six. I should try to make a higher bid with a digit I have. I will bid 4 3s because I do not have 3s but I do have higher digits.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 3s\"\n}",
