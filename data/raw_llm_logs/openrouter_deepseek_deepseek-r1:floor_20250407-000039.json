You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to make the first bid in this game of Liar's Poker. My hand is 40477213. Let me count how many of each digit I have.\n\nLooking at my hand: 4, 0, 4, 7, 7, 2, 1, 3. So breaking it down:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 1\n- 3: 1\n- 4: 2\n- 7: 2\n\nSo the digits 4 and 7 each have two in my hand. The rest are single occurrences. Since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total digits in play are 16. The opponent could have any combination.\n\nSince the current bid is None, I can start with any valid bid. The strategy here is to start with a bid that's plausible based on my own hand but not too high, to avoid being challenged immediately. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 4s and two 7s. Maybe starting with a bid on 4s or 7s. Let's think about the possible total. If I bid two 4s, that's already what I have. But the opponent could have more. However, if I bid, say, three 4s, that means the opponent needs to have at least one more 4. Since there are 16 digits total, and 4 is one of the digits, it's possible but not certain. But as the first bid, maybe starting with a lower quantity but a higher digit? Wait, the first bid has to be any valid, but the next bids have to be higher. So the first bid can be anything, but I want to set a baseline that's not too easy to challenge.\n\nAlternatively, since I have two 4s, maybe bid three 4s. That way, the opponent would need at least one 4 in their hand for the bid to be valid. If they have none, they might challenge, but if they have one or more, then the bid stands. Alternatively, maybe start with a higher digit to force the next player to have to bid a higher quantity or digit. For example, if I bid two 7s, since I have two, the opponent might have some 7s as well.\n\nWait, the bid needs to be a quantity and a digit, and the next bid must be higher. Higher is either a higher quantity (same digit), same quantity but higher digit, or higher quantity and higher digit.\n\nSo if I start with, say, two 4s, the next player can bid two 5s, two 6s, etc., or three of any digit. But if I start with a higher digit, like two 7s, then the next player can't bid two 8s or 9s, which are higher digits with the same quantity, so they'd have to go to three of any digit. That might be a better strategy because it limits their options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a low digit but higher quantity. For example, three 2s. But I only have one 2. But the opponent could have two or more. But that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the total possible is 16 digits, but any individual digit can have up to 16. But realistically, with each player having 8 digits, the maximum possible for any digit is 8 (if both players have all 8 as that digit). But that's very unlikely.\n\nSo, to start, perhaps bid on a digit I have multiple of. Let's say I bid two 4s. That's safe for me because I have two. The opponent might have 0-6 4s. But if they have at least one, the total is three, which would make my bid of two 4s correct. Wait, no, the bid is the quantity. If I bid two 4s, and the total is two or more, then the bid is valid. So if I have two, and the opponent has zero, the total is two, which meets the bid. So even if I bid two 4s, and the opponent has zero, the total is two, which is equal to the bid, so the bid is valid. Wait, no: the rule says \"at least three 5s\" in the example. Wait, the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. Wait, looking back: \"a bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\"\n\nSo if I bid two 4s, the total must be at least two 4s. Since I already have two, even if the opponent has zero, the total is two, which meets the bid. Therefore, bidding two 4s is safe because if the opponent challenges, they lose, because the total is exactly two. Therefore, starting with a bid of two 4s is a safe opening.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid higher, but maybe that's unnecessary. However, since I can start with any bid, maybe starting with a higher quantity on a lower digit. For example, three 2s. But I only have one 2. If I bid three 2s, the opponent needs to have at least two 2s. That's possible but risky. If they have one, total is two, which is less than three, so a challenge would lose for me.\n\nSo maybe better to start with a bid that's based on what I have. Since I have two 4s and two 7s, maybe bid two 7s. Since 7 is a higher digit than 4, but the quantity is the same. But since the opponent could have more 7s, but it's safer to bid on a higher digit if possible.\n\nAlternatively, bid two 4s. Let's think: If I bid two 4s, the total is at least two. Since I have two, the opponent could have zero, making the total two, which is exactly the bid. So the bid is valid. Therefore, if I bid two 4s, and the opponent challenges, they lose. So that's a safe bid.\n\nBut maybe I can start with a higher quantity. For example, three 4s. Then the total needs to be at least three. I have two, so the opponent needs at least one. If they have one or more, the bid is valid. If they have none, then the total is two, which is less than three, so if they challenge, I lose. So that's riskier.\n\nAlternatively, bid two 7s. Since I have two, and the opponent might have some. If they have none, total is two, which meets the bid. If they have one or more, even better. So bidding two 7s is also safe.\n\nBut which digit is better to bid on? Since 7 is higher than 4, starting with a higher digit might make the next player have to bid higher. For example, if I bid two 7s, the next player can either bid three of any digit or two of a higher digit (8 or 9). But since the digits go up to 9, higher digits are 8 and 9. If the next player has, say, two 8s, they can bid two 8s, which is higher than two 7s. Alternatively, they could bid three of a lower digit.\n\nBut if I bid two 7s, and the next player has a hand with, say, three 2s, they might bid three 2s, which is higher in quantity. So that's a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, if I bid two 4s, the next player could bid two 5s, 6s, etc., or three of any digit.\n\nSo maybe starting with a higher digit is better because it limits the opponent's options for same-quantity higher-digit bids. For example, if I bid two 7s, the opponent can only bid two 8s or two 9s, which might be less likely, forcing them to increase the quantity.\n\nBut considering that the opponent's hand is unknown, it's hard to predict. However, since the first bid is safe if I bid a quantity that I already have in my hand, because even if the opponent has none, the total is equal to my bid, which is valid.\n\nSo, between two 4s and two 7s, both are safe. But 7 is a higher digit, so maybe better to start with that. Let's check: if I bid two 7s, and the opponent has, say, one 7, the total is three, which is more than the bid. If they have none, total is two, which meets the bid. So it's safe. Therefore, bidding two 7s is a solid opening.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower digit but higher quantity. For example, three 2s. But I only have one 2. The opponent would need two 2s for the total to be three. If they have none, the total is one, which is less than three, so if they challenge, I lose. Risky.\n\nSo the safest options are two 4s or two 7s. Between those, 7 is a higher digit, which might make the next player's bid more constrained. Therefore, I'll go with two 7s.\n"
