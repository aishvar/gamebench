        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 4s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Looking at my hand, 06876152, I have one 4, but I also notice I have two 6s and other digits. Since the bid history shows a progression from 1 7s to 2 6s to 3 4s, it seems players are trying to find a balance between the quantity and the digit value. Considering my hand and the fact that I don't have enough information to confidently challenge the bid of 3 4s without knowing the other player's hand, making a bid that increases either the quantity or the digit seems like a strategic move. Given that I have two 6s, bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity or increasing the quantity with a lower digit could be viable. However, since I only have one 5 and no higher digits in significant numbers, increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same or slightly higher seems reasonable. Thus, bidding on 3 6s would be a logical next step, as it maintains the same quantity but increases the digit value, leveraging the information from my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 6s\"\n}",
