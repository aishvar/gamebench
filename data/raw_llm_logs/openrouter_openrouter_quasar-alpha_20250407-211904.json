For the total to be at least 4, the opponent would need to have at least two more 1s. Since each player has 8 digits, it's plausible but somewhat aggressive. However, it's still within reason and not highly unlikely. Instead of challenging now, a safer approach is to increase the bid to a higher digit count that's supported by my hand. I have two 0s, so bidding 4 zeros is an equal quantity bid but on a higher digit, which is valid and strategic. Alternatively, I can bid 5 of any digit, but that might be risky. So, I'll bid 4 zeros.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 0s\"\n}",
