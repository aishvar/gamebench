        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 1s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at my hand. My digits are 0, 9, 2, 3, 0, 8, 9, 5. So, let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\nLooking at the digits, I have two 0s, one 2, one 3, one 5, one 8, and two 9s. So, the counts for each digit in my hand are: 0:2, 2:1, 3:1, 5:1, 8:1, 9:2. The other digits like 1, 4, 6, 7 don't appear in my hand.\n\nNow, the current bid is 2 1s made by Player 0. My goal is to either make a higher bid or challenge if I think it's too high.\n\nLet's think about the possible counts of 1s. Since there are 8 digits per player and there are two players, the total possible digits are 16. I have zero 1s in my hand, so the other player must have all the 1s if there are any.\n\nIf Player 0 bid 2 1s, they might be trying to bluff, thinking I don't have any 1s. But since I don't have any 1s, the total number of 1s in the game is whatever Player 0 has. If they have at least two 1s, the bid is valid. But if they have less than two, then the bid is a lie.\n\nConsidering that, if I challenge, and it turns out there are fewer than two 1s, I win. But if there are two or more, Player 0 wins. Since I don't have any 1s, the only source of 1s is Player 0. So, if they have two or more 1s, they're telling the truth. But if they have one or none, they're lying.\n\nGiven that, challenging might be a good move because it's a high risk for Player 0. They might not have two 1s, especially since they're going first and might be trying to bluff. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I could consider making a bid higher than 2 1s. \n\nWhat's the next possible bid? It could be either 3 of any digit or 2 of a higher digit than 1. Since 1 is the lowest, the next higher digit is 2. So, I could bid 2 2s, but I only have one 2, so that's risky. Alternatively, I could bid 3 of any digit I have more of. I have two 0s and two 9s. So, I could bid 3 0s or 3 9s. \n\nIf I bid 3 0s, I have two 0s, so I'm assuming Player 0 has at least one more 0. If they do, the bid is valid. If not, it's a bluff. Similarly, for 3 9s, I have two 9s, so again, assuming Player 0 has at least one more. \n\nBut considering that the current bid is 2 1s, which is a low quantity and a low digit, maybe challenging is better because it's a high risk for Player 0. They might not have two 1s, especially since they went first. \n\nAlternatively, making a bid could be safer, but I have to consider what digits I have. If I bid 3 0s, I have two, so I'm hoping Player 0 has one. If they don't, I lose. Similarly for 9s. \n\nChallenging might be the better move because it's a higher risk for Player 0. They might not have two 1s, and since I don't have any, it's all on them. So, I think challenging is the way to go.\n"
