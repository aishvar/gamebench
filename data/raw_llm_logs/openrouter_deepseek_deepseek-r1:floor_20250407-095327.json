You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "refusal": null,
                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. My hand is 6,6,2,5,1,0,9,5. So I have two 6s, one 2, two 5s, a 1, a 0, and a 9. The current bid is 2 6s from Player 0. I need to make a higher bid or challenge.\n\nFirst, the bid history shows Player 0 started with 2 2s, then I bid 2 5s, and they came back with 2 6s. Now it's my turn. Since the last bid is 2 6s, I need to either bid higher. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity but use a higher digit.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 6s. But the opponent bid 2 6s. So if I bid 3 of any digit, that would be higher in quantity. Alternatively, if I can bid the same quantity (2) but a higher digit than 6. The digits go up to 9, so 7,8,9. Do I have any of those? In my hand, I have a 9. But even if I don't have those digits, the bid is about all players' hands combined. But I don't know the opponent's hand.\n\nIf I bid 2 7s, that's higher than 2 6s. But do I think there are at least two 7s in total? Since I have zero 7s in my hand, the opponent would need to have at least two 7s. That's possible but maybe unlikely. Alternatively, increasing the quantity to 3. For example, 3 5s. Wait, the previous bid was 2 6s. So 3 5s would be higher in quantity (3 > 2), even though 5 is lower than 6. Because the rule says higher quantity takes precedence over digit. So 3 5s is a valid higher bid than 2 6s.\n\nBut in my hand, I have two 5s. So if I bid 3 5s, that means I'm guessing the opponent has at least one 5. If they have one 5, total would be three. That's possible. Alternatively, if I bid 3 6s. Since I have two 6s, the opponent needs to have at least one more. If they have at least one, then total is three, which would make my bid valid. But do I want to risk that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 9s. Since 9 is higher than 6, and same quantity. But I only have one 9. So opponent would need to have at least one. Possible, but again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, challenge. The current bid is 2 6s. I have two 6s. So the total number of 6s is at least two (my two plus whatever the opponent has). Wait, no. Wait, the opponent's bid is 2 6s. If the opponent has any 6s, then the total would be at least two (my two plus theirs). But the opponent could have zero. Wait, but the current bid is 2 6s. If I have two, and the opponent has zero, the total is two, which meets the bid. So if the bid is 2 6s, and the actual count is two, then challenging would lose because the count is exactly two. So challenging now would be bad because even if the opponent has zero, the total is two, which meets their bid of 2 6s. Therefore, challenging is not a good idea here because the bid is exactly met by my own hand. So I can't challenge here.\n\nTherefore, I need to bid higher. Let's consider options. If I bid 3 5s, that's higher in quantity. I have two 5s, so opponent needs at least one. If they have one, total three. If they have none, then total two, which is less than three. So that's risky. Alternatively, bid 3 6s. I have two, so opponent needs at least one. If they have one, total three. If they have none, total two. So same risk. But maybe they are more likely to have a 6 since they bid 2 6s. Wait, why did they bid 2 6s? Maybe they have some 6s. Or maybe they were just raising the digit. Let's see the bid history: They started with 2 2s, I bid 2 5s (maybe because I have two 5s), then they bid 2 6s. Maybe they have a 6, which would make their bid of 2 6s possibly accurate. For example, if they have one 6, then total is three (my two + their one). Wait, but their bid is 2 6s. So if the actual count is three, their bid is valid. But they could have bid 3 6s if they had a 6. But they only bid 2. Hmm. Maybe they don't have any 6s. Because if they had a 6, they might have bid 3 6s. But instead, they just increased the digit from 5 to 6, keeping the quantity at 2. So maybe they have a 6, but not enough to raise the quantity. Or maybe they're bluffing.\n\nSo if I bid 3 5s, and they have one 5, then total is three. But if they don't, then I lose. Alternatively, bid 2 7s. But I have zero 7s. So opponent needs at least two. Unlikely. Or bid 2 9s. I have one, so they need one. Possible. But 9 is a high digit, and maybe they have some. But it's uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, bid 3 2s. Since the quantity is higher. The current bid is 2 6s. 3 2s is higher because quantity 3 > 2. But do I have any 2s? In my hand, I have one 2. So opponent would need to have two 2s. Possible? Maybe. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, bid 3 0s. I have one 0. Opponent would need two. Possible but risky.\n\nAlternatively, bid 2 7s. As before, but I have none.\n\nHmm. Considering all options, the safest bid might be to increase the quantity. Since if I bid 3 5s, and I have two, then maybe the opponent has one. But given that I bid 2 5s earlier, and they didn't challenge, maybe they have at least one 5. Because if they didn't, they might have challenged my 2 5s. Wait, when I bid 2 5s, they had the option to challenge. But they didn't; they bid 2 6s instead. That suggests that they don't want to challenge my 2 5s, which could mean that they have at least one 5, making the total at least three (my two plus their one). If that's the case, then bidding 3 5s could be safe. Because the total would be at least three. Alternatively, maybe they have zero 5s and were just trying to raise the bid. But if they had zero 5s, they could have challenged my 2 5s, which would have required the total to be at least two. If they have zero, then total is two (my two), so challenging would lose. So they might have chosen not to challenge because they have at least one 5, making the total three. Therefore, bidding 3 5s is a safe move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 3 6s. But I have two, and if they have one, total is three. But since they bid 2 6s, they might have one. Because if they had two 6s, they could have bid 3 6s. But they only bid 2. So maybe they have one. So 3 6s would be valid if they have one. But if they have none, then total is two, which would make my bid invalid. So it's a risk.\n\nBut considering the previous bid of 2 5s, which they didn't challenge, maybe they have at least one 5. So 3 5s is safer. So the action would be to bid 3 5s.\n"
