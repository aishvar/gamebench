        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 3 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 24 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

            "TextBlock(citations=None, text='{\"reasoning\": \"I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid of \\'3 9s\\'. Looking at my hand (63005973), I have 0 nines. Since there are 3 players with 8 digits each, there are 24 total digits in play. Player 1 has bid that there are at least 3 nines total. Given that I have 0 nines, this means Players 0 and 1 would need to have at least 3 nines between them. This is certainly possible - Player 0\\'s initial bid of \\'2 9s\\' suggests they have at least 1 or 2 nines. I could challenge, but it\\'s too risky at this early stage with such a low bid. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I have one 0, one 3, one 5, one 6, one 7, and two 9s in my hand. I could bid \\'4 0s\\', but I only have one 0 myself. A safer option would be to bid \\'4 3s\\' or \\'4 5s\\' or \\'4 6s\\' or \\'4 7s\\', but again I only have one of each. I think the safest bid is to increase the quantity to 4 and choose a digit I have more of, or to keep the quantity at 3 but choose a higher digit. Since I don\\'t have any digit more than once except for 9 (which I can\\'t bid since it\\'s not higher than the current bid), I\\'ll go with \\'4 0s\\'.\", \"action\": \"BID: 4 0s\"}', type='text')"
