My hand contains zero 6s. For the current bid '2 6s' to be true, Player 0 must hold at least two 6s in their 8-digit hand. This is plausible, making a challenge somewhat risky, especially this early with a low bid.\\n2. I need to find a valid higher bid (more than 2 quantity, or same quantity with a digit higher than 6).\\n3. I have three 7s in my hand. Bidding '2 7s' would be a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and is guaranteed to be true since I hold three 7s.\\n4. Bidding '3 7s' is also a valid higher bid (higher quantity) and is also guaranteed to be true based solely on my hand (I have three 7s).\\n5. Comparing '2 7s' and '3 7s', the bid '3 7s' is stronger as it increases the quantity while still being completely safe for me. It puts more pressure on the opponent.\\n6. Therefore, making the safe and higher bid of '3 7s' is the best strategic move.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 7s\"\n}\n```",
