For this bid to be true, Player 1 needs to have at least two 7s (since I have two). Player 1 previously bid 3 7s and then raised to 4 7s, suggesting they might have at least one or two 7s, making a challenge risky. I previously bid 2 8s and 3 8s. A bid of 4 8s is a valid next bid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires Player 1 to have at least two 8s (since I have two). This is statistically plausible (expected number in 8 unknown digits is 0.8, needing 2 is possible). Bidding 4 8s continues my established pattern, is a relatively safe increment, and puts the pressure back on Player 1, who might not have many 8s given they switched to bidding 7s over my 3 8s bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 8s\"\n}\n```",
