Since the total count across both hands is at least 2, the current bid is plausible. Raising to 3 9s would require at least one more 9 in Player 0's hand, which is possible but uncertain. A safer strategic move is to increase the bid by quantity or digit without overcommitting. I can bid 2 of a higher digit, such as 2 7s or 2 8s, but since I also have two 7s and one 8, bidding 3 7s is risky. Alternatively, I can bid 3 2s, since I have two 2s, and just one more 2 in their hand would satisfy that bid. This is a safer incremental bid. Therefore, the best move is to bid 3 2s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 2\"\n}",
