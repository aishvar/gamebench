        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 4s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since the bid is about the total count across both players' hands, and considering the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, bidding higher requires careful consideration. The current bid seems somewhat conservative, but without knowing the other player's hand, it's hard to gauge its accuracy. However, I also have a couple of 5s and other digits, which might give me an edge in bidding on a different digit or increasing the quantity slightly. Given that I only have one 4 and no 4s higher than the current bid would be a significant jump, I'll consider bidding on a different digit that I have more of, like the 5s or 9s, but increasing the quantity might be risky without more information. Since I have two 9s and one 5, and given that the current bid is on 4s, I could attempt to increase the digit or the quantity based on my hand's composition. However, considering the risk and the fact that I don't have enough information to safely increase the quantity of 4s or confidently bid on another digit without potentially overbidding, I should consider challenging the current bid if it seems unlikely or make a cautious bid. Given my hand and the need to make a strictly higher bid, I will choose to bid on a digit I have, aiming to balance the risk of overbidding with the potential reward of winning the round.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 5s\"\n}",
