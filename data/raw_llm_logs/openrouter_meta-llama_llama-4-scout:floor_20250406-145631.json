        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 3 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 1s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 24 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

Since my hand is 36871454, I can see I have a 1, which could contribute to a higher bid if others have more 1s. However, I also have other digits that could potentially be higher. I have three 6s and other digits, but no other 1s. I should consider bidding on a digit I have or increasing the quantity slightly if I think others might have more of that digit. Given I have one 1 and the bid is only for 3 1s, I should consider if I can safely bid higher on a digit I have. I have one 1, so bidding on 1s or another digit with a higher quantity seems reasonable. I have no 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, or 7s, but I do have several other digits. A safe bet is to bid higher on a digit I have, like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. Among these, 4, 5, and 6 seem promising because I have multiple instances of them.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}",
