        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out what to do here. I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. The current bid is None, so I have to make the first bid. \n\nFirst, I look at my hand: 29142497. Let me count the digits I have. Breaking it down:\n\n- 2 appears twice.\n- 9 appears twice.\n- 1 appears once.\n- 4 appears twice.\n- 7 appears once.\n\nSo, I have two 2s, two 9s, two 4s, and one each of 1 and 7. \n\nSince I'm starting, I can bid on any digit. I need to choose a digit that I think will give me a good chance of winning. Let's think about the possible bids.\n\nIf I bid on a digit I have multiple of, that might be safer. For example, I have two 2s. If I bid 3 2s, that means I'm claiming there are at least three 2s in total (including both players). But wait, the maximum is 16, so that's possible, but I only have two. I don't know what the other player has, so it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit, like 9. I have two 9s. If I bid 3 9s, that's a higher digit than 2, which might be better. But again, I don't know what the other player has.\n\nAnother option is to bid on a lower digit but with a higher quantity. For example, I have two 4s. Maybe I could bid 4 4s. But that's a higher quantity than I have, so it's a bit risky.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the likelihood of the other player having certain digits. Since I have two 9s, it's possible the other player might have some 9s as well. But I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should bid on a digit that's less likely to be overbid. For example, if I bid 3 2s, maybe the other player won't have enough to overbid. But the other player could have more 2s.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should go with a digit that I have multiple of and bid a quantity slightly higher than what I have. So, for 9s, I have two. Maybe I bid 3 9s. That way, if the other player has at least one 9, the total would be three, making my bid valid.\n\nBut wait, if I bid 3 9s, the other player could challenge if they think there aren't enough. Alternatively, they might have to make a higher bid, which could be risky for them.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a lower digit with a higher quantity. For example, I have two 4s. If I bid 4 4s, that's a higher quantity but same digit. But I'm not sure if that's better.\n\nWait, in Liar's Poker, the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid. Since the current bid is None, I can choose any quantity and digit. But I should choose a bid that's likely to be true and hard for the opponent to overbid.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should bid on a digit that I have multiple of and a quantity that's achievable. Let's say I bid 3 9s. That's a higher digit and a reasonable quantity. If the other player doesn't have any 9s, the total would be two, which is less than three, so I would lose if they challenge. But if they have at least one 9, the total would be three or more, making my bid valid.\n\nAlternatively, if I bid 3 2s, same logic applies. But 9s are a higher digit, so that might be better.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe I should consider the distribution of digits. Since I have two 9s, it's possible the opponent has some 9s, but it's also possible they don't. If I bid 3 9s, and the opponent has none, the total is two, which is less than three, so they can challenge and win. But if they have at least one 9, the total is three, making my bid valid.\n\nAlternatively, if I bid on a digit I have only one of, like 7, and bid 2 7s. That's possible if the opponent has one 7. But I have only one, so it's risky.\n\nHmm, perhaps the safest bid is to go with a digit I have two of and bid three. So, 3 9s.\n\nWait, but what if the opponent has zero 9s? Then the total is two, and my bid is invalid. They can challenge, and I lose.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should bid on a digit I have only one of but with a lower quantity. For example, bid 2 7s. If the opponent has one, the total is two, making my bid valid. If they have none, the total is one, which is less than two, so they can challenge.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should bid on a lower digit but with a higher quantity. For example, bid 4 4s. I have two, so if the opponent has two, the total is four, making my bid valid. If they have one, the total is three, which is less than four, so they can challenge.\n\nBut I think it's better to bid on a higher digit with a slightly higher quantity. So, 3 9s.\n\nWait, but I have two 9s. If I bid 3 9s, the opponent can challenge if they think there aren't enough. But if they have at least one, the total is three or more, making my bid valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should bid 4 9s. But that's a higher quantity, which is riskier. I have two, so if the opponent has two, the total is four, making my bid valid. But if they have one, the total is three, which is less than four, so they can challenge.\n\nHmm, maybe 3 9s is better because it's a safer quantity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should bid on a digit I have one of but with a lower quantity. For example, bid 2 7s. If the opponent has one, the total is two, making my bid valid. If they have none, the total is one, which is less than two, so they can challenge.\n\nBut I think it's better to bid on a digit I have multiple of.\n\nSo, I think I'll go with 3 9s. That's a higher digit and a reasonable quantity based on my hand.\n"
