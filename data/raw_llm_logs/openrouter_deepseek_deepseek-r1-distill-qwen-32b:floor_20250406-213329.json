        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let's start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, my hand is 47499577. Let me count the digits I have: \n\n- 4 appears twice (positions 1 and 3)\n- 7 appears three times (positions 2, 5, 7, 8) wait, no, let me recount: position 2 is 7, position 5 is 5, position 6 is 9, position 7 is 7, position 8 is 7. So that's three 7s.\n- 9 appears twice (positions 4 and 6)\n- 5 appears once (position 5)\n- 4 appears twice (positions 1 and 3)\n- 9 appears twice (positions 4 and 6)\nWait, I think I miscounted. Let me list them out:\n\nDigits: 4,7,4,9,9,5,7,7.\n\nSo:\n\n- 4: 2 times\n- 7: 3 times\n- 9: 2 times\n- 5: 1 time\n\nOkay, so I have two 4s, three 7s, two 9s, and one 5.\n\nThe current bid is 2 6s from Player 0. So the last bid is 2 6s. My turn is to either make a higher bid or challenge.\n\nNow, the rules say that a higher bid can be made by either increasing the quantity or, if the quantity is the same, increasing the digit. So, for example, from 2 6s, a higher bid could be 3 6s or 2 7s, or even 3 7s, etc.\n\nI need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge.\n\nLet me think about the possible counts of 6s. The current bid is 2 6s. So the total number of 6s across both players is at least 2. But since I don't have any 6s in my hand, that means Player 0 must have at least 2 6s in their hand because I have zero. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true because the total across both players could be 2. But since I have zero, Player 0 must have at least 2 6s.\n\nWait, but the total number of digits is 16 (8 each). So if the current bid is 2 6s, the actual count could be 2 or more. But since I have zero 6s, the count is entirely in Player 0's hand. So if Player 0 has 2 6s, that's possible. But could they have more? Well, they could have more, but the current bid is 2, so they're claiming that there are at least 2 6s.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. If I challenge, we'll reveal the actual count. If the count is less than 2, I win. But since I have zero 6s, the count is whatever Player 0 has. So if Player 0 has exactly 2 6s, then the bid is correct, and they win. If they have less than 2, which is impossible because I have zero, so the count is exactly what they have. So if they have 2 6s, the bid is correct. If they have less, which can't happen because I have none, then the count is less than 2, but that would mean they have 0 or 1. But since the bid was 2 6s, if they have less, they lose. But I don't know what they have.\n\nWait, but in reality, since I have zero 6s, the total count is whatever Player 0 has. So if Player 0 has 2 6s, the count is 2, so their bid is correct. If they have less, say 1 or 0, then the count is less than 2, so their bid is wrong, and I win.\n\nBut the problem is, I don't know how many 6s Player 0 has. They could have 2 or more. So challenging is risky because if they actually have 2 or more, I lose. But if they have less, I win.\n\nAlternatively, I could make a higher bid. Let's see what options I have.\n\nI have three 7s. So if I bid 3 7s, that would be a higher bid than 2 6s because the quantity is higher. Alternatively, I could bid 3 6s, but I don't have any 6s, so that's risky because I'm claiming there are at least 3 6s in total, but I don't have any, so Player 0 would have to have 3 or more. But I don't know if they do.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 7s, which is higher than 2 6s because the digit is higher. But since I have three 7s, that's a strong position. So bidding 2 7s would be a valid higher bid.\n\nWait, but the current bid is 2 6s. So to make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. So 2 7s is a higher bid because the digit is higher, even though the quantity is the same.\n\nSo, considering that, I could bid 2 7s. But I have three 7s, so I can also bid 3 7s, which would be even higher.\n\nBut I need to consider the likelihood of the current bid being correct. If I challenge, and the count is 2 6s, I lose. But if I make a higher bid, I'm making a claim that there are more 7s than 6s.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 7s, which is a higher quantity than 2 6s. Since I have three 7s, that's a solid position. I can confidently say there are at least three 7s because I have three myself, and Player 0 might have some as well.\n\nWait, but the total count could be more than three. For example, if Player 0 also has some 7s, the total could be higher. But if I bid 3 7s, I'm only claiming that there are at least three, which is true because I have three. So that's a safe bid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 7s, which is also higher than 2 6s. But since I have three, maybe bidding higher is better.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the best move is to make a higher bid. Since I have three 7s, bidding 3 7s would be a valid higher bid than 2 6s. It's a safe move because I know I have three, so the total count is at least three.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider other digits. I have two 4s and two 9s. So I could bid 2 9s, which is higher than 2 6s because 9 is higher than 6. But I have two 9s, so the total count could be more if Player 0 has any. But I'm not sure.\n\nBut since I have three 7s, which is a higher quantity, I think bidding 3 7s is a stronger move.\n\nWait, but the current bid is 2 6s. So if I bid 3 7s, that's higher in quantity and digit. That's a valid bid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 7s, which is higher in digit but same quantity. But since I have three, maybe bidding higher quantity is better.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to bid 3 7s.\n"
