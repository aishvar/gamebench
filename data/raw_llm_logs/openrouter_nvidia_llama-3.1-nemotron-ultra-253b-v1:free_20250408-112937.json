Let's count my own digits first. I have two 1s, two 4s, two 7s, one 8, one 9. The current bid is 3 2s. Since I don't have any 2s, but the opponent might have some. The total number of 2s in the game could be up to 8 (if the opponent has all 2s), but that's unlikely. However, the bid is 3 2s. To challenge, I need to be confident that the total 2s are less than 3. Since I have 0, the opponent would need to have at least 3. If their bid is 3 2s, maybe they have some, but without knowing their hand, it's risky. Alternatively, I can make a higher bid. The rules say higher quantity or same quantity with higher digit. The current bid is 3 2s. To make a higher bid, I can go for 4 of any digit or 3 of a higher digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, but 1 is lower than 2, so 3 1s would be invalid. However, I have two 4s. If I bid 3 4s, that's same quantity but higher digit (4 > 2), which is valid. Do I think there are at least 3 4s in total? I have two 4s. If the opponent has at least one 4, then total is 3. But I don't know their hand. Alternatively, maybe bid 4 of a digit I have more of. Wait, I have two 7s. If I bid 4 7s, but I only have two, so unless the opponent has two, which is possible. But that's a risk. Alternatively, maybe 3 7s. Since 7 is higher than 2, 3 7s would be a valid higher bid. But do I think there are at least 3 7s? I have two, so opponent needs at least one. It's possible. Alternatively, maybe 3 9s. I have one 9. Opponent might have none. So total 1. Then 3 9s would be a bad bid. Alternatively, 3 8s. I have one 8. Opponent might have one or two. Maybe. Alternatively, maybe increasing the quantity. The current bid is 3 2s. If I bid 4 2s, but that's increasing the quantity. However, since I have 0 2s, opponent would need to have 4. That's possible, but risky. Alternatively, 4 of a different digit. For example, 4 1s. I have two 1s. If opponent has two, that's 4. But opponent's bid was 3 2s, maybe they don't have many 1s. So maybe 4 1s is a possible bid. But if I have two 1s, and the opponent has two, that's 4. But if they have less, then it's a bad bid. Alternatively, maybe 4 4s. I have two, so opponent needs two. Maybe. Alternatively, 4 7s. I have two, opponent needs two. It's possible. But this is all speculative. Another approach: since the current bid is 3 2s, and I have no 2s, maybe challenging is better. If I challenge, and the total 2s are less than 3, I win. But if the opponent has three or more 2s, I lose. Since I don't know their hand, but they bid 3 2s, maybe they have some. But in Liar's Poker, players often bluff. So maybe the bid is a bluff. If I have no 2s, the maximum the opponent can have is 8 (if all their digits are 2s). But that's highly unlikely. The probability that they have at least three 2s is... Well, in their 8 digits, the number of 2s could be 0-8. But without any information, it's hard to tell. However, since they increased the bid from 3 1s to 3 2s, maybe they have some 2s. But maybe they are just shifting the digit. Alternatively, maybe they have a weak hand and are trying to shift the bid. Hmm. This is tricky. Given that I have two 4s and two 7s, maybe making a higher bid with 3 of those digits is better. For example, 3 4s. Since 4 is higher than 2, that's a valid bid. If I have two 4s, the opponent needs at least one. If they have one, then total is 3. If not, then it's 2. So there's a risk. But maybe it's better than challenging. Alternatively, if I bid 3 7s. Same logic. Alternatively, maybe increasing the quantity to 4. For example, 4 4s. But that requires the opponent to have two 4s. If they don't, then the total is 2 (mine) + 0 (theirs) = 2 < 4. So that's a bad bid. So maybe safer to do 3 4s. Alternatively, 3 5s. But I have no 5s. Opponent might have some. But that's a shot in the dark. Alternatively, 3 3s. No, I have no 3s. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 3 6s. No 6s in my hand. So, considering all this, maybe the safest higher bid is 3 4s. Because I have two, and if the opponent has at least one, it's valid. Since they might have shifted from 3 1s to 3 2s, maybe they don't have many 4s. But it's possible. Alternatively, maybe I should challenge. If I challenge the 3 2s, and there are less than 3, I win. But if there are 3 or more, I lose. Since I have none, the opponent needs to have 3. The chance that their 8 digits contain at least 3 2s. Let's calculate the probability. But without knowing the distribution, it's hard. However, in a real game, players might bluff. So maybe the bid is a bluff, and they don't have three 2s. So challenging could be a good move. Alternatively, if I bid 3 4s, and they challenge, then if there are less than 3 4s, I lose. But I have two, so opponent needs at least one. If they have none, then total is 2, and I lose. So it's risky. Hmm. So, what's the better option? If I think the opponent is bluffing the 3 2s, then challenging is good. If I think they actually have some 2s, then making a higher bid is better. Since they increased from 3 1s to 3 2s, maybe they are just changing the digit, not necessarily having 2s. Maybe they have a 2 and want to shift the bid. Alternatively, they might have a couple of 2s. It's hard to tell. Given that my hand has no 2s, challenging might be risky but could pay off. Alternatively, making a higher bid shifts the pressure to them. Let's see the example in the problem statement. In example 2, the bid was 11 8s, which is very high, so challenging is good. Here, the bid is 3 2s. Not as extreme. So maybe making a higher bid is safer. So, I'll go with bidding 3 4s. Because 4 is higher than 2, so it's a valid higher bid. I have two 4s, so if the opponent has at least one, the bid is good. If they challenge, and there are only two 4s, I lose. But maybe they won't challenge. Alternatively, they might think I have more 4s. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe bid 3 7s. Same logic. I have two 7s. So, 3 7s. But 7 is higher than 2, so it's a valid bid. Maybe that's better. Let's see. If I bid 3 7s, and the opponent has one 7, then total is 3. If they have none, then it's 2. So, similar risk. Alternatively, maybe 3 9s. I have one 9. Opponent needs two. Unlikely. So, probably not. So, between 3 4s and 3 7s. Both have two in my hand. Maybe 3 7s is better because 7 is higher than 4, making it a stronger bid. Wait, the bid is about the digit, not the strength. The higher digit just allows the same quantity. So, 3 7s is higher than 3 2s. So, either 3 4s or 3 7s. Which one is better? Maybe 3 7s, since I have two 7s, and maybe the opponent is less likely to have 7s. Or maybe not. It's hard to say. Alternatively, maybe 4 1s. I have two 1s. If I bid 4 1s, opponent needs to have two. But since the previous bid was 3 1s by me, and they increased to 3 2s, maybe they don't like 1s. So, maybe they have few 1s. So, 4 1s could be a good bid. Wait, but the current bid is 3 2s. To bid 4 1s, the quantity is higher (4 > 3), so it's valid. But 1 is lower than 2, but quantity is higher. So, yes, 4 1s is a valid bid. Do I have two 1s. So, if I bid 4 1s, I need the opponent to have two 1s. If they have two, total is 4. If they have one, total is 3. If they have none, total is 2. So, it's risky. But maybe they have some 1s. Alternatively, since they increased the bid from 3 1s to 3 2s, maybe they were afraid of the 1s, suggesting they don't have many. So, maybe they have 0 or 1 1s. So, 4 1s would be a bad bid. Hmm. This is complicated. Maybe the safest higher bid is 3 4s or 3 7s. Let's pick 3 4s. So, the action would be 'BID: 3 4s'. Alternatively, maybe 3 7s. Let me check my hand again: 87491147. So, digits are 8,7,4,9,1,1,4,7. Yes, two 4s and two 7s. So, either 3 4s or 3 7s. Let's go with 3 4s. The reasoning is that I have two 4s, and by bidding 3 4s, I'm hoping the opponent has at least one. Since they might not want to challenge if they have one, because then the total would be 3. Alternatively, if they have none, they might challenge. But it's a calculated risk. Alternatively, maybe I should challenge. Let's think again. If I challenge, and the total 2s are less than 3, I win. Since I have 0, the opponent needs to have 3. The chance that their 8 digits have at least 3 2s. Let's think about the probability. Assuming random distribution, the probability that 8 digits have at least 3 2s. But in Liar's Poker, players don't have random hands; they might have strategic hands. However, since it's early in the game, maybe hands are random. The probability of at least 3 2s in 8 digits: the number of 2s in 8 digits follows a binomial distribution. The probability of exactly k 2s is C(8, k) * (1/10)^k * (9/10)^(8-k). Summing from k=3 to 8. Let's approximate: P(3) = 8C3 * (1/10)^3 * (9/10)^5 \u2248 56 * 0.001 * 0.59049 \u2248 0.0331. P(4) = 8C4 * (1/10)^4 * (9/10)^4 \u2248 70 * 0.0001 * 0.6561 \u2248 0.00459. P(5) = 8C5 * (1/10)^5 * (9/10)^3 \u2248 56 * 0.00001 * 0.729 \u2248 0.000409. Higher k is negligible. Total \u2248 0.0331 + 0.00459 + 0.000409 \u2248 0.0381, so about 3.8% chance. So, there's a 3.8% chance the opponent has 3 or more 2s. Therefore, challenging has a 96.2% chance of success. That's a high probability. So, maybe challenging is the better option. Wait, but this is assuming the opponent's hand is random. But in reality, the opponent might have adjusted their bid based on their hand. They initially bid 3 1s, then I bid 3 1s, then they bid 3 2s. Wait, the bid history is: Player 0 bid 3 1s, Player 1 bid 3 2s. So, the opponent (Player 1) increased the digit from 1 to 2. Maybe they have some 2s, or maybe they are just shifting the digit. If they had 3 1s, they might have just challenged my 3 1s bid. But they didn't, they increased to 3 2s. So, maybe they don't have many 1s, and are trying to shift to a digit they have. But without knowing, it's hard. However, based on pure probability, the chance that they have 3 or more 2s is low (3.8%). Therefore, challenging the 3 2s bid has a high chance of success (96.2%). So, maybe challenging is the better move here. But why did the opponent bid 3 2s? Maybe they have one or two 2s and are bluffing. Or maybe they have none and are just shifting the digit. If they have one 2, then total is 1, and challenging would win. If they have two, total is 2, still less than 3. Only if they have three or more, the challenge fails. Given the low probability, challenging seems good. So, the reasoning is that statistically, the opponent is unlikely to have three 2s, so challenging is a good move. Therefore, the action should be CHALLENGE.\n\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
