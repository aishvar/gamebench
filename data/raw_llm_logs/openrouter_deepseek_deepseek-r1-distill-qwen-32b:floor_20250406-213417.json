You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. Let me think through what I should do. \n\nFirst, I remember the rules: each player has 8 secret digits, and we take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit across both hands. The bid has to be higher than the previous one, either by quantity or by digit if the quantity is the same. If I can't make a higher bid, I can challenge the last bid.\n\nLooking at my hand, it's 58038127. Let me count the digits I have:\n\n- 5 appears once.\n- 8 appears twice.\n- 0 appears once.\n- 3 appears once.\n- 1 appears once.\n- 2 appears once.\n- 7 appears once.\n\nSo, the digits I have are 5, 8, 8, 0, 3, 1, 2, 7. \n\nSince this is the first bid, I can start with any digit. I want to choose a digit that I have a decent amount of, but also considering the opponent might have some. \n\nI have two 8s. Maybe I can bid on 8s. If I bid 2 8s, that's the minimum I can start with. But wait, the current bid is None, so I can set any bid. However, since I have two 8s, maybe I can bid 2 8s. But is that the best move?\n\nAlternatively, I could look at other digits. For example, I have one 5, but maybe the opponent might have more. Or maybe I can go for a higher digit. Let's see, 8 is a high digit, so if I bid 2 8s, it's a solid starting point.\n\nBut wait, I need to think about the maximum possible. The total digits are 16 (8 each). So, if I bid 2 8s, the opponent might have some 8s as well. Maybe they have one or two. But since I have two, the total could be up to four, but that's assuming the opponent has two as well, which they might not.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a lower digit but higher quantity. For example, I have one 0. Maybe bid 1 0s. But that's lower than 2 8s. Hmm.\n\nWait, no. The first bid can be any quantity and digit. So, I can start with 2 8s. That seems reasonable. But maybe I can go higher. Since I have two 8s, the minimum total is two, but the opponent might have more. So, maybe I can bid 3 8s, assuming the opponent has at least one.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's too risky. If I bid 3 8s and the opponent doesn't have any, then the total would be two, which is less than 3, and I would lose. So, maybe I should start with 2 8s.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of. Wait, I have two 8s, which is the highest count in my hand. So, 8s are the best bet.\n\nSo, I think I'll start by bidding 2 8s. That way, I'm setting a low bar, but it's based on my hand. It's a safe starting point.\n"
