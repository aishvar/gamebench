For the current bid to be accurate, the opponent (Player 0) must hold at least three 4s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, this is not guaranteed, making a challenge a potential option. However, a bid of quantity 3 is relatively low early in the game. My hand contains two 8s and two 7s. Bidding based on these pairs is a strong strategy. A bid of '3 7s' would require the opponent to have at least one 7. A bid of '3 8s' would require the opponent to have at least one 8. Both are statistically likely. Bidding '3 8s' is higher than '3 7s' and '3 4s', is well-supported by my hand (I have two 8s), and puts the pressure back on the opponent without making an overly aggressive jump in quantity. It only requires one 8 among the opponent's 8 unknown digits.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 8s\"\n}\n```",
