Given there are 16 digits total and I see zero 4s, the chance that the opponent has both 4s is low, although possible. Raising the bid on 4s would be risky as I hold none. Alternatively, I can consider raising on a digit I have more of. Counting my digits: 3 (2), 8 (1), 9 (2), 0 (2), 1 (1). I have two 3s and two 0s and two 9s, so a safe higher bid would be 3 of any of those digits. The smallest valid higher bid is 3 0s or 3 3s. Since I already have 2 zeros, it's plausible the opponent has at least 1 zero, making 3 0s a reasonable and safe bid that exceeds 2 4s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 0s\"\n}",
