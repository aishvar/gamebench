        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 4s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Let's count the digits: 1 appears three times, 2 once, 5 twice, 7 once, 8 once. The current bid is 4 4s. To challenge, I should consider if the total 4s in all hands could be less than 4. Since I have no 4s, the opponent must have all 4s. They have 8 digits. If they have four 4s, the bid is valid. But it's risky for them to bid exactly their count. Alternatively, I can bid higher. To make a higher bid, I can increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have three 1s, maybe I can bid 5 1s, but that's risky if the opponent has none. Alternatively, bid 4 5s, since I have two 5s. If I have two, the opponent might have two, making total 4. Or maybe 4 7s, but I have one. Alternatively, 4 8s, but I have one. Alternatively, increase the digit with the same quantity: 4 5s is higher than 4 4s. That's a valid bid. So bidding 4 5s is safer than challenging, because challenging relies on the opponent having less than four 4s, which is possible but uncertain. Bidding 4 5s uses my existing 5s and forces the opponent to either challenge or bid higher.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 5s\"\n}",
