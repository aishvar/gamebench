You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and I need to figure out my first move. The game state shows that it's my turn, and the current bid is None, which means I'm starting the bidding. My hand is 14606467, so let me break that down. Each digit is a separate number, right? So that's 1, 4, 6, 0, 6, 4, 6, 7. \n\nFirst, I should count how many of each digit I have. Let's see: \n\n- 0: one\n- 1: one\n- 4: two\n- 6: three\n- 7: one\n\nSo the digits I have are 0,1,4,6,7 with 6 being the most frequent in my hand. Since the total number of digits between both players is 16 (each has 8), I need to think about what's a safe bid.\n\nSince it's the first bid, I can start with any quantity and digit. I want to make a bid that's likely to be true but also gives me an advantage. Looking at my digits, I have three 6s. So if I bid 3 6s, that means together both players have at least three 6s. But wait, I have three 6s myself. So the total could be three or more, but the opponent might have none or some. \n\nIs 3 6s a good starting point? It seems reasonable because I know I have three, so unless the opponent has zero, the bid will hold. But maybe I can go higher. If I bid 4 6s, that would mean the opponent has at least one 6. But I don't know their hand, so that's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I have only one of, like 0 or 1, but that might be too low. Maybe starting with 3 6s is safe. It's a moderate bid, not too high, not too low. Plus, if the opponent challenges, since I have three, the total is at least three, so I would win the challenge. \n\nWait, but can I make a higher bid? Like 4 6s? If I do that, the opponent might challenge, thinking that it's unlikely. But since I have three, the opponent would need at least one for the total to be four. If they have none, I lose. But if they have one or more, I win. \n\nHmm, maybe 3 6s is safer. It's a solid bid, and I know I can back it up. Plus, it's the first move, so starting with a moderate bid might be better than going too high and risking a challenge. \n\nSo, I think I'll bid 3 6s. It's based on my hand, and it's a bid that's likely to be valid. If the opponent challenges, I have a good chance of winning because I have three already. If they don't challenge, the game continues with this bid, and I can strategize further based on their response.\n"
