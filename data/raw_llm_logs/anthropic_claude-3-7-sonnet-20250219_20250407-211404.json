Looking at my hand (81825374), I have zero 0s. Since Player 0 bid that there are 3 zeros total between both our hands, they must believe they have at least 3 zeros in their hand. This is certainly possible, but it means they would need to have a very specific hand with multiple zeros. Given that I have two 8s in my hand, and Player 0\\'s first bid was \\'2 8s\\', it suggests they likely have no 8s (since I already have 2). This makes me somewhat suspicious of their bidding strategy. I could bid \\'3 1s\\' (I have zero 1s), \\'3 2s\\' (I have one 2), \\'3 3s\\' (I have one 3), etc., but I think challenging is the better move here since I have no 0s and their claim requires them to have exactly 3 zeros.\",\\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\\n}\\n```', type='text')"
