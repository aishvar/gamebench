        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 2s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Looking at my hand, 40896694, I notice I have no 2s but I do have multiple occurrences of higher digits. Since I have two 6s and two 9s, and considering the bid needs to be higher in either quantity or digit, bidding on one of these digits could be a good strategy. However, since I don't have enough information about Player 0's hand and given that my highest digits are 9s, I should consider bidding on a digit that I have a good number of, but also consider the likelihood of Player 0 having the same or higher. Given my hand doesn't contain any 2s, and assuming Player 0 might have at least one 2 to make such a bid, I should look to increase the quantity or digit significantly. Bidding on 4 6s seems reasonable because it increases the quantity and moves to a higher digit, both of which are higher than the current bid of '3 2s'.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}",
