        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user is playing Liar's Poker and it's their turn. The current bid is None, so they need to make the first bid. Their hand is 66363720. Let me list out the digits they have:\n\nLooking at their hand: 6, 6, 3, 6, 3, 7, 2, 0. Let me count each digit:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 2: 1\n- 3: 2\n- 6: 3 (since there are three 6s)\n- 7: 1\n\nSo the highest count in their hand is three 6s. Since they have to make the first bid, they can start with that. The bid has to be a quantity and digit. Since it's the first bid, any bid is valid as long as it's a positive quantity. But maybe they can bid 3 6s. But wait, the rules say the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid, which is None. So the first bid can be anything, right?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can bid higher to set a better foundation. But since they have three 6s, maybe they should start with that. Or perhaps they can bid higher, but that might be risky. Since the opponent has 8 digits too, so total digits are 16. If they bid 3 6s, the opponent could have some 6s as well. But since it's the first bid, starting with their own highest count makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe choosing a different digit? Let's see. They have two 3s. But three 6s is better. So the first bid should be 3 6s. That's the logical starting point. There's no previous bid, so that's the initial move. Therefore, the action should be BID: 3 6s. \n\nWait, but maybe they can bid higher? Like 4 6s? But they only have three. That would be a lie, but in Liar's Poker, you can lie. However, the goal is to make a bid that's strategic. Since they have three, maybe bidding 3 is safe, but perhaps they can go higher to pressure the opponent. Hmm. But since it's the first move, maybe starting with their actual count is okay. But in the rules, the bid is about the total count across both hands. So if they have three 6s, the opponent might have some 6s too. The bid is a claim that there are at least X of the digit. So if they bid 3 6s, they're saying there are at least three 6s total. Since they have three, even if the opponent has zero, that's true. So starting with 3 6s is a valid bid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they can start with a higher digit but lower quantity? Like 3 7s, but they only have one 7. That would be a lie. So better to stick with their actual counts. \n\nTherefore, the best first bid is 3 6s. So the action should be BID: 3 6s. The reasoning would be that they have three 6s in their hand, so starting with that as the initial bid makes sense."
