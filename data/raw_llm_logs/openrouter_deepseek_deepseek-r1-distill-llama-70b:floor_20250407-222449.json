        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, let's see. I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. The game state shows that I have the hand \"41237751\". So, my digits are 4, 1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 5, 1. Let me count how many of each digit I have.\n\nLooking at my hand: \n- 0s: 0\n- 1s: 2 (since there are two 1s)\n- 2s: 1\n- 3s: 1\n- 4s: 1\n- 5s: 1\n- 6s: 0\n- 7s: 2\n- 8s: 0\n- 9s: 0\n\nSo, the digits I have are mostly single occurrences except for 1s and 7s, which I have two each. \n\nThe current bid is None, which means this is the first bid of the round. I need to make an opening bid. Since there's no previous bid to compare against, I can start with any quantity and digit. My goal is to make a bid that's likely to be safe but also gives me a strategic advantage.\n\nI remember that in Liar's Poker, a good opening bid is often a low quantity with a high digit because it's harder for the opponent to challenge a high digit without sufficient information. Alternatively, I could bid based on the digits I have to ensure that even if the opponent challenges, I might have a good chance of winning.\n\nLooking at my digits, I have two 7s and two 1s. Since 7 is a high digit, bidding on 7s might be a good idea. If I bid 2 7s, that's a reasonable starting point. It's a low quantity but a high digit, making it less likely that the opponent will immediately challenge, especially if they don't have many 7s themselves.\n\nAnother option is to bid on 1s, but 1 is a low digit, and someone might be more inclined to challenge a bid on a lower digit, thinking it's easier to have fewer of them. So, I think bidding on 7s is safer.\n\nI should also consider the total possible digits. There are 16 digits in play (8 each). If I bid 2 7s, the opponent would have to have 0 or 1 more 7 to make the total 2 or 3. Since I have 2, the total could be 2, 3, etc., depending on their hand. It's a manageable number and not too high, so challenging it might not be beneficial unless the opponent is certain.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid higher, like 3 7s, but that might be risky because I only have 2. If the opponent has at least 1, then the total would be 3, which would make my bid valid. But if they have none, then challenging would cause me to lose. So, 2 seems safer.\n\nI could also consider other digits. For example, I have one 5. If I bid 1 5s, that's possible, but 5 is a middle digit. It might be just as safe, but I think 7s are better because they're higher.\n\nAnother thought: since it's the first bid, starting with a higher digit might set a tone, making the opponent think I have strong cards. It could also make them less likely to challenge immediately.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the best move is to bid 2 7s. It's a safe starting point, uses my strength in 7s, and the high digit makes it less likely to be challenged without good reason.\n"
