        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out the best move here. The current bid is 3 8s by Player 0. My hand is 36371509. So, let me check how many 8s I have. Looking at my digits: 3, 6, 3, 7, 1, 5, 0, 9. Hmm, I don't have any 8s. So, if I have zero 8s, the total number of 8s in the game is whatever Player 0 has.\n\nWait, but each player has 8 digits. So total digits in play are 16. The bid is 3 8s. If I have none, then Player 0 must have at least 3 for the bid to be valid. But I don't know their hand. The question is, should I challenge or make a higher bid?\n\nIf I challenge, then if the total 8s are less than 3, I win. But if they have 3 or more, then Player 0 wins. Since I don't have any, the risk is that Player 0 might have 3 or more. But how likely is that? Let's think. In their hand of 8 digits, how probable is having 3 or more 8s? Well, it's possible, but maybe not super high. But since they made the bid, they might be bluffing or actually have some.\n\nAlternatively, I could make a higher bid. The rules say the bid must be strictly higher. So, either increase the quantity or same quantity with a higher digit. The current bid is 3 8s. So, possible options: 4 of any digit, or 3 of a higher digit (which would be 9). Let's see if I can support a higher bid.\n\nLooking at my hand: 3,6,3,7,1,5,0,9. Let's count my digits. I have two 3s, one 6, one 7, one 1, one 5, one 0, one 9. So, for example, if I bid 4 3s, since I have two, but I don't know how many the opponent has. If they have two 3s, then total would be 4. But that's risky. Alternatively, maybe 4 9s? I have one 9. If I bid 4 9s, then total 9s would need to be at least 4. But I only have one, so opponent would need to have three. That's possible but maybe not safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go for a higher digit with the same quantity. So 3 9s. Since the current bid is 3 8s, 3 9s is a higher bid. Do I think there are at least 3 9s in total? I have one 9. So opponent needs to have two. If they have two 9s, then total is 3. But if they have less, then the bid would fail. But since they made a bid of 3 8s, maybe they don't have many 9s. Alternatively, maybe they have some 9s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can make a higher quantity. Like 4 7s. I have one 7. If I bid 4 7s, then total needs to be at least 4. So opponent needs to have three 7s. That's possible but again, risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 4 5s. I have one 5. Opponent needs three. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 4 6s. I have one 6. Opponent needs three. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 4 0s. I have one 0. Opponent needs three. Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 4 1s. I have one 1. Opponent needs three. Also unlikely.\n\nSo, making a higher quantity bid might be risky because I don't have enough in my hand. The safer option might be to go for a same quantity but higher digit. So 3 9s. Since I have one 9, opponent needs two. If they have two 9s, then total is 3. But how likely is that? Since they bid 3 8s, maybe they have some 8s but not necessarily 9s. But if they have 3 8s, then they might not have many 9s. So maybe 3 9s is a possible bid.\n\nBut then, if I bid 3 9s, and the opponent challenges, then if the total 9s are less than 3, I lose. But if I have one, they need two. If they have two, then it's okay. But if they have one or zero, then the total is 2 or 1, which is less than 3, so I would lose.\n\nAlternatively, maybe challenging is better. If the current bid is 3 8s, and I have zero 8s, then the opponent must have at least 3. If they have 3 or more, then their bid is valid. But since they made the bid, they might be trying to bluff. But if they have 3, then it's a valid bid. So, the question is, do I think they have 3 or more 8s?\n\nIn their hand of 8 digits, the probability of having 3 or more 8s is... Well, it's possible. Let's think: how many 8s are in the entire deck? Assuming it's a standard Liar's Poker",
