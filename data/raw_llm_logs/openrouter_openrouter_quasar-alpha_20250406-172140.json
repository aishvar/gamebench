Given I only have one, it is plausible they have one or more 8s themselves, but since they are naive, they might be guessing or bluffing. The minimum total number of 8s to make their bid true is 2, and I already have one, so it's quite likely there is at least one more in their hand, especially since with 16 digits total, the expected count for any digit is roughly 1.6. The bid of 2 8s is therefore reasonable and not worth challenging. To continue, I need to make a strictly higher bid. The minimal higher bid is 3 8s, but that seems unlikely with only one 8 in my hand. Alternatively, I can bid on a higher digit or a different digit with the same or higher count. Looking at my hand, I have two '4's, so bidding 2 4s is not valid since it is not strictly higher. But I have two '4's, so I can raise to 3 4s, which is a strictly higher bid. Since I already hold two 4s, it is plausible there is at least one more 4 in opponent's hand, making this a reasonable and strategic higher bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"3 4s\"\n}",
