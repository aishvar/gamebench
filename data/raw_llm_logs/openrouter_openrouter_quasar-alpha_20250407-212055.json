The minimal valid raise would be to increase the digit while keeping the count the same, such as bidding 2 8s, since I have one 8 and the chance opponent has another is reasonable. Alternatively, increasing the quantity on 7s to 3 could be risky without more 7s on my side. Thus, the safest strategic move is to bid 2 8s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 8\"\n}",
