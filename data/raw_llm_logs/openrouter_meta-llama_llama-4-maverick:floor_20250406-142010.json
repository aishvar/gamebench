        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 4 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 32 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

Since there are 4 players and each has 8 digits, the total count of any digit across all hands is at most 32. Bidding 5 5s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity, and I have some information about my own hand. However, considering the digit distribution in my hand, I see multiple occurrences of other digits like 5 and 3. I can bid higher on a digit that I know is present in my hand or seems plausible. Bidding 4 6s is a valid option as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit. However, I have one 6, so bidding on 6s might not be very convincing if others have few 6s. I can also consider bidding on a digit that is relatively high and might be less likely to be challenged. Given my hand and the current bid, bidding 4 6s is a reasonable move as it is a higher digit and I have at least one 6.\", \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"}",
