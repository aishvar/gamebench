While it's possible they have exactly 2 or more 9s, it's statistically unlikely for one hand to hold both 9s (probability decreases as the count increases). Given no evidence of 9s on my side and the relatively high bid early in the game, it's reasonable to challenge this bid rather than risk bidding higher on an unlikely scenario.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
