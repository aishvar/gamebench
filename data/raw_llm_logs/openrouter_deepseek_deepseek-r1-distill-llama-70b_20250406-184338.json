You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, the game is just starting because the current bid is 'None' and there's no bid history. That means I'm the first to make a bid. My hand is '10103855'. Let me break that down. Each digit in my hand is: 1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 8, 5, 5. So, I have two 0s, two 1s, one 3, one 8, and two 5s. \n\nSince I'm the first to bid, I need to come up with a starting bid. The rules say that each bid has to be higher than the previous one, but since there's nothing before, I can choose any digit and quantity. My goal is to make a bid that's reasonable but not too high, so I don't set myself up to be challenged right away.\n\nLooking at my digits, I have the most of 0s and 5s\u2014each appears twice. I also have 1s twice. So, maybe I can bid on one of these digits. Let me consider the possible quantities. Since I have two of each, I could start with a bid of 2 on any of these digits. \n\nBut wait, maybe I can go a bit higher to give myself some room. If I bid 3 on 0s, that might be risky because I only have two, and the opponent might have zero or one. Alternatively, bidding 2 on a higher digit might be safer. \n\nWait, another thought: since the maximum any digit can have is 16 (8 from each player), but in reality, the counts are much lower. So, for example, if I bid 3 on 0s, and the opponent has none, the total would be 2, which is less than 3. That would make me lose if challenged. So, maybe starting with a lower quantity is better.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of, like 5s. I have two 5s, so maybe bidding 2 5s is safe. But is that the best move? Or should I pick a higher digit to have more flexibility in future bids?\n\nLet me think about the digits. Higher digits (like 8 or 9) are less likely to be present in large quantities. So, if I bid on a higher digit, even a low quantity might be safe. For example, I have one 8. If I bid 1 8s, that's easy because I know there's at least one. But since I can bid up to 16, maybe I can go a bit higher, but not too much.\n\nWait, but since I'm starting, I don't want to overcommit. Maybe I should pick a digit I have and a quantity that's not too high. Let me count my digits again. I have two 0s, two 1s, two 5s, and one each of 3 and 8. \n\nIf I bid 2 5s, that's a safe start because I have two, and the opponent might have none, making the total exactly two. But if the opponent has one or two, the total could be 3 or 4, which would still make my bid valid. Alternatively, I could bid 3 on a digit I have two of, but that's risky because the opponent might not have any.\n\nHmm, another approach: pick a digit that's less likely to be in the opponent's hand. For example, 8 is a high digit, so maybe the opponent doesn't have many. I have one 8, so if I bid 1 8, that's definitely true. But since I can bid higher, maybe I can go to 2 8s. If the opponent has one, that makes the total 2, which matches the bid. If they have none, then the total is 1, which is less than the bid, so I'd lose if challenged.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 on 0s. Since I have two, and the opponent might have zero or one. If they have one, total is three; if none, total is two. So, 2 0s is a safe bet.\n\nWait, but 0s are common in some cases, but not sure. Maybe 5s are more common. I have two 5s, so bidding 2 5s seems reasonable. It's a low quantity, and the opponent might have one or two, making the total 3 or 4, which is still good.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 on 1s. Same logic applies. But I think 5s might be a better choice because they're a mid-digit, not too high, not too low.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think I'll start with a bid of 2 5s. It's based on my hand, and it's a moderate bid that's likely to be safe but not too aggressive.\n"
