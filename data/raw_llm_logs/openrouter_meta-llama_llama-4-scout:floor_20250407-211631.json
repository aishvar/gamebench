Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and there are 2 players, the total count of '0's across both hands could potentially be higher than 2. However, without knowing Player 0's hand, I must make an educated guess. Since my goal is to make a higher bid or challenge, I should look for a digit in my hand that could potentially be higher than the current bid when considering both hands. I have one '0', so bidding '2 0s' or lower would not be strategic. I see I have several digits, but no other obvious high counts. I will bid on a digit that I have in my hand and seems plausible to be higher than '0'. I have 1 '1', no '1's are bid yet, so I can start with '1 1s'.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 1 1s\"\n}\n```",
