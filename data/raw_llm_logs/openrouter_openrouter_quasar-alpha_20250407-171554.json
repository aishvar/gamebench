Since there are 8 digits in Player 0's hand and Player 0 is naive (50/50), the chance that they have at least one '1' is reasonably high, making the total count of '1's plausibly at least 2. This supports the validity of the current bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or bid a higher digit with the same quantity. Given my hand, I have two '0's, so a bid of 3 0s is plausible. However, from the bid history, Player 0 moved away from zeroes to ones, possibly indicating they have fewer zeroes. Since I have two zeroes, it's risky to bid 3 zeroes without stronger evidence. Alternatively, I could bid 2 2s, but I have only one '2', so it's less safe. The best strategic move is to raise the quantity on '1's to 3, as I have one '1' and it's likely Player 0 has at least one, making a total of 2 or more, but 3 is less certain. Still, statistically, it's a reasonable aggressive bid to maintain pressure.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 1s\"\n}",
