The opponent has 8 digits, so for the current bid of 3 zeros to be true, there must be at least 2 zeros in their hand. Since zeros are less frequent digits, it's somewhat unlikely the opponent holds 2 or more zeros. Also, the opponent's last bid increased from my initial 2 9s to 3 0s, which might be a bluff to shift the digit. Given that I only have 1 zero, the bid of 3 zeros seems risky to accept. Therefore, challenging is statistically reasonable here.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
