The probability that Player 0 has at least one zero among their 8 digits is reasonably high (about 66%), so challenging now is risky. Instead, I should make a safe higher bid. Examining my hand, I have two '9's, so a safe bid is '2 9s'. This is a valid raise and forces Player 0 to respond.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 9\"\n}",
