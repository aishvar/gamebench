        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '5 3s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

Considering the bid history, the bids have progressively increased in digit value while the quantity has remained the same at 5 for the last few bids. Since my hand contains a 3 and there's a possibility that the other player also has a few 3s, bidding higher on the same digit might be risky. However, increasing the digit seems like a plausible strategy. Looking at my hand, I see I have two 0s and other digits but no 4s or higher in significant quantities. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and considering the current bid is 5 3s, a safe increase would be to bid on a higher digit with the same quantity or increase the quantity with a lower digit. Since I don't have enough information to safely increase the quantity of 3s or bid on a higher digit with certainty, and considering my hand doesn't offer a clear advantage for higher digits, I should consider challenging the bid if it seems unlikely or make a strategic bid. Given the history and my hand, challenging seems risky without more information about the opponent's hand, so I'll consider making a bid. Noticing my hand has two 0s and an 8, but the bids have focused on lower digits, I could try to shift focus to a higher digit I have, like 8, but since I only have one 8, bidding on 8s might not be the best strategy without knowing more about the other player's hand. Therefore, the best action seems to be to increase the digit from 3 to the next available digit in my hand that could reasonably appear in both hands, which would be 4 or higher, but since I don't have a 4, I look to the next digit I have multiple of, which isn't present. Thus, considering safety and strategy, I should either challenge or find a reasonable next digit to bid on. Given the constraints and aiming to play it safe while also considering the potential distribution of digits, I decide to challenge the current bid as it's a significant claim and I don't have enough 3s to confidently raise the bid on 3s or move to a higher digit with the same confidence.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
