        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 1s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since the bid is low and I only have one 1, it seems plausible that the total count of 1s could be at least 2 across both players' hands. However, without knowing the other player's hand, I must consider the likelihood of higher bids. Given my hand does not contain any digit more than twice, and considering the low current bid, I can try to increase the bid by quantity or digit. A safe increase would be to bid on a digit I have more of or the same digit with a higher quantity. Since I have two 9s, which is a higher digit, bidding on 9s could be strategic. However, directly bidding on the quantity of a digit I have less of (like 9) might not be the best strategy without more information. Considering the balance between risk and potential gain, and given that I have two 9s which is a significant presence of a high digit, I should consider if the current bid is challengeable or if I should make a bid that is reasonably higher and based on the information I have.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 9s\"\n}",
