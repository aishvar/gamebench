For an opening bid, it's generally strategic to start conservatively yet credibly. Given that I have two 5s, bidding 3 fives seems reasonable, as it is likely the opponent has at least one 5 in their hand, making the total at least 3. This is a safe, strong opening bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 5\"\n}",
