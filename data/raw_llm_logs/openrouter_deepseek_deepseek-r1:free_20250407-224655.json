You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to make the first bid in this Liar's Poker game. My hand is 5, 2, 7, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0. So I have eight digits here. Let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\nLooking at my hand: \n- 0: 1\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 1\n- 4: 3\n- 5: 1\n- 7: 1\n\nSo the most frequent digit in my hand is 4, with three of them. The other digits are single occurrences except for 0 and 1. Since there are two players, each with eight digits, the total number of digits in the game is 16. \n\nSince the current bid is None, I can start with any valid bid. The strategy here is to start with a bid that's based on my own hand but not too high, to avoid being challenged immediately. If I bid based on my 4s, which I have three of, maybe I can assume that the opponent has at least one more 4, making the total four. But that's a bit risky. Alternatively, I could start with a lower quantity but a higher digit.\n\nWait, the rules say that the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid, but since there's no current bid, I can start with any bid. However, the next player will have to bid higher than my bid. So I need to set a starting point that's not too easy to beat but also not too aggressive. \n\nLooking at my hand, the highest count is three 4s. If I bid three 4s, that's a starting point. But maybe I can go a bit higher. For example, if I bid three 5s, but I only have one 5. But the opponent could have more. Alternatively, since 4 is the most common in my hand, maybe starting with three 4s is better. But the opponent might have more 4s, so the total could be higher. But if I bid three 4s, the next player has to either bid a higher quantity (like four of any digit) or a higher digit at the same quantity (like three 5s or higher). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can start with a lower quantity but a higher digit. For example, two 5s. But since I have one 5, maybe the opponent has one, making two total. But that's a bit of a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, considering that there are 16 total digits, the maximum possible for any digit is 16, but that's impossible unless all digits are the same, which is highly unlikely. \n\nSince I have three 4s, and the opponent has eight digits, it's possible they have one or two 4s. So the total could be four or five. If I bid three 4s, the opponent might challenge if they have none, but if they have at least one, then the total is four, which is higher than three. So maybe three 4s is a safe starting bid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can start with a higher quantity but a lower digit. For example, four 2s. But I only have one 2. The opponent might have some, but that's uncertain. \n\nWait, the key is to make a bid that's plausible based on my hand but also makes it hard for the opponent to bid higher without overcommitting. Since I have three 4s, starting with three 4s seems reasonable. If the opponent has at least one 4, the total is four, so they can bid four of something else. But if they don't have any, they might challenge. But since I have three, it's possible that the total is three, but the opponent could have more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start with a lower quantity but a higher digit. For example, two 5s. But I have one 5. If the opponent has one, that's two total. But if they have none, then the total is one, which is less than the bid. So that's risky. \n\nHmm. Maybe the safest initial bid is to use the most common digit in my hand. So three 4s. That way, even if the opponent has none, the total is three, which matches the bid. But wait, the bid is that the total is at least the quantity. So if I bid three 4s, and the total is exactly three, then if someone challenges, I win. But if the opponent has none, then the total is three (since I have three), so the bid is valid. Wait, no: the total is across all players. If I have three 4s, and the opponent has zero, the total is three. So if I bid three 4s, and the opponent challenges, the total is three, which meets the bid, so I win. Therefore, bidding three 4s is safe because even if the opponent has none, the total is three, which matches the bid. Therefore, they can't challenge successfully. \n\nBut wait, the opponent might have more. If I bid three 4s, and the opponent has, say, two 4s, the total is five, which is more than three. So the bid is valid. So in any case, if I bid three 4s, the actual total is at least three. Therefore, the bid is safe. The opponent can't challenge it successfully. Therefore, I should start with three 4s. \n\nAlternatively, could I bid higher? Like four 4s. But I only have three. If the opponent has one, the total is four, which would make the bid valid. But if they have none, the total is three, which is less than four, so the bid would be invalid. So that's risky. So starting with three 4s is safer. \n\nTherefore, the best initial bid is three 4s. That way, the opponent has to either bid higher (like four of any digit or three of a higher digit) or challenge. But since the total is at least three, challenging would make them lose. So they have to bid higher. \n\nSo the action should be BID: 3 4s.\n"
