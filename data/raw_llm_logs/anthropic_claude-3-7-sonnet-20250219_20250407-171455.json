The current bid is \\'3 9s\\', meaning the opponent claims there are at least 3 nines total between our hands. Since I have 1 nine, that means the opponent would need to have at least 2 nines in their hand for this bid to be valid. While this is possible, I need to consider the bidding history. The opponent has been systematically increasing the digit (0s\u21922s\u21924s\u21929s) while keeping the quantity at 2, until just now when they increased to 3 9s. This systematic pattern suggests they might be bidding strategically rather than based on their actual hand. To make a higher bid, I would need to either bid 4 of any digit or 3 of a digit higher than 9, which isn\\'t possible. Given that I only have 1 nine, and the opponent would need at least 2 nines for their bid to be valid, I think challenging is the better option here.\",\\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\\n}\\n```', type='text')"
