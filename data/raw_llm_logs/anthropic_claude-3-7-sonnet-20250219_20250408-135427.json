        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

The current bid is \\'3 9s\\' made by my opponent. I only have one 9 in my hand, which means there would need to be at least two more 9s in my opponent\\'s hand for the bid to be valid. Given that there are 8 digits in each hand (16 total), and digits are randomly distributed, it\\'s certainly possible my opponent has two or more 9s. However, I don\\'t want to challenge yet as the bid of 3 9s is quite reasonable. Instead, I should make a higher bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s, but I can\\'t bid \\'3 5s\\' as it\\'s not higher than \\'3 9s\\'. I could bid \\'4 0s\\', \\'4 1s\\', etc., but I don\\'t have many of these digits. A safer bid would be \\'4 5s\\' since I already have two 5s, meaning my opponent would need only two more for this to be true. Alternatively, I could bid \\'4 any-digit\\' to increase the quantity, but that\\'s riskier without knowing my opponent\\'s hand.
