The total count of 7s across both hands must be at least 1 (from my hand) + unknown (from Player 0's hand). Since Player 0 bid 2 7s, it implies they likely have at least 1 seven. Thus, the total count of 7s could be 2 or more. I should either challenge if I think it's unlikely or bid higher. Given that I have a relatively high count of 6s (2 sixes), I can bid higher on 6s. The next possible bid exceeding '2 7s' could be '3 6s' or any digit higher than 7. Since I have 2 sixes, I can confidently bid '3 6s'.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 6s\"\n}\n```",
