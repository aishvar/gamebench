You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to make the first bid in this Liar's Poker game. My hand is 88674561. Let me count my digits.\n\nLooking at my hand: 8, 8, 6, 7, 4, 5, 6, 1. So, the counts are:\n\n- 8: 2\n- 6: 2\n- 7: 1\n- 4: 1\n- 5: 1\n- 1: 1\n\nSo the most I have is two 8s and two 6s. Since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total digits in play are 16. The current bid is none, so I need to start with a bid that's reasonable but not too high. \n\nSince I have two 8s, maybe start with a bid that's higher than what I have, considering the opponent might have some. For example, if I bid two 8s, but that's just my own. So maybe bid 3 8s? But since I can start with a lower bid, maybe start with a lower quantity but higher digit. Wait, the first bid can be any quantity and digit as long as it's valid. But since I have two 8s, and two 6s, maybe bid 4 of a lower digit? Wait, no. Wait, the bid has to be on a specific digit. \n\nWait, the rules say the bid must be higher than the current bid, but since there's no current bid, I can start with any bid. So the first bid can be any quantity and digit. But I should choose a bid that's likely to be true based on my hand, but also makes the opponent have to bid higher, possibly leading them to challenge if they can't. \n\nAlternatively, starting with a low bid could be safer. For example, if I have two 8s, maybe bid 3 8s. That way, if the opponent has one or two, the total could be 3 or 4, which would make my bid valid. But if they have none, then the total is 2, which is under. But since I have two, and the opponent has 8 digits, there's a chance they have some. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit, like 6s. I have two 6s. Bidding 3 6s. Same logic. Or maybe start with a lower digit where I have more, but I don't have any digits higher than two. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps bid a digit that I have one of, but in a lower quantity. For example, 2 7s. But I have one 7, so if the opponent has one, that's two. So bidding 2 7s would be safe. But then the opponent can challenge, but if they don't have any, then it's a lie. Hmm. \n\nWait, the goal is to make a bid that's plausible but not easily challenged. Since I have two 8s, bidding 3 8s could be a good start. The opponent has 8 digits, so there's a chance they have one or two 8s. If they have one, total is 3, which meets the bid. If they have two, total is 4. If they have none, then the total is 2, which would make my bid invalid. But since I have two, the chance is higher that they might have at least one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, bid 2 8s. But that's exactly what I have, and the opponent might have more. Wait, but the bid is the total across all players. So if I bid 2 8s, and the opponent has any 8s, then the total is higher. But since the bid is 2, if the opponent has at least one, the total is 3, which is more. So if I bid 2 8s, that's a safe bid because even if the opponent has none, the total is 2 (my two 8s), which meets the bid. Wait, no: if I bid 2 8s, and the total is exactly 2, then the bid is valid. Because the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So 2 8s would be a safe bid because I have two, so the total is at least two. But the opponent might have more. Wait, but the bid is the total across all players. So if I have two, and the opponent has any number (including zero), the total is two plus their count. So if I bid 2 8s, the actual total is 2 + (number of 8s opponent has). Since the opponent's count can be 0-8, the total would be 2 to 10. So my bid of 2 8s is always true, because even if they have zero, the total is 2. Wait, that's right. Because I have two, the minimum total possible is 2, so bidding 2 8s is a guaranteed true bid. But then the next player has to bid higher. So maybe that's a good strategy. But since I can start with any bid, perhaps starting with a higher quantity to force the opponent into a tough spot. \n\nWait, but the first bid must be a valid bid. If I bid 2 8s, which is true, then the next player has to bid higher. They can either bid a higher quantity (like 3 of any digit) or a higher digit with the same quantity (like 2 9s). But 9s are higher than 8s. So if I bid 2 8s, the next player could bid 2 9s, which is higher. But if the opponent has no 9s, that's a risky bid. Alternatively, they might bid 3 of a lower digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start with a higher quantity on a lower digit. For example, if I have two 6s, maybe bid 4 6s. But that's higher than my own count. The opponent has 8 digits, so they might have up to 8 of any digit. But 4 6s would require they have at least two. But if they have two, total is four. But that's a 50% chance (assuming uniform distribution, which it's not). \n\nAlternatively, since I have two 8s and two 6s, maybe bid 3 6s. That way, if the opponent has at least one 6, the total is three or more. But if they have none, then the total is two, which would make my bid false. But I have two, so it's possible. \n\nWait, but as the first bid, I want to make a bid that's as safe as possible. The safest bid would be to bid the exact number I have, because that's guaranteed to be true. For example, if I have two 8s, bid 2 8s. Because even if the opponent has none, the total is two, which meets the bid. But wait, no: the total is across all players. So if I have two, and the opponent has none, the total is two. So the bid of 2 8s is exactly correct, and thus valid. So that's a safe bid. Then the opponent has to bid higher. But if I bid 2 8s, the next player can bid 2 9s, which is higher digit. But if they don't have any 9s, they might challenge. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 3 6s. Since I have two, if the opponent has at least one, the total is three or more. But if they have none, total is two, which is less than three, so my bid is invalid. But as the first bid, perhaps that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps bid 1 of a higher digit. For example, 1 9. Since I have none, but the opponent might have one. But that's a risky bid because if they have none, the total is zero, which is less than 1. So that's a bad bid. \n\nSo the safest first bid would be to bid the exact number of a digit that I have, because that's guaranteed to be true. For example, 2 8s. Because even if the opponent has zero, the total is two. So that's a valid bid. Then the opponent has to bid higher. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 8s, the opponent can challenge, but since the total is at least two, they would lose. So challenging would be bad. So they have to bid higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 8s. Then the opponent has to bid higher. They might bid 3 of something, or a higher digit. If they bid 2 9s, I can challenge if I have no 9s, but I have none in my hand. Wait, my hand is 88674561. So I don't have any 9s. So if the opponent bids 2 9s, I can challenge, knowing that my hand has zero, so the total is their 9s. If they have two, then total is two, which meets their bid. But if they have less than two, then it's invalid. \n\nBut back to my initial bid. Since I'm the first to bid, the safest is to bid 2 8s. That way, the bid is valid regardless of the opponent's hand. But is there a better strategy? Maybe to start with a higher quantity on a lower digit. For example, 4 4s. I have one 4. So if the opponent has three or more 4s, the total is four or more. But if they have two, total is three, which is less. So that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, bid 3 6s. I have two 6s. If the opponent has at least one, total is three or more. If they have none, total is two. So it's a 50-50. But as the first bid, maybe that's too risky. \n\nAlternatively, bid 1 of any digit. But that's too low. The opponent can easily bid higher. \n\nSo the safest first bid is to bid the exact number I have in a digit. So 2 8s or 2 6s. Between those, 8 is a higher digit than 6. So if I bid 2 8s, the next player can either bid higher quantity (like 3 of any digit) or same quantity with a higher digit (like 2 9s). But since 9 is higher than 8, they could do that. But if they have no 9s, they might challenge. But I have no 9s, so if they bid 2 9s, and I challenge, the total would be their 9s. If they have none, then total is zero, so they lose. But if they have one, total is one, which is less than two. So challenging would make me win. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 6s, then the next player can bid 2 7s, 8s, 9s, or higher quantity. But 6 is a lower digit. \n\nHmm. Maybe starting with a higher digit is better because it forces the opponent to bid higher quantities. For example, if I bid 2 8s, then the next player has to bid 3 of any digit or 2 9s. If they bid 2 9s, I can challenge, knowing I have none, and their 9s would need to be two. If they have two, they win. If not, I win. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 6s, the next player can bid 2 7s, which is higher. But I have one 7. So total would be their 7s plus my one. If they have one, total is two, which meets their bid. If they have none, total is one, which is less. So they might bid 2 7s, and I can challenge. \n\nBut as the first bid, perhaps the best is to bid 2 8s, which is safe. Then the opponent has to make a higher bid. So that's a solid opening move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher quantity. For example, 4 5s. I have one 5. So the opponent needs three 5s. If they have three, total is four. But if they have less, the bid is invalid. But that's risky. \n\nSo given that, the safest bid is 2 8s. Because I have two, so the total is at least two. That's a guaranteed valid bid. So I should go with that.\n"
