        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 3 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 24 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

Since the current bid is only 2 9s, it is quite plausible that among the remaining 16 digits (held by two players), there are at least two 9s. Challenging would be risky at this low bid. The minimal safe move is to raise to a higher digit at the same quantity, such as 2 9s to 2 0s, but 0 is lower than 9. So, the only valid minimal raise is increasing the quantity to 3, choosing a digit I have some of. I have two 8s and two 3s. Bidding 3 3s or 3 8s seems reasonable, as with my two known, only one more is needed among 16 digits. I will bid 3 8s, leveraging my two 8s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 8s\"\n}",
