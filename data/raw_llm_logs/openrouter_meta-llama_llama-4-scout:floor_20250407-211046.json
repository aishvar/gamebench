To make a valid higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the maximum possible quantity is 16 and there are 2 players, I can potentially bid higher if I think there are enough digits in my hand and the opponent's hand to make the bid valid. However, without knowing the opponent's hand, I must make an educated guess. The digit '5' appears once in my hand. If I bid '4 5s', it implies there are at least 3 '5s' in total (since 3 were already bid). Given my hand only has 1 '5', I'm inclined to challenge if I think the bid is unlikely to be true or make a conservative bid. But first, let's see if we can make a safe higher bid. A safe bet would be to bid on a digit that is more likely to appear in both hands or bid higher on '5' if we think the opponent might have a '5'. However, bidding higher than '3 5s' with '4 5s' seems risky without more information. A more conservative approach would be to challenge if we think 3 '5s' is unlikely.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
