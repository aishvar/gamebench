        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 3 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '5 4s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 24 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.",

                    "content": "To determine the best course of action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Your Hand**: 10983726\n   - Let's count the digits in your hand: \n     - 1 appears once,\n     - 0 once,\n     - 9 once,\n     - 8 once,\n     - 3 once,\n     - 7 once,\n     - 2 once,\n     - 6 once.\n   - Your hand contains a total of 8 digits with no repeating digits.\n\n2. **Current Bid**: 5 4s\n   - The current bid is made by Player 1, suggesting that there are at least 5 fours across all players' hands.\n\n3. **Bid History**:\n   - The bidding started with 2 8s by Player 0.\n   - Player 1 bid 3 5s, increasing both quantity and digit.\n   - You (Player 2) bid 3 7s, keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit.\n   - Player 0 then bid 4 8s, increasing the quantity.\n   - Player 1 bid 5 4s, increasing the quantity.\n\nGiven that the current bid is 5 4s, to make a higher bid, you need to either bid a higher quantity or keep the quantity the same and bid a higher digit.\n\nLet's analyze your hand: You have one 0, one 1, one 2, one 3, one 6, one 7, one 8, and one 9. Notably, you don't have any 4s. The presence or absence of 4s in your hand doesn't directly influence your decision since you're not bidding on your hand alone, but considering the total count across all hands.\n\nTo make a valid higher bid than 5 4s, you could either bid a higher quantity (e.g., 6 Xs) or the same quantity with a higher digit (e.g., 5 5s).\n\n1. **Bidding a Higher Quantity**: \n   - Bidding 6 4s is a possibility, suggesting there are at least 6 fours. This is a relatively safe bid since it only increases the quantity by 1.\n\n2. **Bidding the Same Quantity with a Higher Digit**:\n   - You could bid 5 5s. This implies there are at least 5 fives across all hands. Given that you have one 3 and no 4s or 5s, and considering the previous bids (especially 3 5s by Player 1 and 3 7s by you), it's plausible that there could be 5 fives.\n\nLet's consider the likelihood and potential outcomes:\n- The total number of digits across all hands is 24 (8 digits per player * 3 players).\n- Bidding 5 5s or 6 4s seems reasonable. However, since you don't have a 4 or 5 in your hand, and the previous bid was 5 4s, bidding 6 4s might be stretching a bit unless you believe the other players have a significant number of 4s.\n\nGiven the information and the need to make a decision:\n- **Reasoning**: The current bid is 5 4s. I can either increase the quantity or keep it the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have a 4 or 5, and given the previous bids, bidding 5 5s seems like a reasonable action. It keeps the quantity the same and increases the digit, which is a valid move according to the rules. It's also somewhat conservative, as it doesn't assume a very high count of a specific digit across all hands.\n\n- **Action**: \"BID: 5 5s\"\n\nHere's the response in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 5 4s. I can either increase the quantity or keep it the same and increase the digit. Since I don't have a 4 or 5, and given the previous bids, bidding 5 5s seems like a reasonable action.
