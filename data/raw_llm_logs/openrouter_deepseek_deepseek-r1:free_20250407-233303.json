You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I'm Player 0, and the current bid is None, so I need to make the first bid. My hand is 20639032. Let me count the digits I have. \n\nLooking at my hand: 2, 0, 6, 3, 9, 0, 3, 2. So, let's tally them up. \n\n0 appears twice, 2 appears twice, 3 appears twice, 6 once, 9 once. So the most frequent digits in my hand are 0, 2, and 3, each with two occurrences. \n\nSince I'm making the first bid, I want to start with a reasonable bid that's not too high but also gives me some flexibility. The total number of digits in the game is 16 (8 per player). But since I don't know the opponent's hand, I have to base my bid on my own.\n\nIf I bid on a digit that I have two of, say 0s, then the total possible could be 2 (mine) plus whatever the opponent has. If I bid 3 0s, that's possible because the opponent might have at least one 0. But since it's the first bid, maybe starting a bit lower. Wait, but the first bid can be any valid quantity and digit. The minimum bid would be 1 of any digit. But to make a strategic bid, I should consider the likelihood of the opponent having some of the same digits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit to make the next player's bid harder. For example, if I bid 2 9s, but I only have one 9. The opponent might have one or none, so that's risky. Alternatively, since I have two 0s, 2s, and 3s, maybe pick the highest digit among those. The highest digit in my hand is 9, but I only have one. So 3 is higher than 2 and 0. So maybe bid 2 3s. But since I have two 3s, the opponent could have one or more. So total could be 2 or more. But the bid is 2 3s. That's a safe starting bid. Alternatively, maybe go for a higher quantity but lower digit. Wait, but the first bid can be anything. Let me think.\n\nWait, the rules say that the first bid must be strictly higher than the current bid, which is None. So any bid is allowed as the first move. So I can start with any quantity and digit. But the strategy is to start with a bid that's likely to be true but also sets the game in a direction that's favorable. \n\nIf I start with a bid of 2 3s, that's based on my two 3s. The opponent might have 0, 1, or more. So the total could be 2, 3, etc. But 2 is a safe starting point. Alternatively, maybe go for a higher digit. For example, 2 9s. But I have one 9. If the opponent has at least one, then total is 2, which meets the bid. But if they have none, then the total is 1, which is under. So that's riskier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 3 of a lower digit. For example, 3 0s. I have two 0s. The opponent needs to have at least one. That's possible. But if they have none, then the total is 2, which is under. So that's a bit risky. \n\nAlternatively, bid 2 6s. I have one 6. The opponent might have one. So total 2. That's possible. But again, depends on their hand. \n\nHmm. Since it's the first bid, maybe start with a moderate bid that's based on the digits I have the most of. The digits I have two of are 0, 2, 3. So maybe pick the highest digit among those, which is 3. So bid 2 3s. That way, if the opponent has at least one 3, the total is 3, which is higher than the bid. But even if they have none, the total is 2, which meets the bid. Wait, no. The bid is 2 3s. If the total is exactly 2, then the bid is correct. So if I bid 2 3s, and the total is 2, then the bid is valid. But since I have two 3s, the opponent could have zero, making the total 2. So that's a safe bid. Because even if the opponent has none, the total is exactly 2, which meets the bid. So that's a safe first move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 3 of a lower digit. For example, 3 0s. But I have two 0s. The opponent needs to have at least one. If they have one, total is 3. If they have none, total is 2. So that's a risk. But maybe the opponent is more likely to have at least one 0. But I can't be sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher quantity but lower digit. For example, 4 2s. I have two 2s. The opponent would need to have two to make it 4. Possible, but not sure. \n\nBut given that the first bid is None, I can choose any. The safest approach is to bid based on the digits I have, ensuring that even if the opponent has none, the bid is still valid. Wait, no. If I bid 2 3s, and the opponent has none, the total is 2, which meets the bid. So that's a valid bid. So that's a safe move. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 1 of a higher digit, like 1 9, but that's not better. \n\nSo the best initial bid would be to pick a digit that I have two of, and bid exactly two. Because even if the opponent has none, the total is two, which meets the bid. Wait, but the bid is for the total across all players. So if I have two, and the opponent has zero, the total is two, which meets the bid. So that's a safe bid. So for example, bid 2 3s. That way, the bid is valid regardless of the opponent's hand. Because I have two, so the total is at least two. Wait, no. Wait, the total is the sum of all players' digits. If I have two 3s, and the opponent has any number, the total is two plus whatever they have. So the total is at least two. So if I bid 2 3s, that's a guaranteed valid bid. Because even if the opponent has zero, the total is two. So that's a sure thing. Therefore, that's a safe opening bid. \n\nBut wait, the opponent could challenge immediately. If I bid 2 3s, and the opponent challenges, then the total is two (if they have none), so I win. So that's a safe bid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid higher. For example, 3 3s. But that would require the opponent to have at least one. If they have none, the total is two, which is less than three, so the challenge would make me lose. So that's risky. \n\nSo the safest first bid is to bid exactly the number of a digit that I have, so that even if the opponent has none, the bid is valid. So in my hand, I have two 0s, two 2s, two 3s. So I can bid 2 0s, 2 2s, or 2 3s. Which one is better? \n\nChoosing the highest digit among them (3) might be better because it makes the next player have to either bid a higher quantity or a higher digit. For example, if I bid 2 3s, the next player can either bid 3 of any digit (like 3 0s) or bid 2 of a higher digit (like 2 4s, 2 5s, etc.). But since higher digits are less likely to have higher quantities, maybe starting with a higher digit makes it harder for the opponent. \n\nAlternatively, starting with a lower digit but higher quantity. But since I can't go higher in quantity without risking, maybe the best is to bid 2 3s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 0s. But 0 is a lower digit, so the next player can bid 2 1s, which is higher. But 0 is a common digit, maybe the opponent has more. \n\nHmm. Let's think about the possible digits. The digits in my hand are 0,2,3,6,9. The opponent's hand could have any digits. But 0 is a common digit, so maybe they have more. If I bid 2 0s, and the opponent has two 0s, the total is four. But if they have none, it's two. Either way, the bid is valid. So that's safe. But if I bid 2 3s, and the opponent has none, it's two. If they have one, it's three. Either way, the bid is valid. \n\nSo either 2 0s, 2 2s, or 2 3s are safe. But which one is strategically better? \n\nBidding on a higher digit might be better because it forces the next player to either increase the quantity or the digit. For example, if I bid 2 3s, the next player can bid 2 4s, 2 5s, etc., which might be harder to achieve. Alternatively, they could bid 3 of a lower digit. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 0s, the next player can bid 2 1s, which is higher digit, but maybe they have more 0s. \n\nBut since I don't know the opponent's hand, maybe the best is to start with the highest possible digit that I have two of, which is 3. So bid 2 3s. That way, the next player has to either bid higher than 2 in quantity or higher than 3 in digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher quantity. For example, 3 0s. But I have two 0s. If the opponent has at least one, then the total is three or more. But if they have none, the total is two, which is less than three, so the bid would be invalid. So that's risky. \n\nSo the safest initial bid is to bid exactly the number of a digit that I have, ensuring that even if the opponent has none, the bid is valid. Therefore, 2 3s is a safe and strategic bid.\n"
