For the bid to be valid, Player 0 would need to have all 3 of the claimed 3s in their 8 digits, which is unlikely because the expected average count of any digit per hand is less than 1. Thus, the probability that Player 0 has 3 or more 3s is quite low. Therefore, it is strategically sound to challenge the bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
