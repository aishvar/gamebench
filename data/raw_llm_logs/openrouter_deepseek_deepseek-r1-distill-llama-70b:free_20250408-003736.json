        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 2s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, my hand is 86033456. Let me break that down: the digits I have are 8, 6, 0, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, looking at this, I have two 6s, two 3s, and one each of 8, 0, 4, and 5.\n\nThe current bid is 3 2s, made by Player 1. The bid history shows that I started by bidding 2 6s, and then Player 1 upped it to 3 2s. Now it's my turn again.\n\nI need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. Let me think about the possible options.\n\nIf I challenge, we'll reveal the total number of 2s. If the total is 3 or more, Player 1 wins, and I lose. If it's less than 3, I win. But I don't have any 2s in my hand, so I know that Player 1 must have all the 2s. Since each player has 8 digits, the maximum number of 2s Player 1 could have is 8, but that's unlikely. However, they only need 3 for their bid. So, it's possible they have 3, but I don't know for sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can make a higher bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the current bid is 3 2s, I can either bid 4 of a digit or 3 of a higher digit.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 6s. So, can I bid 3 6s? Wait, I only have two, so that's not possible unless Player 1 also has at least one 6. But I don't know their hand. Alternatively, I can bid 4 of a digit if I have enough. I have two 3s, so I can't bid 4 3s. I have one 8, 0, 4, 5, so that's not enough. I have two 6s, but that's still not enough for 4.\n\nWait, maybe I can bid a higher digit with the same quantity. The current digit is 2, so any digit higher than 2 with the same quantity of 3 would be acceptable. For example, 3 3s, 3 4s, up to 3 9s.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 3s. So, if I bid 3 3s, that would be higher than 3 2s because 3s are higher than 2s. But I only have two, so I would need Player 1 to have at least one 3 for the total to be 3 or more.\n\nAlternatively, I can bid 3 4s. I have one 4, so I would need Player 1 to have two 4s. That's possible, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother option is to bid 3 5s. I have one 5, so Player 1 would need two 5s. Similarly, 3 6s would require Player 1 to have one more 6 since I have two.\n\nI'm trying to decide which is more likely. If I bid 3 3s, and if Player 1 has at least one 3, then the total would be 3. But if they don't, then I lose. Similarly, for 3 4s, 3 5s, or 3 6s.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider bidding a higher quantity. For example, 4 of a digit. But as I checked earlier, I don't have enough of any digit to make 4. So, I can't do that unless I'm certain that Player 1 has enough.\n\nSo, perhaps the safest bet is to challenge the current bid. Since I don't have any 2s, and if Player 1 has exactly 3, then the bid is valid. But if they have less, I win. However, considering that Player 1 might have 3, it's a bit risky.\n\nAlternatively, making a bid on a higher digit with the same quantity might be better. Let's say I bid 3 3s. If Player 1 has at least one 3, then the total is 3 or more, and my bid is valid. If they don't, then I lose.\n\nBut I don't know their hand, so it's a gamble either way.\n\nAnother angle: considering the previous bid I made was 2 6s, and Player 1 responded with 3 2s. Maybe they are trying to change the digit to something they have more of. So perhaps they do have 3 2s.\n\nBut I don't have any 2s, so if I challenge, I might lose. But if I make a higher bid, I might be able to get away with it if the total meets my bid.\n\nWait, perhaps I can make a bid on a digit I have multiple of. I have two 3s, so maybe I can bid 3 3s. That way, if Player 1 has at least one, we have 3. If not, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 6s, hoping that Player 1 has at least one 6. Since I have two, if they have one, that's three.\n\nBut again, it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 4 of a digit, but I don't have enough.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. I think challenging might be risky because if Player 1 does have 3 2s, I lose. But if I make a bid, I have a chance if the total meets it.\n\nI think I'll go with making a bid on 3 3s. Since I have two, and if Player 1 has one, it's valid. Plus, 3 is higher than 2, so it's a valid higher bid.\n\nSo, my action is to bid 3 3s.\n"
