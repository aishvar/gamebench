You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out whether to bid or challenge here. The current bid is 3 0s from Player 1. My turn now as Player 0. \n\nFirst, check my hand: 94287630. Let me count the zeros. My digits are 9,4,2,8,7,6,3,0. Oh, there's one 0 in my hand. The opponent's hand has 8 digits, so total possible zeros could be up to 8 (if all their digits are 0) plus mine, but that's unlikely. \n\nThe current bid is 3 0s. To call a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity but a higher digit. Since the current digit is 0, any higher digit (like 1-9) would allow me to bid the same quantity but a higher digit. For example, 3 1s would be a valid higher bid. But maybe I can go even higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe increasing the quantity is better. Let's think. If I bid 4 0s, that's higher in quantity. But do I have enough info to support that? My own 0 is 1, so opponent would need at least 3 more. Without knowing their hand, that's possible but risky. If I bid 4 0s, and they challenge, if total is less than 4, I lose. But maybe I can instead switch digits. \n\nAlternatively, since the current bid is 3 0s, I could bid a higher digit with the same quantity. For instance, 3 1s. But I don't have any 1s in my hand. My digits are 9,4,2,8,7,6,3,0. So 1s are zero in my hand. So 3 1s might be risky too. \n\nWait, maybe I can find a digit that I have more of. Let me check my hand again. My digits: 9,4,2,8,7,6,3,0. Are there any digits I have multiple of? Let's see: each digit appears once except maybe... 9 is once, 4 once, etc. Wait, the digits are all unique except for maybe? Wait, the hand is 9,4,2,8,7,6,3,0. All unique. So I have one of each. Hmm. So I can't really bid higher in quantity on any digit I have. Except maybe if I take a chance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid a higher digit with same quantity. The current bid is 3 0s. To raise, I can go to 3 1s, 3 2s, etc., up to 3 9s. Since the current bid's digit is 0, any digit higher than 0 with the same quantity is valid. For example, 3 9s would be better. But do I have any 9s? Yes, I have one 9. So if I bid 3 9s, that requires that there are at least 3 9s in total. My hand has one, so opponent must have at least two. That's possible but maybe risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for a higher quantity. Let's see. The current bid is 3 0s. To bid higher, I can go to 4 of any digit. But which digit? Let's see. Let's pick a digit that I have. Let's see, I have a 9. If I bid 4 9s, but I only have one. That's a big risk. Alternatively, maybe a digit that's lower but possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent's bid of 3 0s is already high. Since there are 16 total digits. The maximum possible zeros in both hands is up to 8 (if opponent has all zeros). So 3 zeros is possible. But maybe challenging is better. Wait, the current bid is 3 0s. The total zeros could be as low as 1 (mine) plus whatever opponent has. If opponent has none, then total is 1, which is less than 3. But if they have two, that's 3. So the bid is exactly 3 would be possible if they have two. But if they have one, then total is 2, which is under. \n\nHmm, so challenging might be a good option here. Because if I challenge, and the total zeros are less than 3, I win. But there's a chance they have two zeros. Let's see, the opponent's bid is 3 0s. They might have some zeros. Suppose they have two, making total 3. Then challenging would lose. But if they have one or none, then challenging would win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid a higher digit. For example, 3 9s. My hand has one 9. The opponent might have none, so total would be 1, which is less than 3. So if I bid 3 9s, and they challenge, I would lose. That's bad. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid a lower digit but higher quantity. Like 4 0s. But again, my zeros are only one, so opponent needs three. If they have three, then total is 4. But maybe that's possible? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to challenge. Because the bid is 3 0s, and my own count is 1. So unless opponent has two or more zeros, the bid is wrong. The opponent's bid is 3 0s. They might have two, but maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the opponent is trying to bluff. Since they raised from 2 0s to 3 0s. Maybe they don't have many. \n\nHmm. Let's think of probabilities. The opponent has 8 digits. The chance that they have at least two 0s? The probability depends on how the hands are dealt. Assuming uniform distribution, the expected number of zeros in their hand is 0.8 (since each digit has 1/10 chance, 8 digits). The probability that they have exactly two zeros is C(8,2)*(0.1)^2*(0.9)^6 \u2248 around 28 * 0.01 * 0.53 \u2248 ~1.5%. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, the probability of exactly k zeros in their hand is C(8,k)*(0.1)^k*(0.9)^{8\u2212k}. \n\nCalculating for k=2: C(8,2)=28, so 28*(0.1)^2*(0.9)^6 \u2248 28 *0.01 *0.531441 \u2248 ~0.149. So ~14.9% chance of exactly two zeros. \n\nFor k=3: C(8,3)=56, so 56*(0.001)*(0.531441) \u2248 ~0.0295, ~2.95% \n\nAdding up, the chance they have two or three zeros is about 17.8%. So total zeros (mine plus theirs) would be 1+2=3 or 1+3=4. \n\nSo if their hand has two zeros, total is 3, so the bid is valid. If they have three, then bid is okay. But if they have one, total is 2, so challenge would win. \n\nThe probability that the bid is wrong is the probability that they have 0,1, or maybe even 0. \n\nThe chance opponent has 0 zeros: (0.9)^8 \u2248 0.4305, so ~43% \n\n1 zero: C(8,1)*0.1*(0.9)^7 \u2248 8*0.1*0.478 \u2248 ~38.2% \n\nSo total chance that opponent has 0 or 1 zeros is ~43+38.2=81.2%. So challenging would win in 81% of cases. That's a good chance. \n\nTherefore, challenging might be the better move here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is likely to have some zeros, but given the bid of 3, maybe they have two. \n\nHmm, but the bid is 3 0s. If they have two, then they might be assuming that I have one (which I do), so total is 3. So they might be telling the truth. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should challenge, since the probability is high that they are bluffing. \n\nSo my reasoning is that the current bid of 3 0s requires at least three zeros in total. I have one, so opponent needs two. The chance that opponent has two or more zeros is around 18.8% (2+3+...). Wait, no: the chance they have two or more is 1 - (prob 0 or 1). So 1 - 81.2% = 18.8%. So there's a 18.8% chance the bid is valid. \n\nTherefore, challenging has a 81.2% chance to win. That's a good bet. So I should challenge.\n"
