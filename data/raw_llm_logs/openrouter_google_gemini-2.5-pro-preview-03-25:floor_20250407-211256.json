My hand contains zero 5s. For the current bid of '2 5s' to be true, Player 0 must hold at least two 5s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, challenging such a low opening bid is risky. It's generally better to increase the bid. \\n\\nAnalyzing my hand, I have:\\n- two 1s\\n- one 2\\n- one 4\\n- one 6\\n- one 7\\n- one 8\\n- one 9\\n\\nA higher bid must increase the quantity (to 3 or more) or keep the quantity at 2 but increase the digit (to 6, 7, 8, or 9).\\n\\nPossible safe bids based on my hand:\\n- '2 6s' (I have one 6, need one more from opponent)\\n- '2 7s' (I have one 7, need one more from opponent)\\n- '2 8s' (I have one 8, need one more from opponent)\\n- '2 9s' (I have one 9, need one more from opponent)\\n- '3 1s' (I have two 1s, need one more from opponent)\\n\\nBidding '3 1s' seems strategically strong. It leverages my strongest digit count (two 1s), making the bid highly likely to be true (opponent only needs one 1 out of 8 digits). It also increases the quantity, putting more pressure on the opponent than bids like '2 6s' or '2 9s'. Therefore, I will bid '3 1s'.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 1s\"\n}\n```",
