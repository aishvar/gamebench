        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 3s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

This means all 4 claimed 3s would need to be in Player 0\\'s hand. While this is possible, it would require Player 0 to have half their hand as 3s, which seems unlikely. They might be bluffing. However, I should consider my options for bidding higher. I could bid \\'4 4s\\' (I have one 4), \\'4 5s\\' (I have one 5), \\'4 7s\\' (I have one 7), \\'4 8s\\' (I have one 8), \\'4 9s\\' (I have two 9s), or increase the quantity to 5 with any digit. Since I have two 9s in my hand, bidding \\'5 9s\\' would mean Player 0 needs to have three more 9s, which is unlikely but possible. I think challenging the \\'4 3s\\' bid is my best move since I have zero 3s and it would require Player 0 to have exactly 4 threes.\", \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"}', type='text')"
