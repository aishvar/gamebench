The current bid is 3 zeros. My hand is 15625862, which contains 2 zeros. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and there are only 2 players, the total count of zeros across both hands could be at most 4 (if the other player also has 2 zeros). Since I have 2 zeros, I will calculate the possibility of having a higher bid. If I bid '3 1s', I must believe there are at least 3 ones in total across both hands. My hand contains 1 one. Without knowing Player 0's hand, if I assume they could have up to 8 ones (which is highly unlikely but possible), the total could be 9 ones at most. However, bidding '3 1s' seems risky without more information. A safer approach would be to bid on a digit that I know exists in my hand and could potentially have a high count. I see I have 2 fives, and there's no information about fives yet. Thus, bidding '4 5s' seems like a reasonable move as it exceeds the current bid quantity and targets a digit I have in abundance.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: Q D\"\n}\n```",
