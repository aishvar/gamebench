You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. My hand is 26569238. So I need to figure out how many 4s there are in total. I have zero 4s in my hand. The current bid is 3 4s from Player 1. Since each player has 8 digits, the total possible digits in the game are 16. \n\nPlayer 1 bid 3 4s after I bid 2 6s. Now, I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. Since I have no 4s, the opponent must have at least 3 4s in their hand for the bid to be valid. But how likely is that? Let's think. The opponent has 8 digits. The chance that they have three or more 4s is possible, but 4s are just one digit. The probability might not be very high. \n\nIf I challenge and they have exactly 3 4s, then I lose. But if they have fewer than 3, I win. Since I have none, they need to have all 3. Let's consider the possible scenarios. If the opponent has 3 or more 4s, their bid is valid. But given that there are 8 digits in their hand, getting three of the same digit is possible but not super common. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid higher. The current bid is 3 4s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity to 4 (with any digit) or keep the quantity at 3 and choose a higher digit than 4. For example, 3 5s, 3 6s, etc. Let's check my hand again. My hand has two 6s, two 9s, two 2s, a 5, and an 8. So I have two 6s. If I bid 3 6s, that's higher than 3 4s. But the total number of 6s in the game would be my two plus whatever the opponent has. If I bid 3 6s, the opponent would need to have at least one 6 for the bid to be valid. But if they have none, then the total is 2, which is less than 3. So that's risky. Alternatively, I could bid 4 of a higher digit. For example, 4 2s. But I have two 2s. So opponent would need to have two 2s. But that's possible. But maybe that's also a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 3 5s. I have one 5. So opponent would need two 5s. That's possible. But again, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe challenge. Since I have zero 4s, the opponent needs to have at least three. If they have three, then the total is three, which meets the bid. But if they have two or fewer, the bid is invalid. So the question is, is it more likely that the opponent has three 4s? Considering that in their 8-card hand, having three of a single digit is possible, but not extremely common. Since there are 10 possible digits, the probability of having three 4s is not that high. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are bluffing. Since they raised from my 2 6s to 3 4s, perhaps they don't have many 4s but are trying to push the bid higher. \n\nIf I challenge and they have three or more 4s, I lose. If I bid higher, I might be able to push the bid to a point where they have to challenge. But what's the best move here. \n\nGiven that I have no 4s, and the opponent's bid is 3 4s, the chance that they have three 4s is not certain. It's a gamble. But maybe challenging is the better option here. Because if they have three, I lose, but if they have less, I win. Considering that the opponent might have a weaker hand, challenging could be the right move. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 3 5s, which is higher than 3 4s, then the opponent can challenge that. If they challenge, and the total 5s are my one plus theirs. If they have one or more, then total is two or more, which is less than 3. So that would make me lose. So that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, bid 4 2s. I have two 2s. So opponent needs two 2s. Possible, but again, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, bid 3 6s. I have two 6s. Opponent needs at least one. If they have one, total is three. So that's valid. If they have none, then total is two, which is less. So again, risky. \n\nHmm. Maybe challenging is the better option here. Because the opponent's bid is 3 4s, and I have none. So unless they have three, which is possible but not guaranteed, challenging could be the way to go. It's a bit of a gamble, but given that the opponent might be bluffing, it's worth challenging.\n"
