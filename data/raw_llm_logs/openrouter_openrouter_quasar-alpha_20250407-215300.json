Looking at my hand (87302066), I have zero '1's, which means the entire bid depends on the opponent having at least two '1's. Given that each player has 8 digits, the average count of any specific digit is around 1.6, but since I have none, it's less likely the opponent has two or more. Therefore, the bid of 2 '1's is somewhat risky for Player 0, making a challenge favorable. Additionally, I have three '0's in my hand, and since I previously bid 2 '0's, a higher zero bid (like 3 0s) is plausible. This would be a safer incremental bid compared to raising the '1's count. Thus, the best move is to bid 3 zeros.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 0\"\n}",
