        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 3 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 2s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 24 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

The current bid is 2 2s, which means at least two 2s across all 24 digits. Since I have zero 2s, the remaining 16 digits (held by Players 0 and 2) would need to contain at least two 2s to make the bid valid, which is plausible. Therefore, challenging now is risky. The minimal raise is to bid 2 3s, but I have zero 3s as well. However, I do have two 8s and two 0s, so a safe and strategic higher bid would be '2 8s' or '2 9s' (I have one 9). Since '2 2s' is the current bid, I can outbid it by bidding '2 3s' or any higher digit at quantity 2, but it's safer to increase the quantity to 3 based on my hand. I have two 8s, so bidding '3 8s' is reasonable, assuming at least one more 8 among the other players.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 8s\"\n}",
