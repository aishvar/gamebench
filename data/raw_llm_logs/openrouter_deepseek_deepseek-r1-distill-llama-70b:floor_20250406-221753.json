You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at my hand. I have the digits 6, 8, 9, 4, 3, 3, 4, 7. So, breaking that down, I have one 6, one 8, one 9, two 4s, two 3s, and one 7. That's a total of eight digits, as expected.\n\nThe current bid is 2 9s, made by Player 1. The bid history shows that I started by bidding 1 9s, and then Player 1 raised it to 2 9s. Now it's my turn again.\n\nI need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. To challenge, I have to think about whether there are at least two 9s between both players. If I challenge and the total is less than two, I win; otherwise, Player 1 wins.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have one 9. So, if I have one, Player 1 could have another, making the total exactly two. But could there be more? Well, each player has eight digits, so the maximum number of 9s possible is 16, but that's extremely unlikely. However, in this case, the bid is only 2, so it's more about whether there's exactly two or more.\n\nI should consider the probabilities. Since I have one 9, the chance that Player 1 has at least one more is possible, but not certain. But given that the bid is low (only 2), it's actually quite plausible. If I challenge, there's a 50% chance I might be wrong, but maybe I can get away with it. Alternatively, maybe I can make a higher bid based on my hand.\n\nLooking at my digits, I have two 4s, two 3s, and one each of 6, 7, 8, 9. So, I have pairs in 4s and 3s. The current bid is on 9s, so if I want to bid higher, I could either increase the quantity or choose a higher digit.\n\nIf I choose to bid on 4s, I have two, so I could bid 2 4s. But wait, the current bid is 2 9s. To make a higher bid, I can either bid a higher quantity on the same digit or the same quantity on a higher digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, I can't go higher on the digit. So, I would need to increase the quantity. But if I bid 3 9s, that might be risky because I only have one 9, and Player 1 might have one or two. If I bid 3, and the total is two, I lose. So that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, I could switch to a different digit. For example, I have two 4s. So I could bid 2 4s. But wait, 4 is lower than 9, so the bid must be strictly higher. The rules say that a higher bid can be either higher quantity or same quantity but higher digit. So, since 4 is lower than 9, bidding 2 4s wouldn't be higher than 2 9s. Therefore, I can't do that.\n\nWhat about other digits? I have two 3s. Bidding 2 3s is also lower than 2 9s, so that's not possible. I have one 6, 7, 8. So, maybe I can bid 1 8s, but that's lower in quantity than 2, so it's not higher. Alternatively, I could bid 2 8s if I think there are at least two between us.\n\nWait, I have one 8. If I bid 2 8s, I need to consider if Player 1 has at least one more. That's possible, but not certain. It might be a safer bet than challenging the 9s.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 of a lower digit. For example, I have two 4s, so maybe I can bid 3 4s. But I only have two, so unless Player 1 has at least one, the total would be three. But I don't know their hand, so it's a risk.\n\nHmm, challenging might be the better option here. Since the current bid is 2 9s, and I have one, if Player 1 has one, the total is two, which meets the bid. But if Player 1 has zero, then the total is one, and I win. However, if Player 1 has two, the total is three, and I lose. So, it's a bit of a gamble. But considering that the initial bid was 1 9s, and Player 1 raised it to 2, perhaps they have at least one 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can make a bid on another digit where I have more confidence. For example, I have two 4s. If I bid 2 4s, but as I thought earlier, that's not a higher bid than 2 9s. So, I can't do that. I need to either increase the quantity or choose a higher digit.\n\nWait, since 9 is the highest digit, I can't choose a higher digit. So, the only way to make a higher bid is to increase the quantity on 9s. So, I could bid 3 9s. But I only have one, so I'm relying on Player 1 having two. That's risky because if they have only one, the total is two, and my bid of three would fail.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a different digit with a higher quantity. For example, if I have two 4s, maybe I can bid 3 4s, hoping that Player 1 has at least one. But again, that's uncertain.\n\nGiven all this, perhaps challenging is safer. If I challenge and the total is exactly two, I lose. If it's one, I win. The risk is that if the total is three or more, I lose. But considering that the initial bid was 1, and Player 1 raised it to 2, they might have one, making the total two. So, challenging might result in me losing. Therefore, maybe it's better to make a bid on another digit where I have more control.\n\nWait, another approach: since I have two 3s, maybe I can bid 2 3s. But as I thought earlier, that's not a higher bid than 2 9s. So, not possible.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 8s, since I have one 8. If Player 1 has one, the total is two, which would make my bid valid. But if they have none, I lose. It's a bit risky, but maybe better than challenging.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 7s, but I only have one 7. Same issue.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the maximum possible. Since each player has eight digits, the total number of any digit can't exceed 16. But that's not very helpful here.\n\nAnother angle: the initial bid was 1 9s by me, then Player 1 raised to 2. So, they're confident enough to raise. Maybe they have two 9s, making the total three. Or perhaps they have one, making it two.\n\nGiven that, if I challenge, there's a chance I might lose if the total is two or three. But if I bid 3 9s, I might be overbidding if the total is two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can bid on another digit where I have more. For example, I have two 4s. If I bid 3 4s, hoping that Player 1 has at least one, making the total three. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 8s, as I have one, hoping Player 1 has one. That's a 50% chance, but maybe better than challenging.\n\nWait, but the current bid is 2 9s. If I bid 2 8s, is that a higher bid? No, because 8 is lower than 9. So, I can't do that. I have to either increase the quantity or choose a higher digit. Since 9 is the highest, I can't choose a higher digit. So, the only option is to increase the quantity on 9s.\n\nSo, I have to decide between bidding 3 9s or challenging.\n\nIf I bid 3 9s and the total is two, I lose. If it's three, I win. If it's four or more, I still win. But the chance that the total is exactly two is possible, especially since I have one and Player 1 might have one.\n\nAlternatively, challenging would mean that if the total is two, I lose, but if it's one, I win.\n\nSo, it's a bit of a toss-up. But considering that Player 1 raised the bid from 1 to 2, they might have at least one 9, making the total two. Therefore, challenging might result in me losing. On the other hand, if I bid 3 9s, and the total is two, I lose, but if it's three or more, I win.\n\nGiven that, maybe bidding 3 9s is better because if the total is exactly two, I lose, but if it's three or more, I win. However, if I challenge and the total is two, I lose, but if it's one, I win. So, both options have risks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider other digits. Wait, I have two 3s. If I bid 2 3s, but that's not higher than 2 9s. So, no.\n\nAlternatively, I have two 4s. If I bid 2 4s, same issue.\n\nWait, perhaps I can bid 4 of a lower digit. For example, I have two 4s, so maybe I can bid 3 4s, hoping Player 1 has at least one. But again, that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 8s, but as I thought earlier, that's not higher than 2 9s.\n\nSo, perhaps the best move is to challenge. If I challenge and the total is two, I lose. If it's one, I win. Given that Player 1 raised the bid, they might have at least one, making the total two. So, challenging might not be the best move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should bid 3 9s. If I do that, and the total is three or more, I win. If it's two, I lose. But considering that I have one, and Player 1 might have one, making it two, I might lose. So, it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can bid on a different digit where I have more. Wait, I have two 3s and two 4s. Maybe I can bid 3 4s, hoping that Player 1 has at least one. But that's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 8s, but that's not higher than 2 9s.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. I think the safest move is to challenge, hoping that the total is one. But given that Player 1 raised the bid, they might have at least one, making the total two. So, challenging might not be safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 9s, taking the risk that the total is three or more. If I have one, and Player 1 has two, the total is three, and I win. If Player 1 has only one, the total is two, and I lose.\n\nI think I'll go with challenging because if the total is exactly two, I lose, but if it's one, I win. Considering that Player 1 raised the bid, they might have one, making it two, so I might lose. But perhaps they don't have any, making the total one, and I win. It's a 50-50 chance, but maybe better than overbidding.\n\nWait, no, if I challenge and the total is two, I lose. If it's one, I win. So, it's a gamble. Alternatively, if I bid 3 9s, and the total is two, I lose, but if it's three or more, I win. So, both options have risks.\n\nI think I'll go with challenging. Maybe Player 1 doesn't have any 9s, making the total one, and I win. It's a risk, but perhaps worth it.\n"
