You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. The game is just starting, so there are no previous bids. My hand is 9, 4, 0, 9, 7, 7, 1, 0. First, I need to analyze my hand to see which digits I have and their frequencies.\n\nLooking at my digits: 0 appears twice, 7 appears twice, and 9 appears twice. The rest are single digits: 4 and 1. So, the highest quantity I have for any digit is two. \n\nSince the current bid is None, I can start by bidding on any digit. My goal is to choose a bid that's both safe and gives me a strategic advantage. Bidding on a digit I have multiple of might be a good start because it's more likely to be accurate, reducing the risk of being challenged.\n\nI have two 0s, two 7s, and two 9s. Between these, 9 is the highest digit. Bidding on a higher digit can give me an edge because if someone else has to bid higher, they might have to either increase the quantity or the digit, which could be challenging. \n\nSo, I could bid 2 9s. This is a reasonable starting point because it's based on my actual count, and it's a solid foundation. Alternatively, I could also consider 2 7s or 2 0s, but 9 is the highest, so it's better to start with that.\n\nI don't want to overbid because that could make my bid too high and risky. Starting with a lower quantity but a higher digit seems safer. Plus, it forces the opponent to either challenge or bid higher, which might put them in a tougher spot.\n\nAnother consideration is the total number of digits in play. There are 16 digits in total (8 each). If I bid 2 9s, the opponent might have 0, 1, or 2 9s. If they have none, the total would be 2, which matches my bid. If they have one, the total is 3, which is still higher than my bid. So, my bid is safe in that scenario.\n\nIf I bid 2 9s and the opponent challenges, I'm confident because I have two 9s. If the opponent doesn't challenge, they have to bid higher, which could lead them to make a risky move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider bidding a higher quantity, like 3 of a lower digit, but since I only have two of any digit, that might be risky. It's better to stick with what I have to avoid potential challenges.\n\nSo, after evaluating, the best move is to bid 2 9s. It's a safe and strategic start to the game.\n"
