        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Let me analyze the digits I have here.\n\nBreaking down my digits: 8, 4, 1, 3, 6, 1, 7, 3. So, I have two 1s, two 3s, one 4, one 6, one 7, and one 8. Since I'm starting, I need to choose a digit to bid on. The goal is to make a bid that's likely higher than what others might have but not so high that it's easily challengeable.\n\nLooking at the digits, 1 appears twice in my hand. That's more than any other digit except for 3, which also appears twice. Maybe I can bid on 1s. If I bid 2 1s, that's a safe starting point. It's low enough that others might think they can go higher, but if they challenge, I have the support of my two 1s.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on another digit like 3s, but since both 1s and 3s are in my hand twice, either could work. Maybe starting with 1s is better because lower digits might be less expected, making it a bit trickier for opponents.\n\nWait, but since I'm the first to bid, I can set the tone. Bidding 2 1s seems reasonable. It's a low bid, but it's based on my actual hand. If the other player doesn't have many 1s, they might challenge, but if they do, they might raise the bid. Either way, starting with 2 1s gives me a solid foundation.\n"
