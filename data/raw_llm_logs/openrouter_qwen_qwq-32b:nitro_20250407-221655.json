You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out my best move in this Liar's Poker game. Let's start by looking at the current situation. The user's hand is 48071056. That's eight digits: 4, 8, 0, 7, 1, 0, 5, 6. Let me count how many of each digit I have here.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the digits in my hand: 4, 8, 0, 7, 1, 0, 5, 6. \n\nLooking for duplicates:\n- 0 appears twice (positions 3 and 6)\n- The other digits (4,8,7,1,5,6) each appear once. \n\nSo the counts in my hand are:\n- 0: 2\n- 1:1\n-4:1\n-5:1\n-6:1\n-7:1\n-8:1\n\nThe current bid is None, which means I need to make the first bid. Since there's no previous bid, my bid just has to be a valid starting bid. The rules say a bid must be strictly higher than the current bid, but since it's None, I can choose any quantity and digit. However, I should choose something that's plausible but also sets up a good position.\n\nThe total digits in play are 16 (since each player has 8). The bid has to be about the total count of a specific digit across both hands. Since I have two 0s, maybe bidding on 0s would be a good start. But I need to consider what's a reasonable bid. If I have two 0s, maybe the opponent has some as well. Let's see: the maximum possible for any digit is 16, but realistically, with two players, the counts can vary.\n\nIf I bid \"2 0s\", that's the minimum, but since I have two already, it's safe but not strategic. But since I'm starting, maybe I should go higher to set a higher bar. Alternatively, maybe bid on a digit I have more of, but I only have two 0s. Other digits in my hand are only one each. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid on a higher digit, like 3 1s. But I only have one 1. That might be risky. Alternatively, 3 0s. Since I have two, maybe the opponent has one? Then total would be 3. But if I bid 3 0s, I'm saying there are at least three. That's possible, but maybe too confident. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower bid on a digit I have, to encourage others to raise. Wait, but the first bid can be anything. The key is to choose a bid that's hard for the opponent to beat but not impossible for me to defend if challenged. Alternatively, maybe start with a bid that's slightly higher than my count, hoping the opponent doesn't have that digit much. \n\nWait, the first bid can be any quantity and digit. Let me think of the best opening bid. Maybe starting with 3 of a digit I have. Since I have two 0s, bidding 3 0s would mean there's at least three in total. The opponent could have one, making it possible. Alternatively, if I bid 2 8s, since I have one 8, maybe the opponent has one, making it two. But starting with a bid of 2 8s is low, and the next player could easily raise it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit but lower quantity. Like 2 9s. Since I don't have any 9s, but the opponent might have none either. But that's risky because if I bid 2 9s, and the opponent has none, then challenging would win, but if they have one, then the total is 1, which is less than 2. Hmm, but I don't know their hand. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting with 3 5s. I have one 5. If the opponent has two, that's three. But maybe that's too much. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 2 7s. I have one, so opponent could have one. \n\nAlternatively, since I have two 0s, maybe start with 3 0s. That way, if the opponent has at least one 0, then the total is 3. But if they don't, then it's just 2. But if I bid 3 0s, and they challenge, I lose unless there's a third. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit but lower count. Like 2 8s. Since I have one, opponent might have one. \n\nWait, but the first bid can be anything. Maybe the standard opening is to bid something like 3 of the lower digit. Let me think of common strategies. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal first move is to bid 3 of the lowest digit you have. Since I have two 0s, maybe 3 0s. That way, since I have two, the opponent just needs to have one to make it valid. But if they don't, then challenging would win, but I might be taking a risk. Alternatively, maybe start with 2 0s. But that's the minimum, and the next player can easily raise it to 3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. Like 2 8s. Since 8 is a higher digit, so even if the quantity is same, higher digit is better. Wait, the rules say a bid can be higher quantity, or same quantity but higher digit. So if I bid 2 8s, the next player could bid 2 9s, which is higher digit. \n\nHmm, perhaps starting with a higher digit but lower quantity is better. Because then others have to either raise the quantity or go higher in digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a bid that's slightly above my own count but plausible. Since I have two 0s, maybe bid 3 0s. Let's see: the total possible 0s could be up to 8 (if both have all 0s, but that's unlikely). But realistically, opponent might have 0-6 more. If I bid 3, that's achievable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 7s. Since I have one 7, opponent could have one, making two. But that's a low bid. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best first bid is 3 of the lowest digit you have. Since 0 is the lowest, bid 3 0s. That seems reasonable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that starting with a higher digit (like 8) but lower quantity. Like 2 8s. Since 8 is higher than 0, so even if the quantity is same, it's a better bid. But since the current bid is None, I can choose any. \n\nWait, but the first move can be anything. Let me think again. Since I have two 0s, maybe bidding 3 0s is a good start. That way, if the opponent doesn't have any 0s, then challenging would win, but if they do, then maybe they can raise it. Alternatively, maybe start with a higher digit but lower quantity. Like 2 8s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 3 of a digit I don't have. But that's risky. \n\nHmm, perhaps the best opening is to bid 3 0s. That uses my two 0s and gives a plausible total. Alternatively, maybe 2 0s is too low, but I need to start somewhere. \n\nAlternatively, since the bid can be any, maybe I can start with a higher bid like 4 0s. But that might be too much. I have two, so opponent would need two more. Maybe possible but risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 3 1s. I have one 1, so total could be up to 9 (if opponent has two 1s). But I have only one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a middle digit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best is to bid 3 0s, given that I have two. Let's go with that. \n\nSo my action would be BID: 3 0s. \n\nThe reasoning is that I have two 0s in my hand. Bidding 3 0s is a reasonable opening bid since there's a chance the opponent has at least one 0, making the total count 3 or more. Starting with a lower quantity but on a low digit allows me to set a baseline that others might have to increase the quantity or choose a higher digit."
