        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, my hand is 02180757. Let me list out the digits I have: 0, 2, 1, 8, 0, 7, 5, 7. So, I have two 0s, one 1, one 2, one 5, two 7s, and one 8. That's my hand. \n\nSince the current bid is None, I have to make the first bid. I need to decide whether to bid on a digit and a quantity. The goal is to make a bid that's likely to be correct but also sets the stage for the game. \n\nLooking at my digits, I have two 0s, two 7s, and single instances of 1, 2, 5, and 8. Since I have two of 0 and 7, maybe I can bid on one of those. But I don't know what the other player has, so I have to be cautious.\n\nBidding on 0s: I have two, so if I bid 2 0s, it's possible the opponent might have more, but 0s are common in some cases. Alternatively, 7s: I have two, but 7s might be less common. \n\nWait, but since it's the first bid, maybe I should start low to not overcommit. Bidding 2 of a digit I have seems safe. Let me think about which digit is less likely to be challenged. \n\nIf I bid on 0s, maybe the opponent has none, but 0s can be common. If I bid on 7s, it's possible the opponent doesn't have many. Alternatively, I could bid on a digit I have only one of, but that's riskier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should bid on a digit I have two of, to have a higher chance of the total being at least that. So, 2 0s or 2 7s. \n\nBut wait, if I bid 2 0s, the opponent might have more, making the total higher. But if I bid 2 7s, maybe the opponent has none or one, making the total 2 or 3. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 of a digit I have one of, but that's a stretch. Since I have two of 0 and 7, maybe I should stick with that.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I should bid on the highest digit I have to maximize the bid's strength. My highest digit is 8, but I only have one. So, bidding 1 8s is possible, but it's a low quantity. Maybe not the best.\n\nAlternatively, I have two 7s, so bidding 2 7s. That seems reasonable. Or two 0s. \n\nI think 2 7s is a good starting point. It's a moderate digit, not too high, and I have two of them. The opponent might not expect it, and it's a safe bet. Plus, if they challenge, and I only have two, but maybe they have none, so the total would be two, meeting the bid. If they have one, total is three, which is still good. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 0s, and the opponent has two 0s as well, the total would be four, which is higher than my bid, so I might lose if challenged. But 0s are more common, so maybe the opponent has more. \n\nHmm, maybe 2 7s is safer because 7s are less likely to be in the opponent's hand in large numbers. So, I'll go with BID: 2 7s. That way, I have a good chance of the bid being correct, and it's a solid starting move.\n"
