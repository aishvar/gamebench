You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out my move in this Liar's Poker game. Let's start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, the game is between two players, each with 8 secret digits. My hand is 36971468. I need to make a bid or challenge, but since the current bid is 'None', I have to make the first bid. \n\nLooking at my hand, I should count how many of each digit I have. Let's list them out: 3, 6, 9, 7, 1, 4, 6, 8. So, the digits are 3, 6, 9, 7, 1, 4, 6, 8. \n\nCounting each digit:\n- 1: 1\n- 3: 1\n- 4: 1\n- 6: 2\n- 7: 1\n- 8: 1\n- 9: 1\n\nSo, I have two 6s and one each of the others. Since each player has 8 digits, the total number of any digit across both hands can't exceed 16. \n\nNow, since it's the first bid, I can choose any digit and any quantity. My goal is to make a bid that's believable but also gives me a strategic advantage. \n\nI have two 6s, so if I bid on 6s, I can potentially set a foundation. Maybe I can bid 2 6s. That seems safe because I know I have two, and the opponent might have zero or more. But is that the best move? \n\nAlternatively, I could bid a higher quantity on a digit I have only one of, but that might be riskier. For example, bidding 3 9s would be a stretch because I only have one, and the opponent might not have two. \n\nWait, but since the bid is about the total across both hands, maybe I should consider what's likely. If I bid 2 6s, it's a low bid, but it's safe. The opponent might then try to bid higher, perhaps on a different digit or the same with a higher quantity. \n\nOn the other hand, if I bid higher than what I have, like 3 6s, that's possible if the opponent has at least one 6. But I don't know their hand. It's a bit risky because if they challenge, and the total is only two, I lose. \n\nSince it's the first bid, maybe starting with 2 6s is a good opening. It's a modest bid, shows I have some confidence, and gives me room to maneuver in the next turns. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I have only one of but is high, like 9. Bidding 1 9s is too low, but maybe 2 9s. But I only have one, so unless the opponent has another, it won't hold. \n\nI think the safest bet is to bid 2 6s. It's based on my hand, and it's a solid starting point without overextending. \n\nSo, my action would be to bid 2 6s.\n"
