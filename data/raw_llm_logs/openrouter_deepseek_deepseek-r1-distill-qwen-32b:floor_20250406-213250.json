        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let's see, I have the hand 87534713. That's eight digits. The current bid is 4 6s, made by Player 1. The previous bid was 3 7s from me. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules. Each player has 8 digits, so together there are 16 digits in total. Bids are about the total count of a specific digit across both hands. My goal is to either make a higher bid or challenge if I think the current bid is too high.\n\nLooking at my hand, I don't have any 6s. Player 1's bid is 4 6s, which means they think there are at least four 6s in total. Since I don't have any, Player 1 must have all four 6s in their hand. But wait, each player only has 8 digits. If Player 1 has four 6s, that leaves room for other digits. \n\nI should consider the likelihood of Player 1 having four 6s. It's possible, but maybe not very likely. If I challenge, I'm risking losing if they do have four 6s. Alternatively, I could bid higher. The next possible bid would be either a higher quantity or a higher digit with the same quantity.\n\nSince the current bid is 4 6s, a higher bid could be 5 6s or 4 7s. But I don't have any 7s either, so 4 7s might not be a good move because I can't be certain about it. Bidding 5 6s would require me to think Player 1 has four and I have one, but I don't have any. So that's not a good idea either.\n\nAnother option is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. So, from 4 6s, the next would be 4 7s. But again, I don't have any 7s, so I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, I could bid a higher digit with a higher quantity, like 5 7s, but that seems risky too.\n\nWait, maybe challenging is the better option here. Since I don't have any 6s, and Player 1 is claiming four, I'm thinking that's a high number. If I challenge and win, I gain an advantage. But if I lose, I have to pay the consequences. \n\nI should also consider the previous bid. I had bid 3 7s, and Player 1 went higher to 4 6s. That might indicate that they have some confidence in having multiple 6s. But without knowing their hand, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nAnother angle: the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, but realistically, with only two players, it's 8 each. So four 6s is half of Player 1's hand. It's possible, but maybe not the most probable.\n\nGiven all this, I think challenging is the better move. I don't have any 6s, so if Player 1 is wrong, I win. If they're right, I lose. But considering the bid is 4, which is a significant number, I'm inclined to challenge.\n"
