Since I only see one 7, for the opponent's bid of 2 sevens to be true, they must have at least one 7 in their hand. This is plausible, as it's common to have at least a couple of any digit across 16 digits total. Therefore, challenging now is risky. The minimal safe move is to increase the bid. I can bid 2 8s, which is a higher digit at the same count. Looking at my hand, I have no 8s, so bidding on 8s is risky. Alternatively, I could bid 3 1s, since I have two 1s (digits 1 and 5), making it plausible there is at least one more 1 in the opponent's hand. Bidding 3 1s is a safe and valid higher bid (increasing the count).\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 1\"\n}",
