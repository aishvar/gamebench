        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since my hand contains no 6s but does contain multiple 8s, bidding on a higher digit that I have more information on seems wise. However, I must also consider the likelihood of the digits based on the bids made. The bid of 3 6s suggests Player 1 might have at least one 6, but without more information, it's hard to assess the likelihood of this bid being true. Given my hand has two 8s and considering the bid history started with 2 8s, it might be reasonable to increase the quantity of a digit I have knowledge of, but since I must bid higher than 3 6s, I need to think about digits higher than 6 or increasing the quantity significantly for a lower digit. However, challenging seems like a viable option if I think the current bid is unlikely, but given I have no 6s and the bid is not extremely high, it might not be the best strategy without more information on the opposing player's hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 8s\"\n}",
