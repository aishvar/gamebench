You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, my hand is 49989581. That means I have the digits 4, 9, 9, 8, 9, 5, 8, 1. Let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\nLooking at each digit:\n- 0: I don't have any.\n- 1: I have one.\n- 4: One.\n- 5: One.\n- 8: Two.\n- 9: Three.\n\nSo, my counts are 1 for 1, 4, 5; 2 for 8; and 3 for 9. \n\nNow, the current bid is None, which means this is the first bid of the game. I need to make an opening bid. The rules say that each bid must be strictly higher than the previous one, but since there's no previous bid, I can start with any valid bid.\n\nI remember that in Liar's Poker, the key is to balance between making a bid that's likely to be true but also not overcommitting. Since I have three 9s, that's a significant number. But wait, the maximum any digit can have is 16 (since there are two players with 8 digits each). So, if I bid on 9s, I have three, but the opponent could have more, or maybe not. \n\nBut since I'm starting, maybe I should bid on a digit that I have a good number of, but not necessarily the highest. Let me think about the possible digits. \n\nIf I bid on 9s with a quantity of 3, that's a possible opening. But maybe I can go a bit higher. Wait, the quantity can be from 1 to 16, but I only have three 9s. So, if I bid 3 9s, that's a safe starting point because I know I have three, and the opponent might have none or some. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I have less of but maybe is more common. For example, 8s. I have two. If I bid 2 8s, that's also a possibility. But 3 9s seems stronger because 9s are higher digits, and higher digits are generally less common. \n\nWait, but in Liar's Poker, higher digits are riskier because they're less likely to be present in large quantities. So, maybe starting with a lower digit but a higher quantity could be safer. But I don't have higher quantities in lower digits. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 5s or 4s, but I only have one each. That might not be as strong. \n\nSo, considering I have three 9s, I think bidding 3 9s is a good opening. It's a solid bid because even if the opponent has zero, the total is three, which meets the bid. If they have more, it's even better. \n\nHowever, I should also consider that the opponent might have a lot of 9s, but that's less likely since each player only has 8 digits. The maximum the opponent could have is 8 9s, making the total 11, but that's very unlikely. \n\nWait, but in my hand, I have three 9s. The opponent could have up to 8, but that's improbable. So, bidding 3 9s is a safe bet because it's likely that the total is at least 3. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid higher, like 4 9s, but I only have three. If I do that, and the opponent has one, the total is four, which would make my bid valid. But if the opponent has none, then the total is three, which is less than four, and I would lose if challenged. \n\nSo, maybe it's safer to bid exactly what I have, which is 3 9s. That way, I know the total is at least three, and the opponent can't challenge it without losing unless they have negative 9s, which isn't possible. \n\nTherefore, I think the best move is to bid 3 9s. It's a strong opening that's hard to challenge because the minimum total is three, and it's likely higher.\n"
