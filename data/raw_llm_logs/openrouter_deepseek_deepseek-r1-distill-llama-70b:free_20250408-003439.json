        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, the current bid is 3 6s from Player 1. I need to either challenge this bid or make a higher bid. My hand is 45613306. Let me count how many 6s I have. Looking at my digits: 4,5,6,1,3,3,0,6. So I have two 6s. That's good to know because it gives me some information about the possible total.\n\nThe bid history shows that I previously bid 2 6s, and then Player 1 upped it to 3. Now it's my turn again. I have two 6s, so the total number of 6s in both players' hands must be at least 2. But Player 1 is claiming there are at least 3. Since I have two, that means Player 1 must have at least one 6. \n\nI wonder if Player 1 is bluffing. Maybe they don't have any 6s and are just trying to make me fold. But if I challenge, and the total is 3 or more, I lose. If it's less, I win. But with my two 6s, the minimum total is 2. If Player 1 has one, it's 3. If they have zero, it's 2. \n\nI don't have any information about Player 1's hand, but in Liar's Poker, players often try to balance between believable bids and bluffs. Bidding 3 6s when I already have two is a bit risky because it's possible, but not certain. \n\nAlternatively, I could try to bid higher. Since the current bid is 3 6s, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. If I go for quantity, I could bid 4 6s. But I only have two, so I need Player 1 to have at least two more, which might be a stretch. Alternatively, I could bid the same quantity but a higher digit, like 3 7s. But I don't know if there are enough 7s. \n\nWait, my hand doesn't have any 7s, so if I bid 3 7s, I'm relying on Player 1 having some. That might be risky because if they don't, I could be challenging a bid that's too high. \n\nAnother thought: since I have two 6s, and the current bid is 3, if I challenge, there's a 50% chance I'm right or wrong. It's a gamble. But if I bid 4 6s, I'm committing to a higher bid which might not hold. \n\nI think challenging might be safer here because the bid is on the edge. If Player 1 only has one 6, then the total is exactly 3, which meets their bid. So if I challenge, I lose. But if Player 1 has none, the total is 2, and I win. \n\nBut wait, if I challenge and the total is exactly 3, then the bid is valid, and I lose. So I need to decide if Player 1 is likely to have at least one 6. Since I have two, and they bid 3, they must think there are enough. Maybe they have one, making it exactly 3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps they have two, making it four in total. But without knowing, it's a bit uncertain. \n\nI'm leaning towards challenging because the bid is just one more than what I can confirm, and it's possible Player 1 is bluffing. Plus, if I challenge and win, I gain the advantage. If I lose, I just move on. \n\nSo, I think the best move is to challenge the bid.\n"
