This means Player 1 needs at least two '1's in their 8-digit hand for the bid to be true. The expected number of '1's in an 8-digit hand is 0.8. The probability of Player 1 having two or more '1's is relatively low (calculated using binomial probability, it's approximately 18.7%). Therefore, there is a high probability (around 81.3%) that the bid '3 1s' is false. While I could make a safe higher bid like '1 6s', '2 7s', or '2 8s' (since I have one '6', two '7's, and two '8's), the odds strongly favor challenging the current bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
