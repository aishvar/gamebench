You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, my hand is 36859025. Let me write that down so I can see each digit clearly: 3, 6, 8, 5, 9, 0, 2, 5. So I have two 5s, and one each of 3, 6, 8, 9, 0, and 2. That gives me a total of eight digits, which makes sense since each player has eight.\n\nThe current bid is None, which means this is the first bid of the round. I need to make an opening bid. My goal is to make a bid that's likely to be true but also gives me an advantage. Since I have two 5s, maybe I can bid on 5s. But I don't know what the other player has, so I have to be careful not to overbid.\n\nLooking at my digits, I have two 5s. The maximum possible for any digit is 16 because each player has eight. So, if I bid 2 5s, that's a safe starting point. But maybe I can go higher. If I bid 3 5s, that might be risky if the opponent doesn't have any. But since I have two, if the opponent has at least one, then the bid is good. \n\nAlternatively, I could consider other digits. I have a 9, which is a high digit. Bidding on 9s might be tricky because they are less common. If I bid 1 9s, that's safe, but it's a low quantity. But since the current bid is None, I can choose any digit and quantity. \n\nWait, but since it's the first bid, I should probably start with a moderate bid to not give away too much information. Let me think about the distribution. If I have two 5s, maybe the opponent has one or two as well. So 3 5s might be possible. But I don't want to bid too high and risk losing the challenge.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the most frequent digit in my hand. I have two 5s, which is the highest. So focusing on 5s makes sense. Bidding 2 5s is safe because I know I have two, but maybe I can go one higher to 3 5s. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit with a lower quantity. For example, 1 9s. But that might not be as strong because 9s are rare. If I bid 1 9s, the opponent might challenge it, thinking it's unlikely. \n\nI think the safest bet is to bid 2 5s. It's a solid starting point, and I know I have that in my hand. It's also a low enough quantity that the opponent might not want to challenge immediately. \n\nWait, but if I bid 2 5s, the opponent might have more 5s, making the total higher. But I don't know that. So maybe I should bid 3 5s to set a higher bar. \n\nHmm, but I don't want to overbid. If I bid 3 5s and the opponent has none, then I lose. But I have two, so the opponent needs at least one for it to be valid. The chance that the opponent has at least one 5 is decent, but not certain. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I have only one of, but with a higher digit value. For example, 1 9s. That might be a good move because 9s are high, and it's a low quantity. But again, if the opponent doesn't have a 9, I lose. \n\nI think I'll go with 2 5s. It's a moderate bid that I can back up with my hand, and it's less likely to be challenged immediately. Plus, if the opponent doesn't have any 5s, I can challenge their next bid more confidently. \n\nWait, but the current bid is None, so I have to make the first bid. Maybe starting with a higher quantity on a lower digit is better. For example, 3 3s. But I only have one 3, so that's risky. \n\nNo, I think sticking with 2 5s is the best move. It's safe and based on my actual hand. I can always adjust in the next turns based on the opponent's response.\n"
