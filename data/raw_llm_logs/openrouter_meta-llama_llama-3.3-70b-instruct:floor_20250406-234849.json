        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

Since I don't have any 8s in my hand and the bid is for '2 8s', it's possible that Player 1 has at least one 8, but without more information, it's hard to assess the likelihood of there being two 8s in total. However, considering the rules and aiming to make a strategic move, I should look for a digit that I have a good number of or a digit that is higher than 8 to bid on. Since 8 is a high digit and I don't have any, bidding on a higher digit isn't feasible. I have two 9s and two 2s, but bidding on 9s directly might be risky without knowing Player 1's hand. Given that the current bid is on a high digit (8), and I want to make a bid that is higher, I could consider bidding on a quantity increase for a digit I have, but given the information, challenging seems like a safer bet because I don't have to reveal my hand and can potentially win if the total count of 8s is less than 2.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
