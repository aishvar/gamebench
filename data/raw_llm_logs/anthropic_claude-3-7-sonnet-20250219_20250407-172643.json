While this is possible, it seems unlikely that they would have exactly 4 7s. The maximum possible number of 7s across both hands is 8 (if my opponent has 8 7s). Looking at my own hand, I notice I have three 9s, which is why I previously bid \\'3 9s\\'. To make a higher bid, I would need to either bid more 7s (5 or more) or bid any quantity of a higher digit (8s or 9s). Since I already know I have three 9s, I could bid \\'4 9s\\', but this would require my opponent to have at least one 9 in their hand, which is uncertain. Given that I have zero 7s and it\\'s unlikely my opponent has exactly 4 7s, challenging seems to be the better option.\",\\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\\n}', type='text')"
