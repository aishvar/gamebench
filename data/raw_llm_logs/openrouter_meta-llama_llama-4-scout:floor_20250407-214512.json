The current bid is 4 zeros. I have 8 secret digits in my hand: 52667167. Counting the zeros in my hand, I find 2 zeros. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and there are 2 players, I must consider if bidding higher or challenging is strategic. Since I have 2 zeros, if Player 0 has 2 or fewer zeros, the current bid of '4 0s' could be valid or even beatable. However, without exact information on Player 0's hand, I must make an educated guess. I can increase the quantity or the digit. A safe bet would be to increase the digit since I don't have information about other digits in Player 0's hand. I see an opportunity to bid on a higher digit that could potentially be more common.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: Q D\"\n}\n```",
