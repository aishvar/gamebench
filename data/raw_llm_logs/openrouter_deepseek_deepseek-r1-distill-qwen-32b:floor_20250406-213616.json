You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. I have the hand 55359176, which means my digits are 5, 5, 3, 5, 9, 1, 7, 6. That's eight digits in total. Since it's the first move, the current bid is None, so I need to make the initial bid.\n\nIn Liar's Poker, each player has eight digits, so there are 16 digits in total between both players. My goal is to bid on the total count of a specific digit across both hands. The bid must be a quantity and a digit, like '3 5s', meaning there are at least three 5s in total.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have three 5s. That's the highest count of any digit I have. The other digits appear only once or twice. So, if I bid on 5s, I can start with a quantity that's higher than what I have but still plausible. Since I have three, maybe I can bid four 5s. That way, I'm accounting for the possibility that the other player might have one or two more 5s.\n\nBut wait, I should consider the maximum possible. If I bid four 5s, the total could be four or more, but since there are only 16 digits, the maximum number of 5s possible is 16. So, four seems reasonable because even if the other player has one or two, it's unlikely they have more than that.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on another digit, but since 5s are my highest count, it makes sense to go with that. Plus, it's a higher digit than others, so if someone tries to outbid me, they'd have to go higher in quantity or a higher digit, which might be riskier for them.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to bid four 5s. That gives me a solid starting point and leaves room for the other player to have some 5s without making the bid too high. It also sets a higher bar for them to either increase the quantity or choose a higher digit, which they might be hesitant to do if they don't have enough of that digit.\n\nAnother consideration is that if the other player has no 5s, my bid of four 5s could still be valid if they have one or two. But since I have three, it's possible that the total is four or more, depending on their hand. It's a calculated risk, but I think it's a good starting bid.\n"
