While it's possible, it's somewhat unlikely given the average distribution (each digit appears about 1.6 times per player). The opponent increased from 2 to 3 '1's, possibly bluffing or confident. Overall, the probability they have at least two '1's is not very high. Therefore, challenging is a strategically sound move.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
