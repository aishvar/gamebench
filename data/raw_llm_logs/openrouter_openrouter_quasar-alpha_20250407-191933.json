Since I hold none, the entire bid depends on Player 0 holding both 3s, which is somewhat unlikely but plausible. Given that the bid is low (only 2), challenging is risky because it's quite possible Player 0 has two 3s. Instead, I can safely increase the bid by quantity or digit. I have two 1s, so I can confidently bid 2 1s, which is a valid higher bid (since digit 1 > 3 at same quantity). Alternatively, I can bid 3 of any digit I have multiple of. I have two 1s and one 0, 5, 7, 9, 8, 2, so safest is to bid 3 1s, assuming Player 0 might have at least one 1. This is a reasonable, safe incremental bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 1s\"\n}",
