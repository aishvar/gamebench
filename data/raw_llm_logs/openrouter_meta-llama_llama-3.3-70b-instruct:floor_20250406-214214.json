        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Looking at my hand, 69413127, I notice I don't have any 5s, which makes challenging the current bid of '2 5s' less risky since I have no contribution to the count of 5s. However, without knowing Player 0's hand, it's difficult to assess the likelihood of the bid being true. Considering the game has just started and the bid is relatively low, it might be beneficial to bid higher to put pressure on Player 0 and gain more information. Since I have two 1s and other digits, bidding on a digit I have could be strategic, but given the low current bid, I should aim to increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding on a digit I have in higher quantity or a higher digit seems like a good strategy. However, since I don't have a clear advantage with any digit to confidently bid higher without risking too much, and considering the current bid is not extremely high, challenging might be a safer option to test Player 0's confidence and hand strength early in the game.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
