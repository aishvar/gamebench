You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, let's break down the situation step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the game. I'm Player 1, and it's my turn. The current bid is 4 7s made by Player 0. The bid history shows that Player 0 started with 2 9s, then I bid 3 7s, and Player 0 countered with 4 7s. \n\nLooking at my hand: 83975720. Let's count the digits I have. The digits are 8, 3, 9, 7, 5, 7, 2, 0. So, I have two 7s. \n\nThe current bid is 4 7s. Since I have two 7s, I know there are at least two 7s in the game. However, Player 0's bid is 4, which means they're claiming there are at least four 7s across both hands. \n\nConsidering the maximum possible digits in play, there are 16 digits in total (8 from each player). If Player 0 is bidding 4 7s, that's a significant claim. But since I only have two, maybe they have two as well, making it four in total. \n\nHowever, I should also think about the likelihood of Player 0 having more 7s. If they have two 7s, that would make the total four, which matches their bid. But if they have fewer, say one, then the total would be three, which is less than four, making their bid invalid. \n\nBut wait, I have two 7s, and if Player 0 has two, that's four. But if they have three, that would make it five, which would make their bid of four valid. But I don't have information about their hand. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to bluff. They might not have that many 7s. Considering the previous bids, I went from 3 7s to their 4 7s. They might be trying to push the bid higher to see if I challenge or if I can't go higher. \n\nI need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. To bid higher, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. The current bid is 4 7s. The next possible bid could be 5 7s, but that's risky because I only have two. Alternatively, I could bid 4 8s, which is a higher digit but same quantity. \n\nBut looking at my hand, I have an 8, but only one. Bidding 4 8s would be a big claim, and I'm not sure if that's feasible. Alternatively, I could bid 5 7s, but that's a stretch because I only have two. \n\nAnother option is to challenge. If I challenge, the actual count of 7s will be revealed. If it's less than 4, I win. If it's 4 or more, Player 0 wins. \n\nGiven that I have two 7s, the total could be four if Player 0 has two, or more if they have three or four. But considering the previous bids, Player 0 might be trying to escalate the bid to see if I can't match. \n\nI think challenging might be the safer move here. If I challenge and the count is less than 4, I win. If it's exactly four, I lose, but I have a 50% chance if I assume Player 0 has two. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 5 7s, it's a higher bid, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Since I have two, and assuming Player 0 has two, the total is four, so 5 would be invalid. \n\nTherefore, challenging seems like the better option here. It's a calculated risk, but given the information, it's a reasonable move.\n"
