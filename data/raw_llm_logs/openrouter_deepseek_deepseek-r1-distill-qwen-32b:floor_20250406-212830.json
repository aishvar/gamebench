                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out what move to make in this Liar's Poker game. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the game rules: each player has 8 secret digits, and we take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit across both hands. The bid has to be strictly higher than the previous one, either by quantity or digit. If I can't make a higher bid, I can challenge the last bid.\n\nRight now, it's my turn, and the current bid is 'None', which means I'm the first to bid. The bid history is empty, so I don't have any previous bids to consider.\n\nLooking at my hand: 03368116. Let me count the digits I have:\n\n- 0: one\n- 3: two\n- 6: two\n- 8: one\n- 1: two\n\nSo, I have two 3s, two 6s, and two 1s. The other digits are present once or not at all.\n\nSince I'm the first to bid, I can choose any digit and quantity. My goal is to make a bid that's likely to be correct, but also gives me a good chance to win if challenged.\n\nLet's consider the digits I have:\n\n- 3s: I have two. Since there are two players, the maximum a digit can appear is 16 (8 each). But realistically, the total count depends on both hands. If I bid on 3s, maybe I can go higher than just my count.\n\nWait, but since I'm the first to bid, I can set the bar. Maybe I should choose a digit that I have multiple of, to make the bid more confident.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 6s, and two 1s. Let's think about which digit is more likely to have a higher total.\n\nIf I bid on 3s, I have two. The other player could have some 3s, but it's possible the total is higher. But maybe it's safer to bid on a digit where I have more.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 6s. I have two, so maybe I can bid 3 6s. That would mean I'm confident there are at least three 6s in total. But wait, I only have two. Maybe that's too optimistic.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 1s. I have two, so maybe 3 1s. But again, I'm not sure about the other player's hand.\n\nWait, but since I'm the first to bid, maybe I should start with a lower quantity but a higher digit to set a higher bar for the next player. For example, bidding 3 9s. But I don't have any 9s, so that might be risky.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I have multiple of, like 3s or 6s, with a quantity that's just above the number I have. For example, 3 3s. Since I have two, maybe the total is three.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider the possible maximums. The maximum for any digit is 16, but that's extremely unlikely. The total count is 16 digits (8 each), so the maximum any digit can have is 16, but realistically, it's much lower.\n\nWait, but the current bid is 'None', so I can bid any quantity and digit. Maybe I should choose a digit that's less likely to be challenged. For example, if I bid on 0s, which I have one, but the other player might not have any, making the total count low. So bidding 2 0s might be risky.\n\nAlternatively, if I bid on 8s, which I have one, but again, the other player might not have any.\n\nHmm, maybe I should go with a digit I have more of. I have two 3s, two 6s, and two 1s. Let's say I bid 3 3s. That means I'm claiming there are at least three 3s in total. Since I have two, maybe the other player has one. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 6s, since I have two, and maybe the other player has one. Or 3 1s.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should bid on a higher digit to make it harder for the next player to outbid me. For example, bidding 3 9s, but I don't have any 9s, so that's risky.\n\nWait, but I'm the first to bid, so I can set the initial bar. Maybe I should choose a digit that's in the middle, like 5s, and bid 3 5s. But I don't have any 5s, so that's a bluff.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I have, like 3s, with a quantity that's just above my count. For example, 3 3s.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider the possible counts. If I bid 3 3s, and the other player has one, the total is three, which would make my bid correct. If they have none, the total is two, which would make my bid wrong.\n\nBut since I'm the first to bid, maybe it's better to start with a lower quantity but a higher digit to set a higher bar. For example, 3 9s. But again, I don't have any, so that's a bluff.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 3s, but since I have two, that's a safe bid. But since the current bid is 'None', I can bid any quantity, but I have to make it higher than 'None', which is effectively zero. So the first bid can be any quantity and digit.\n\nWait, the rules say that the first bid must be strictly higher than 'None', which means any bid is acceptable as the first move. So I can choose any quantity and digit.\n\nConsidering that, maybe I should bid on a digit I have multiple of, with a quantity that's just above my count. For example, I have two 3s, so I could bid 3 3s. That would mean I'm confident there are at least three 3s in total.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 6s, which I have two, so 3 6s. Or 1s, 3 1s.\n\nBut I'm not sure which is better. Maybe 3 3s is a good choice because it's a higher digit than 1s, making it harder for the next player to outbid me with the same quantity.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 4 3s, but that's a higher quantity, which might be too optimistic.\n\nWait, but if I bid 4 3s, and the total is only three, then the next player could challenge and win. So maybe 3 3s is safer.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 6s, since I have two, and maybe the other player has one. That would make the total three, which would make my bid correct.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider the possible distribution. If I bid 3 6s, and the other player has one, the total is three. If they have none, the total is two, which would make my bid wrong.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should bid on a digit I have more of, like 3s, with a quantity that's just above my count.\n\nSo, I think I'll go with bidding 3 3s. That way, I'm making a reasonable claim that there are at least three 3s in total, considering I have two and the other player might have one.\n"
