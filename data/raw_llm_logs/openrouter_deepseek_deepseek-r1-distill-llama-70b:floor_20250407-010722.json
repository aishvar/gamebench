        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. I need to figure out what to do. The current bid is None, which means the game is just starting, and I'm the first to bid. My hand is 5,9,8,6,3,4,1,9. Let me count how many of each digit I have.\n\nStarting with 0s: I don't have any. 1s: I have one. 2s: None. 3s: One. 4s: One. 5s: One. 6s: One. 7s: None. 8s: One. 9s: Two. So the digits I have are spread out, with 9 being the most frequent.\n\nSince it's the first bid, I can choose any digit and quantity. I want to make a bid that's reasonable but not too high, so I don't get challenged right away. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s. So maybe I can bid 2 9s. That seems safe because I have two, and the opponent might have none or some. Alternatively, I could bid a higher quantity on a lower digit, but I don't have enough of any other digit to make a higher bid.\n\nWait, another thought: if I bid 2 9s, the opponent might have more 9s, making the total higher than 2. But since I have two, even if they have none, the total is two, which meets my bid. If they have one, it's three, which is still higher. So it's a safe bet.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I have only one of, but that might be riskier because if the opponent has none, the total would be one, which could be lower than my bid if I bid higher. So sticking with 9s seems better.\n\nI think I'll go with BID: 2 9s. It's a solid starting point, and I have the count in my hand to back it up.\n"
