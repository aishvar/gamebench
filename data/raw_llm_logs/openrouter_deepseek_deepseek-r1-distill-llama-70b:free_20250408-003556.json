        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and I need to decide what to do next. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at my hand. I have the digits 5, 3, 7, 8, 7, 1, 5, 0. So that's two 5s, two 7s, one 8, one 3, one 1, and one 0. So I have eight digits in total, and I know that the other player also has eight, making 16 digits in the game.\n\nThe current bid is 2 8s from Player 1. I need to either bid higher or challenge. Let me consider both options.\n\nIf I challenge, I need to think about whether there are at least two 8s in total. I have one 8 in my hand, so if the other player has at least one 8, the bid is valid. If not, then challenging would be a good move because the total would be only one 8, making the bid of 2 8s false.\n\nBut wait, the other player might have more than one 8. They could have two or even more. So the total could be three or more 8s. Since I only have one, I can't be sure. So maybe challenging is risky because there's a chance the bid is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to make a higher bid. The current bid is 2 8s. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Let me see what I can do.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 5s and two 7s. If I can make a bid based on that, maybe I can go for a higher quantity or a higher digit. For example, I could bid 3 5s, but I only have two, so that's not possible. Wait, no, because the total count includes both players. So if I have two 5s, maybe the other player has one or more, making the total three or four. But I don't know their hand.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid a higher digit. Since 8 is the current digit, the next higher digit is 9, but I don't have any 9s. So I can't bid 9s. The next option is to increase the quantity. The current bid is 2 8s, so I could bid 3 8s. But I only have one 8, so unless the other player has two, that might not be safe. If I bid 3 8s and there are only two in total, I'd lose.\n\nWait, maybe I can look at other digits. I have two 7s. The current bid is 2 8s. Since 7 is lower than 8, I can't just bid 2 7s because it's a lower digit. I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. So if I have two 7s, maybe I can bid 3 7s if I think the total is at least three. But I only have two, so the other player would need at least one 7. If they have one or two, that could make the total three or four. But I don't know their hand.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 9s, but I don't have any 9s, so that's risky. Or maybe bid 2 0s. I have one 0, so if the other player has one, that's two. But I don't know.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me think about the possible bids I can make. The current bid is 2 8s. I can either increase the quantity to 3 8s or go for a higher digit with the same quantity, like 2 9s, but I don't have any 9s, so that's risky. Alternatively, I can go for a lower digit but higher quantity, but that's not allowed because the bid must be strictly higher.\n\nWait, no, the bid must be strictly higher, which can be either higher quantity or higher digit. So if I can't go higher in digit, I can try higher quantity.\n\nI have two 5s. If I bid 3 5s, that's higher than 2 8s because 5 is lower than 8, but the quantity is higher. Wait, no. The bid is evaluated first by quantity, then by digit. So 3 5s is a higher bid than 2 8s because 3 > 2. So I can make that bid.\n\nBut do I have enough 5s? I have two, so the other player would need at least one more 5 to make the total three. If the other player has one 5, then yes, the total is three. If they have none, then the total is two, which is less than my bid of three, so I'd lose.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 7s, but wait, 7 is higher than 5 but lower than 8. So 2 7s is lower than 2 8s because the digit is lower. So that's not a valid higher bid.\n\nWait, no. The current bid is 2 8s. To make a higher bid, I can either have a higher quantity or a higher digit. So 3 of any digit is higher than 2 of a higher digit. So 3 0s would be higher than 2 8s because 3 > 2.\n\nSo, considering that, I can bid 3 5s because I have two, and if the other player has at least one, it's valid. Alternatively, I can bid 3 7s, but I only have two, so same situation.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 0s, but I only have one 0. So that's risky unless the other player has two 0s, which is possible but not certain.\n\nSo, which is the safest bet? I think bidding 3 5s is a possibility because I have two, and there's a chance the other player has at least one. Alternatively, I could challenge the current bid of 2 8s.\n\nIf I challenge, and the total is only one 8 (if the other player has none), I win. If the total is two or more, I lose. So the risk is that the other player might have one or two 8s.\n\nGiven that, maybe challenging is a good option because I only have one 8, and the other player might not have another. But it's also possible they have one or two, making the bid valid.\n\nAlternatively, I can make a bid that I'm more confident about. I have two 5s, so I can bid 3 5s. If the other player has at least one 5, then the bid is good. If not, I lose.\n\nI think the safer option might be to challenge because the current bid is 2 8s, and I only have one. If the other player has one, it's exactly two, so the bid is valid. If they have none, I win. But if they have two, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, making a bid of 3 5s could be safer because I have two, and the chance that the other player has at least one is decent. It's possible they have one or two, making the total three or four.\n\nI think I'll go with challenging because I don't want to risk making a bid that might not hold, especially since I don't have enough information about the other player's 5s or 8s. Challenging might be the better move here.\n"
