Since I hold 8 digits, and the opponent holds 8 digits, the total number of 4s across both hands can be at most 16. However, since I have zero 4s, the entire bid hinges on whether the opponent has at least one 4. Given the naive 50/50 opponent, the probability they have at least one 4 is roughly 1 minus the probability they have zero 4s. The chance they have no 4s is (9/10)^8 \u2248 0.43, so the chance they have at least one 4 is about 57%. Given this, the bid of 1 4s is plausible but uncertain. Since the bid is minimal and quite likely to be true, challenging now is risky. Instead, I can safely increase the bid conservatively to 1 5s, as I hold one 5 in my hand (digit '5' is absent; correction: no 5s in my hand). Actually, I have no 5s, so bidding 1 5s is risky. Checking for other digits: I have two 7s, so I can confidently bid 2 7s, which raises the quantity, a valid bid. This is a safe and strong bid based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 7s\"\n}",
