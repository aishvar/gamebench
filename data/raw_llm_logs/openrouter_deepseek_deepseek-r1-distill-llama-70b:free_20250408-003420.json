        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. My hand is 45613306. The current bid is None, which means I get to start the bidding. I need to decide what to bid or if I should challenge, but since there's no previous bid, I can't challenge. So I have to make the first bid.\n\nFirst, I should look at my hand and count the digits. Let's see, my digits are 4, 5, 6, 1, 3, 3, 0, 6. So breaking it down:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 1\n- 3: 2\n- 4: 1\n- 5: 1\n- 6: 2\n\nSo the digits I have are 0,1,3,4,5,6. The counts are mostly 1s, except for 3 and 6, which are 2 each.\n\nSince I'm starting, I can choose any digit and any quantity. The goal is to bid in a way that's likely to be true but also gives me an advantage. I don't want to bid too high because the opponent might challenge, but I also want to set a foundation that I can build on.\n\nLooking at my counts, I have two 3s and two 6s. So maybe I can bid 2 3s or 2 6s. Alternatively, I could bid 1 on any of the other digits.\n\nBut since I have two of 3 and 6, it's safer to bid a higher quantity on a digit I have more of. Bidding 2 3s or 2 6s seems reasonable. Between the two, 6 is a higher digit than 3, so bidding 2 6s might be better because if I can later increase the digit, it's a stronger position.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 1 on a higher digit like 5, but that might not be as strong. Starting with 2 6s gives me a solid base. Also, since the maximum per digit is 16, but with two players, the opponent might have 0-8 of any digit, so 2 is a safe start.\n\nI think I'll go with 2 6s. It's a moderate bid that's likely true and sets the stage for possible higher bids later.\n"
