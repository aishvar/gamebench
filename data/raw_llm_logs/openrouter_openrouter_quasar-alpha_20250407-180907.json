To continue the game and avoid a risky challenge, I can safely increase the quantity of sixes to 5, which is still quite plausible given 16 total digits. Alternatively, I could increase the digit to a higher one with at least 4 quantity, but increasing quantity is simpler and safer here.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 5 6s\"\n}",
