        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 7s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

Since I have 1 seven, that means Player 0 would need to have at least 2 sevens for this bid to be true. That\\'s certainly possible. I could challenge, but it seems like a risky move since the bid is relatively low (only claiming 3 out of 16 possible digits). Instead, I should make a higher bid. I could bid \\'4 7s\\', but that would be risky since I only have 1 seven. I could bid \\'3 8s\\' or \\'3 9s\\', increasing the digit while keeping the same quantity. Looking at my hand, I have one 9, so bidding \\'3 9s\\' would mean Player 0 needs to have at least 2 nines. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to 4 with a lower digit. I have two 4s in my hand, so bidding \\'4 4s\\' would mean Player 0 needs to have at least 2 fours. This seems reasonable. I\\'ll go with \\'4 4s\\'.\", \"action\": \"BID: 4 4s\"}', type='text')"
