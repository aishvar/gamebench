You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to make the first bid in this Liar's Poker game. My hand is 78455387. Let me count the digits here. \n\nFirst, let's list out my digits: 7, 8, 4, 5, 5, 3, 8, 7. \n\nBreaking them down:\n- 7 appears twice (positions 1 and 7)\n- 8 appears twice (positions 2 and 7)\nWait, no, position 7 is 8? Wait, let me recount. The hand is 7,8,4,5,5,3,8,7. So positions 1:7, 2:8, 3:4, 4:5, 5:5, 6:3, 7:8, 8:7. So yes, 7 is at positions 1 and 8, so two 7s. 8 is at 2 and 7, so two 8s. 5 is at 4 and 5, so two 5s. The 4,3 are single. \n\nSo my counts:\n- 3:1\n-4:1\n-5:2\n-7:2\n-8:2\n- others (like 0,1,2,6,9) have 0 in my hand.\n\nSince the current bid is None, I have to make the first bid. The bid has to be a quantity and a digit. The bid must be strictly higher than None, so any bid is valid as the first move. But to be strategic, I should choose a bid that's likely to be sustainable but also gives me a good position.\n\nThe first bid usually starts low, but maybe I can use the digits I have. Since I have two 5s, two 7s, and two 8s, maybe bid on one of those. \n\nIf I bid on 5s, I have two, so maybe bid 3 5s? But that's risky if the opponent doesn't have any. Alternatively, maybe go for a lower quantity but higher digit. Wait, the first bid can be anything. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a bid that's slightly higher. Let's think: the total digits are 16 (8 each). The first bid could be, say, 3 of a digit. Let's see which digit might have a better chance. \n\nLooking at my hand, the digits I have in pairs are 5,7,8. Maybe choosing 8s since it's a higher digit. If I bid 3 8s, then even if the opponent has one or two, the total would be 3 or 4. But if I bid 3 8s, that requires that there are at least three 8s in total. Since I have two, the opponent would need at least one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 9s. Since I have none, but that's a high digit. But since it's the first bid, maybe starting with a higher digit is better. Wait, the bid can be any digit. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, start with a bid that's easy to defend. Since I have two of 5,7,8, maybe bid 3 5s. But maybe the opponent has none. Alternatively, maybe bid 2 of a higher digit. Wait, but the first bid can be any, but the next player has to either challenge or raise.\n\nWait, the rules say a bid must be strictly higher than the previous. Since the first bid can be anything, but the next must be higher in quantity or same quantity but higher digit. \n\nSince I'm starting, maybe I want to pick a bid that's not too high but gives me flexibility. Let's see. The minimal bid would be 1 of any digit, but that's too easy. Maybe 3 of a digit. For example, 3 8s. Since I have two, if the opponent has one, that's 3. If they have zero, then it's 2, which would be a loss if challenged. But maybe it's better to start with 2 of a higher digit. Wait, but the first bid can be any. Alternatively, maybe 4 7s? But I only have two. That's a lie, but maybe the opponent doesn't have any. Hmm, but I should think strategically.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 3 5s. I have two, so maybe they have one. That could work. Or 3 8s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe go for a lower digit but higher quantity. Like 4 3s. But I have only one 3. That's risky. \n\nAlternatively, bid 2 9s. Since I have none, but if the opponent doesn't have any, then challenging would win. But since it's the first bid, maybe that's too risky. \n\nAlternatively, start with a bid that's likely to be true. Since I have two 5s, maybe bid 3 5s. The opponent has 8 digits, so maybe they have one 5. Then total is 3. That's possible. \n\nAlternatively, since I have two 8s, bid 3 8s. Let's see, opponent might have one, so total 3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 9s. Since 9 is a higher digit, but I have none. If I bid 2 9s, the opponent might have none, so challenging would win. But as the first bid, maybe that's a good move. Because if I bid 2 9s, then the next player has to bid higher in quantity or same quantity but higher digit. Wait, but 9 is the highest digit. So if they want to raise the quantity, they can go to 3 9s, but if they don't have any, that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first bid should be a low quantity but high digit to make it hard for the opponent to raise. For example, 1 9, but that's easy to challenge. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, since I have two of several digits, maybe bid 3 of one of them. Let's see, if I bid 3 8s, then the opponent would need to have at least one. If they don't, then challenging would win. But if they do, then it's okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 2 8s. But since the bid must be strictly higher than none, any bid is okay. Wait, the first bid can be anything. The key is that the next bid must be higher than it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a bid that's easy to defend. Since I have two 5s, maybe bid 3 5s. Let's see: my two plus opponent's possible ones. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 4 7s. Since I have two, but that's higher. But that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, start with 3 8s. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the safest first bid is to bid 2 of a high digit. Wait, but the first bid can be any. Let me think again. \n\nThe first move: the bid has to be the first, so any bid is allowed. But to make it hard for the opponent to raise, maybe choose a high digit with a low quantity. For example, 2 9s. Then the next player can either challenge or raise. To raise, they can either increase quantity (to 3 9s) or keep quantity same but higher digit, but 9 is the highest. So the next player has to go to 3 9s. But if they don't have enough, they might be forced to challenge. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 9s, since I have none, but maybe the opponent also has none. Then if they challenge, I lose. But since I have no 9s, the total would be whatever the opponent has. If they have none, then the bid was 2 9s but actual is 0, so challenger wins. But I can't know. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe start with a bid based on my own hand. Since I have two of 5,7,8, maybe bid 3 of one of those. Let's pick 3 8s. Because 8 is a high digit, so even if they have one, it's okay. \n\nAlternatively, bid 3 7s. I have two, so they need one. \n\nAlternatively, bid 3 5s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 4 3s. But I have only one. That's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a bid that's 2 of a high digit. For example, 2 9s. But again, I have none. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 3 4s. Since I have one, but the opponent might have two. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's think of the best first move. \n\nIn Liar's Poker, the first bid is often a low quantity but high digit to make it harder for others to raise. For example, starting with 1 ace (1s) is bad, but starting with a high digit like 9 even with a low quantity can be good. \n\nAlternatively, since I have two 8s, maybe bid 3 8s. Let's see: I have two, so if the opponent has one, total is 3. If they have none, then the bid is wrong, so challenging would win if they challenge. But if I bid 3 8s and they have none, they might challenge. \n\nAlternatively, bid 2 8s. Since I have two, that's exactly my count. But since the bid must be higher than none, any bid is okay. But 2 8s is a valid bid, but then the next player can raise to 3 8s or 2 9s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe go for a higher quantity but lower digit. Like 4 5s. But I have two. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, let's look at the digits I have. The two 8s are the highest. So maybe bid 3 8s. \n\nAlternatively, since the first bid can be anything, perhaps start with a bid that's slightly higher than what you have. Since I have two, bid three. \n\nSo I think I'll go with BID: 3 8s. Because I have two, so if the opponent has at least one, it's valid. It's a high digit, so the next player has to either go higher in quantity or same quantity but higher digit (but 8 is already high, so next could be 3 9s, which would be higher digit. But 9 is higher than 8, so that's allowed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent might challenge, but since I have two, if they have one, total is 3. If they have none, then challenge would win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower bid to stay safe. Like 2 8s. But then the next player can easily raise to 3 8s or 2 9s. \n\nHmm. Maybe better to start with 3 8s as a first bid. That gives me a bit of a lead. \n\nSo, the reasoning would be that I have two 8s, so bidding 3 8s is a reasonable first move, assuming the opponent might have at least one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe even bid 4 8s? But that's risky. \n\nNo, better to start with 3. \n\nSo the action would be BID: 3 8s. \n\nWait, let me confirm the digits again. My hand is 7,8,4,5,5,3,8,7. So two 8s. So if I bid 3 8s, the total needs to be at least 3. If the opponent has at least one, then it's valid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 3 7s. I have two, so same logic. \n\nBut 8 is a higher digit than 7, so 3 8s is better because it's a higher digit. \n\nYes, so I think that's the best move. \n\n**Final Answer**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 8s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 3 8s leverages the high digit value and assumes the opponent might have at least one 8, making the total count plausible.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 8s\"\n}"
