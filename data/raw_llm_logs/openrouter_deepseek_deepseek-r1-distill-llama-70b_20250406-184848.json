        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, let's see. I'm playing Liar's Poker, and I need to figure out my next move. The current bid is 2 6s from Player 0. My hand is 85376057. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at my own digits. I've got 8,5,3,7,6,0,5,7. So, I have one 6, two 5s, two 7s, and the rest are single digits. The current bid is 2 6s, so Player 0 is claiming that between both of us, there are at least two 6s.\n\nI only have one 6 in my hand. So, if Player 0 has at least one more 6, the bid is valid. But if they have none, then the total would be just one, making the bid false. I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid.\n\nLooking at the bid history, Player 0 started with 2 2s, which I countered with 2 5s, and then Player 0 went to 2 6s. It seems like they're testing higher digits. Now, considering my hand, I have two 5s and two 7s. Maybe I can use that to my advantage.\n\nIf I challenge the 2 6s bid, and if the total is indeed less than 2, I win. But if it's 2 or more, I lose. Given that I only have one 6, the opponent must have at least one for the bid to be true. But I don't know their hand. It's a bit risky.\n\nAlternatively, I could make a higher bid. Since my hand has two 5s and two 7s, perhaps I can bid on those. Bidding on 5s or 7s might be safer because I can guarantee at least that number. For example, I could bid 2 7s, which is higher than 2 6s because 7 is a higher digit. Or I could even go higher in quantity if I think it's plausible.\n\nWait, the current bid is 2 6s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 7s, bidding 2 7s would be a valid higher bid. It's safer because I know I have two, and the opponent might not have more than one. Alternatively, I could bid 3 5s, but I only have two, so that's risky unless I think the opponent has at least one more 5.\n\nI think the safest move is to bid 2 7s. It's a higher digit than 6, and I have two of them, so I can be confident that at least two exist. Plus, it keeps the pressure on the opponent without overcommitting.\n\nSo, I'll go with bidding 2 7s. It's a strategic move that uses my known digits to make a higher, safer bid.\n"
