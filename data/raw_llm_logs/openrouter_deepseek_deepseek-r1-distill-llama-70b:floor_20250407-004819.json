You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn to act. Let me try to figure out what to do here. The current bid is 2 3s, made by Player 0. I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid.\n\nFirst, let me look at my hand. I have the digits 4, 3, 9, 1, 9, 8, 5, 2. So, I should count how many of each digit I have. Let's see:\n\n- 0: 0\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 1\n- 3: 1\n- 4: 1\n- 5: 1\n- 6: 0\n- 7: 0\n- 8: 1\n- 9: 2\n\nSo, I have one 3, and two 9s. The current bid is 2 3s. Since the total number of 3s in both players' hands is what matters, I need to consider how many 3s Player 0 might have.\n\nPlayer 0 has 8 secret digits as well. Since I have one 3, Player 0 could have up to 15 - 1 = 14 other digits, but that's not helpful. Wait, no, each digit is counted across both hands. So, the total number of 3s could be up to 16 (8 each from both players). But realistically, it's less.\n\nThe current bid is 2 3s. So, the total number of 3s in both hands needs to be at least 2. Since I have one 3, Player 0 must have at least one 3 to make the total 2. But could they have more? Maybe, but I don't know.\n\nI need to decide if challenging is a good move. If I challenge and the total is 2 or more, I lose. If it's less than 2, I win. But since I have one 3, the minimum total is 1 (if Player 0 has none). But that's possible? Wait, no, because Player 0 made the bid of 2 3s. So, they must have some confidence. Maybe they have at least one 3, making the total 2. Or perhaps they have two, making the total 3.\n\nAlternatively, I could make a higher bid. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the current bid is 2 3s, I can bid 3 of a higher digit or the same digit with a higher quantity. Let's see what digits I have that could be bid higher.\n\nI have two 9s. So, I could bid 2 9s, but wait, 2 9s is higher than 2 3s because 9 is higher than 3. So, that's a valid bid. Alternatively, I could bid 3 of a digit if I have enough. But I only have two 9s, so I can't bid 3 9s. But I could bid 2 9s, which would be a higher bid than 2 3s.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid a higher quantity on the same digit, like 3 3s, but I only have one 3, so I don't know if there are enough in total.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves:\n\nOption 1: Challenge the bid. If the total 3s are 2 or more, I lose. If it's 1 or 0, I win. Since I have one 3, the minimum total is 1. If Player 0 has at least one 3, the total is 2. So, challenging might be risky because there's a good chance the total is exactly 2, which would make me lose.\n\nOption 2: Bid 2 9s. Since I have two 9s, and the total could be up to 2 (if Player 0 has none) or more. But 2 9s is a valid higher bid because 9 > 3. This seems safer because I know I have two 9s, and even if Player 0 has none, the bid would still be valid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 9s, but I only have two, so that's not possible. Or bid 2 of a higher digit than 3 but lower than 9, but that might not be necessary.\n\nSo, making a bid of 2 9s seems like a good move. It's a higher bid, and I have the necessary cards to support it. Plus, it puts the pressure back on Player 0 to either challenge or make an even higher bid.\n\nI think I'll go with bidding 2 9s because it's a solid move based on my hand, and it's a higher bid than the current one.\n"
