        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

However, to make a bid, I need to increase either the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have enough information about the opponent's hand to confidently challenge, and I have a couple of digits that could potentially be common, I should look for a reasonable increase. Noticing my hand, I have multiple occurrences of the digit 4 and other digits, but none of them are 5 or higher in a quantity that would comfortably allow me to bid higher than 3 5s without risking a challenge. Given the digits I have, bidding on a digit I actually possess could be safer, but since I must bid higher, I could consider bidding on a higher digit assuming my opponent might not have it in abundance either. However, without specific knowledge of their hand, any bid I make is speculative. Considering the safest increase would be to bid on a digit that is at least as likely to appear as the 5, and knowing that 4s and other lower digits are less risky but must be in higher quantities, I could consider a bid that reflects a balance between likelihood and the information I have from my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 0s\"\n}",
