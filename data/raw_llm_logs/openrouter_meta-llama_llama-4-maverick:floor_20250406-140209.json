        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 3 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '7 0s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 24 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

The total count of 0s across all players is at least 7 because the current bid is 7 0s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since I have no information about the other players' hands, I'll focus on the digits I have. I have multiple digits, but none of them are in high count in my hand except for 8 (2 counts). However, bidding on 8s might not be the best strategy without knowing others' hands. The next highest digit after 0 is 1, but I only have one 1. I can bid on a higher digit than 0 with the same quantity (7) or increase the quantity. The next possible bid with the same quantity (7) would be 7 1s. I have one 1, so it's possible that others have 6 or more 1s. Increasing the quantity to 8 is also an option, and I can bid 8 0s or 8 1s. Given that I have one 1 and it's likely others might have 1s as well, bidding 7 1s seems reasonable. It's a bit of a gamble but it's a valid bid that is higher than 7 0s.\", \"action\": \"BID: 7 1s\"}",
