        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 7s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

However, to make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have enough information about the distribution of digits in Player 1's hand, I will consider the digits in my hand to make a strategic decision. I have multiple occurrences of the digits 5 and 8. Given that bidding on a digit I have more of could be beneficial, I could consider bidding on one of these digits if it's higher than 7 or if I can increase the quantity. However, since 7 is a relatively high digit and I have no 7s, I might be taking a risk by bidding higher on a digit I don't have. On the other hand, challenging the bid could be risky as well because I don't know the actual count of 7s in Player 1's hand. Considering my options, I could bid on a higher digit that I have in my hand, like 8, but I only have one 8. Thus, I must decide whether to challenge or find a safe bid. Given the information and the rules, a safe bid would be to increase the quantity of a digit that is not too high, considering I don't have 7s and don't want to overbid on a digit I have no control over. But since I must bid higher, I should look for a digit that is either higher than 7 or the same but with a higher quantity. Since I don't have enough 8s to safely bid 2 8s (considering the bid needs to be strictly higher and I don't know what Player 1 has), and bidding on a digit higher than 8 is not possible since 9 is the highest digit, my safest option seems to be to challenge the current bid, hoping that Player 1 overbid on 7s.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
