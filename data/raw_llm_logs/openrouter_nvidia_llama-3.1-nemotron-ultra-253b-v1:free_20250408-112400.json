        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 4s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since I have one 4, the total could be at least 1 (mine) plus potentially some from the opponent. However, the opponent might not have any 4s. Bidding higher than 2 4s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. If I bid 3 4s, the total might not reach that if the opponent has none. Alternatively, I can bid 2 5s, which is a higher digit. But I have no 5s, so that's risky. Another option is to bid 3 5s, which increases both quantity and digit. However, without knowing the opponent's cards, it's safer to challenge if the bid is 2 4s, considering the low quantity and the possibility that the opponent might be bluffing. But challenging now might be too early. Alternatively, I can make a conservative bid. Since I have one 4, maybe the total is 2, so the bid is valid. To avoid giving away information, I should bid higher. Let's see, the next possible bid could be 3 4s, but if I don't have confidence, maybe switch to a higher digit. For example, 2 5s. But I have no 5s, so that's risky. Alternatively, 2 6s. I have two 6s. So total 6s could be 2 (mine) plus opponent's. If I bid 3 6s, that's possible. But opponent might challenge. Alternatively, bid 2 7s. I have two 7s. So total 7s could be 2. But the bid needs to be higher than 2 4s. Since 7 is higher than 4, 2 7s is a valid higher bid. That might be a good move, using my own 7s to make a safe bid. So I'll go with 3 7s, but wait, I have two 7s. If I bid 3 7s, the total needs to be at least 3. But I only have two, so unless the opponent has one, it's risky. Alternatively, bid 2 7s. That's same quantity but higher digit, which is valid. Since I have two 7s, the total is at least 2. So 2 7s is a safe bid. That way, I can increase the bid without overcommitting. So the action is to bid 2 7s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 7s\"\n}",
