You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to decide whether to challenge the current bid of 4 6s or make a higher bid. First, my hand is 65454960. Let me count the 6s in my hand. The digits are 6,5,4,5,4,9,6,0. So there are two 6s here. \n\nThe current bid is 4 6s from Player 1. Since I only have two, maybe I can challenge? But wait, maybe the opponent has more. The total digits between both players are 16. If the bid is 4 6s, the total must be at least 4. Since I have two, the opponent could have two or more. If they have two, total is four. So challenging might be risky because the bid could be exactly met. \n\nAlternatively, I could raise the bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity (to 5 6s, but that's tough since I only have two) or keep the same quantity but higher digit. Since the current bid is 4 6s, a higher digit would be 7-9. For example, 4 7s, 4 8s, etc. \n\nLooking at my hand for higher digits: I have a 9 and a 5,4, etc. The digits in my hand are 6,5,4,5,4,9,6,0. The highest digits I have are the 9. But how many of higher digits do I have? Let's see:\n\n- 9: 1\n- 7: 0\n- 8: 0\n- So, if I bid 4 7s, I have zero 7s, but maybe the opponent has some? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe bid a higher digit but lower quantity? Wait, the bid must be strictly higher. Since the current is 4 6s, the next could be 4 7s (same quantity but higher digit) which is valid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent's bid of 4 6s is already 4, and since I have two, maybe they have two, making total 4. So challenging would lose because it's exactly 4. But if I challenge, the total would be 4, so the bid is valid, so I lose. Hence challenging is bad here. \n\nTherefore, I need to raise the bid. The best option is to go to 4 7s. Since I have no 7s, but maybe the opponent doesn't have any either. But since I have to make a bid, maybe that's the way to go. Alternatively, increasing quantity to 5 6s. But with my two, maybe they have three? If I bid 5, then total would need to be at least 5. If they have two, total is four, so that would be a lie. But if I bid 5 6s, they might challenge. \n\nHmm. The safest raise is to go to a higher digit with the same quantity. So 4 7s, 4 8s, or 4 9s. Let's pick the highest possible digit, which is 9. So bid 4 9s. But in my hand, I have one 9. So total could be 1 plus whatever the opponent has. If they have none, then total is 1, which is less than 4. But if I bid 4 9s, and they challenge, then I lose. But maybe they won't challenge because they think I have more? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 4 7s is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is bluffing. Since they raised from my 3 6s to 4 6s, maybe they have at least one more 6. If I have two, they might have two, making total four. So challenging would be bad. Therefore, the best move is to raise to 4 7s. Since 7s are lower in count, maybe they don't have many. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a higher quantity. Let's see. The next possible bid could be 5 6s. But that requires the total to be at least five. Since I have two, the opponent would need three. Maybe possible, but risky. \n\nI think the better option is to increase the digit. So bid 4 7s. So the action would be BID: 4 7s. \n\nWait, but I have to make sure the bid is strictly higher. Since 4 7s is higher than 4 6s (same quantity, higher digit). Yes. So that's valid. \n\nTherefore, the reasoning would be that since I have two 6s, and the current bid is 4 6s, challenging might lose if the opponent has two. So better to raise to 4 7s, which is a safer bet since there are fewer 7s likely."
