Given that I hold 3 zeros, Player 1 would need at least 2 zeros in their hand to make the bid valid. Since the average distribution of zeros in 8 random digits is roughly 0.8 (about 8% chance per digit), expecting 2 or more zeros in their hand is plausible but not guaranteed. However, given the prior incremental bidding and the fact that I hold 3 zeros, it's somewhat risky to challenge now; Player 1 could very well have 2 or more zeros. To stay in the game strategically, a safe approach is to increase the bid by quantity or digit. The minimal valid raise is '5 1s', which is a higher digit with the same quantity, or '6 0s'. I will conservatively bid '5 1s' to keep options open and avoid overcommitting.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 5 1s\"\n}",
