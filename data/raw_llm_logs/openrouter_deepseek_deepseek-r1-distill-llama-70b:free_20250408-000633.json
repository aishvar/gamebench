You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. It's my turn, and the current bid is None, which means I get to start the bidding. My hand is 50921683. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at the digits I have. Let's list them out: 5, 0, 9, 2, 1, 6, 8, 3. So, each digit appears once in my hand. That means for each digit, I have exactly one. \n\nNow, since the bid history is empty, I'm the first to bid. I need to decide what to bid. The goal is to make a bid that's as low as possible but still has a good chance of being correct, so the opponent might struggle to challenge or raise me. \n\nLooking at the digits I have, the highest digit I can bid on is 9, but I only have one. The same goes for the others. So, if I bid on a higher digit like 9, I can say 1 9s, but since the opponent might also have 9s, the total could be 2 or more. But I don't know their hand, so it's risky. \n\nAlternatively, I can choose a lower digit where I have one, but maybe the opponent doesn't have any, making the total exactly 1. But if I bid 1 on a digit, the opponent could challenge if they don't have any, and I might lose. \n\nWait, but since I'm the first to bid, maybe I can bid 1 on a digit I have. That way, even if the opponent has none, the total is 1, and I win. If they have one, the total is 2, which still meets the bid. So, it's a safe starting point.\n\nLooking at my digits, the highest digit I have is 9, but I'm not sure if the opponent has any. If I bid 1 9s, and the opponent doesn't have any, I win. If they do, the total is 2, which still satisfies my bid. It's a good starting point because it's the highest digit, so it's harder for the opponent to raise me on the same digit, and they might not have a higher digit.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a lower digit like 8, but 9 is higher, so it's better to start with the highest possible to limit the opponent's options. \n\nSo, I think I'll bid 1 9s. It's a safe move because even if the opponent has one, the total is 2, which is still valid. If they don't, I still win. Plus, it's the highest digit, making it harder for them to raise on the same digit.\n"
