        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Looking at my hand, 21671287, I notice that I have two 2s and two 7s. Since the goal is to make a bid that is likely to be true but also strategic, bidding on a digit I have the most of seems like a good starting point. However, since I don't know what the other player has, I should start with a relatively conservative bid to avoid being challenged. Bidding on the 2s seems less favorable because if the other player also has 2s, it could easily exceed my bid, making it less strategic. Thus, bidding on the 7s, which I have two of, seems like a balanced choice. Considering the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and aiming to keep the bid reasonable, starting with a bid of 2 7s seems like a cautious yet engaging opening move.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 7s\"\n}",
