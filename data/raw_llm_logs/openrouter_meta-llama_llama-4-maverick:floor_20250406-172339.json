Since there are 2 players and each has 8 digits, the total count of '3's across both hands is at least 1 (the one in my hand) and at most 9 (if the other player has 8 '3's, which is highly unlikely). The current bid '1 3s' is plausible but I should consider the probability of the other player having more '3's. However, given that the bid is very low and I have one '3', I'll consider raising the bid to a slightly higher value rather than challenging immediately.\", \"action\": \"2 3s\"}",
