The current bid from Player 0 is '3 6s'. \\n\\nTo evaluate challenging: I have zero 6s. For the bid '3 6s' to be true, Player 0 must have at least three 6s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, this is not guaranteed, and Player 0 might be bluffing, especially after I bid '3 1s'. However, challenging carries risk if Player 0 does have three or more 6s.\\n\\nTo evaluate bidding higher: The next possible bids are '4 6s' (very unlikely as I have zero 6s), '3 7s', '3 8s', '3 9s', '4 0s', '4 1s', etc. \\n- Bidding on 7s, 8s, 9s, or 0s with quantity 3 requires the opponent to have a significant number of those digits.\\n- Bidding '4 1s' leverages my strong hand (three 1s). This bid requires a total of four 1s across both hands. Since I have three, it only requires Player 0 to have at least one 1 in their 8 digits. The probability of an opponent having at least one specific digit in an 8-card hand is reasonably high (1 - (0.9)^8 \u2248 57%). \\n\\nComparing options: Bidding '4 1s' is a strong, information-based bid that puts pressure on the opponent. It is statistically safer than challenging the '3 6s' bid or bidding on digits where I hold fewer cards.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 1s\"\n}\n```",
