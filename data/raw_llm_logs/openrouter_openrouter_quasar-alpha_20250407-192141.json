A good opening bid is usually conservative, reflecting a digit I have multiple times, such as 2 or 3, and assuming the opponent likely has at least one or two of the same digit. Therefore, bidding 3 twos or 3 threes could be reasonable, but starting with 2 twos or 2 threes is safer and more standard.
