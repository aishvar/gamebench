        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

The current bid is 2 5s, which means the opponent is claiming there are at least 2 fives between our hands. Since I have zero 5s, all of those would need to be in the opponent\\'s hand. This is certainly possible - they could have 2 or more 5s. I need to make a higher bid or challenge. Since I don\\'t have any 5s, I should be cautious about bidding too many of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have one 7, one 4, one 8, one 3, one 2, one 1, and one 0. I could bid 2 6s (higher digit than 5s) or 3 of a lower digit. Since I don\\'t have any 6s either, bidding 2 6s seems reasonable - it\\'s the minimal raise and doesn\\'t overcommit. If the opponent has no 6s, there are still zero 6s total, making this a risky bid. However, challenging 2 5s seems premature since the opponent could easily have 2 or more 5s in their hand.\", \"action\": \"BID: 2 6s\"}', type='text')"
