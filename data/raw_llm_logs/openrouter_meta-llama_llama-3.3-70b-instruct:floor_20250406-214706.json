        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since my hand contains no 9s but has a couple of high digits, bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity seems less likely to succeed. However, I notice that my hand has two 8s, which is a significant portion of the possible 8s. Considering the bid history started with 2 8s and jumped to 3 9s, it seems like an aggressive move. Given the information and the need to bid higher, I could consider bidding on a digit I have knowledge of, like the 8, but I need to increase the quantity or the digit value. Since I don't have enough information about the 9s or higher digits in my opponent's hand and considering the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, making an informed bid about 9s or higher digits is risky without more insight into my opponent's hand. Therefore, challenging the current bid of 3 9s seems like a reasonable strategy, especially since I have no 9s in my hand and the jump from 2 8s to 3 9s appears bold. Challenging allows me to test the validity of the bid without overcommitting based on incomplete information.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
