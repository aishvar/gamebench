        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 4 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '6 1s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 32 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.",

My hand contains one 1, so I know there are at least 4 1s in total (since Player 3 previously bid 4 1s). To make a valid higher bid, I must increase either the quantity or the digit. Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32, and given that 6 1s seems plausible but not extremely high, I should consider my own hand and the hands of others. My hand has one 1, and I could reasonably assume others might have a few 1s as well, but I also have a 5 which could potentially be used to make a higher bid. However, bidding 7 1s seems too risky without more information on other players' hands. A safer and higher bid could involve a different digit. I have one 5 and one 9, and lower digits might be more common. I will increase the quantity and digit slightly, considering my own digits and the possibility that others might have a few 5s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 7 5s\"\n}\n```",
