This bid requires at least two 5s in Player 1's hand (since 4 total 5s are needed, and I have 2). Player 1 has 8 unknown digits. The probability that a randomly chosen digit is a 5 is 0.1. The expected number of 5s in the opponent's hand is 8 * 0.1 = 0.8. The probability of the opponent having 2 or more 5s is relatively low (approximately 1 - P(0 fives) - P(1 five) = 1 - (0.9)^8 - 8*(0.1)*(0.9)^7 \u2248 1 - 0.430 - 0.383 = 0.187). While Player 1's bid of 4 5s (after I bid 3 5s and then switched to 4 4s) might suggest they hold 5s, the statistical likelihood is low. Furthermore, my hand does not support a credible higher bid. Bidding 5 5s would require three 5s from the opponent. Bidding on another digit like 4 6s (I have one 6) or 5 4s (I have two 4s) would require three 6s or three 4s from the opponent, respectively, which are also unlikely. Given the low probability of the current bid being true and the lack of a strong alternative bid based on my hand, challenging is the most strategically sound move.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
