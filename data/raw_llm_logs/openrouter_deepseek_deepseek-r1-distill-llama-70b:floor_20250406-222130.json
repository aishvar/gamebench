        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 2s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the game is between two players, each with 8 secret digits. I'm Player 1, and the current bid is 2 2s made by Player 0. My hand is 79666411. I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid.\n\nLooking at my hand, let me count the digits I have. Breaking it down: 7, 9, 6, 6, 6, 4, 1, 1. So, I have three 6s, two 1s, and one each of 7, 9, and 4. That's my composition.\n\nThe current bid is 2 2s. So, the total number of 2s across both players' hands needs to be at least 2 for this bid to be valid. Since I don't have any 2s in my hand, the opponent must have at least 2 of them. But wait, the opponent could have more, or maybe they're bluffing.\n\nI need to consider what possible bids I can make. My options are to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the current bid is 2 2s, I can bid a higher quantity of 2s, like 3 2s, but I don't have any 2s, so that might be risky. Alternatively, I can bid the same quantity but a higher digit, like 2 3s, or increase both.\n\nLooking at my digits, I have three 6s. That's a good foundation. If I bid 3 6s, that would be a higher bid because the quantity is higher than 2. Alternatively, I could bid a higher digit, like 2 7s, but I only have one 7, so that might not be as strong.\n\nWait, but the opponent might have 6s as well. If I bid 3 6s, and the opponent has, say, two 6s, then the total would be five 6s, which is more than enough. But if the opponent has none, then the total is exactly three, which meets the bid. So, it's a safe move because even if they have none, I still have three, so the bid would be valid.\n\nAlternatively, I could challenge the current bid of 2 2s. Since I have zero 2s, I'm relying on the opponent having at least two. But if they have only one or none, then challenging would make me win. However, if they have two or more, I lose. It's a bit risky because I don't know their hand, but considering that each player starts with 8 digits, having two 2s isn't too uncommon, but it's possible they're bluffing.\n\nSo, weighing the options: bidding 3 6s seems safer because I know I have three, and even if the opponent has none, the total is exactly three, which is valid. Challenging is riskier because if they have two or more 2s, I lose. On the other hand, if I challenge and they have less than two, I win. But without knowing their hand, it's a gamble.\n\nAnother thought: the opponent might be trying to set a low bid to trap me. If I challenge and lose, they win the round. But if I make a bid, I can control the game more. Since I have a strong hand with three 6s, it's better to use that to my advantage.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to bid 3 6s. It's a higher quantity than the current bid, and I have the digits to back it up. This way, I don't risk losing by challenging, and I put pressure on the opponent to either challenge me or make an even higher bid, which might be difficult for them if they don't have strong digits.\n"
