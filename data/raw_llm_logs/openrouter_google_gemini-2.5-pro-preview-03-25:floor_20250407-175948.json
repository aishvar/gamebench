For this bid to be true, Player 1 must have at least three 8s in their 8-digit hand, as I contribute none. The probability of a single player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively low (roughly 1.6 expected 8s across all 16 digits). Since I have none, the burden falls entirely on Player 1. Player 1's jump from my '2 0s' to '3 8s' is aggressive. Given the statistics and my hand composition, challenging the bid seems more likely to succeed than making a higher bid like '4 0s' (requiring two 0s from Player 1) or '3 9s' (requiring three 9s from Player 1, which is equally unlikely).\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
