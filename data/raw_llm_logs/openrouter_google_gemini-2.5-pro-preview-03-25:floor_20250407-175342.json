For the current bid to be true, Player 0 must have at least four 5s in their 8-digit hand, which is statistically possible but not highly probable. My previous bid was 3 8s, supported by the two 8s in my hand. Instead of challenging the 4 5s bid, which relies solely on Player 0 potentially bluffing or having a very specific hand, I can make a higher bid based on my own hand. Bidding 4 8s is a logical progression from my previous bid. It requires only two 8s from Player 0's hand (since I have two), which is statistically more likely than Player 0 having four 5s. This bid leverages my hand's strength and puts pressure back on Player 0.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 8s\"\n}\n```",
