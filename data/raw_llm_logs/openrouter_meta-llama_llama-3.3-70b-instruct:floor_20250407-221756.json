        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since my goal is to make a strictly higher bid or challenge, and considering I don't have any 9s to support the current bid, I should look for an opportunity to bid on a digit I have more of or challenge if the current bid seems unlikely. Given that I have three 4s and two 5s, bidding on either of these digits could be a good strategy. However, since the current bid is on 9s, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit value. Bidding on 4s or 5s directly might not be the best strategy since I don't have enough to confidently surpass the current bid in a significant way without risking an immediate challenge. Considering the digits I have, a more cautious approach might be necessary, but given the low quantity of the current bid, I might consider challenging it if I think two 9s are unlikely across both hands, or find a digit with a higher value or sufficient quantity to bid on. Since I have no 9s and the bid is low, challenging seems like a viable option, especially if I consider that the opponent might be bluffing with a low quantity bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
