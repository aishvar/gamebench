        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 1s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

However, I do have multiple occurrences of other digits. To make a valid bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have any 1s and the current bid is low, I could consider challenging, but given the rules, I should first assess if I can make a reasonable bid based on my hand. My hand contains two 7s, two 8s, two 9s, one 2, and one 5. Bidding on any of these digits with a higher quantity than 2 seems risky without knowing the other player's hand. However, considering the low current bid, I might have an opportunity to bid on a digit I have in abundance. Given that I have two 7s, which is a higher digit than 1 and matches the current quantity, I could bid on 7s, but since I need to strictly increase the bid, I must either increase the quantity or choose a higher digit. Since my highest digit with multiple occurrences is 9 and I have two of them, I can bid on 2 9s, which is a higher digit than 1s and matches the quantity, thus being a valid bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 9s\"\n}",
