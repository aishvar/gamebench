        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, I need to figure out the best move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, my hand is 47499577. Let me count each digit:\n\n- 4 appears twice.\n- 7 appears four times.\n- 9 appears twice.\n- 5 appears once.\n\nSo, my digits are 4,4,7,7,7,7,9,9,5.\n\nThe current bid is 4 6s made by Player 0. The bid history shows that Player 0 started with 2 6s, then I bid 3 7s, and now Player 0 came back with 4 6s.\n\nI need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Let's think about the possible total counts of each digit.\n\nSince each player has 8 digits, the total across both players is 16 digits. \n\nLooking at the current bid of 4 6s, I have zero 6s in my hand. So, the maximum possible 6s are the ones Player 0 might have. If they have four 6s, that's the total because I have none.\n\nBut wait, in the previous bid, I bid 3 7s. I have four 7s, so if I'm honest, there are at least four 7s. But the current bid is about 6s, which I don't have any of.\n\nPlayer 0 might be trying to bluff, thinking that I don't have many 6s. But since I have no 6s, the total can't be more than what Player 0 has. If they have four 6s, that's the total. But if they have fewer, then the total is less.\n\nBut considering the rules, a bid must be strictly higher than the previous one. The last bid was 4 6s. To bid higher, I could either increase the quantity or the digit. Since 6 is a low digit, maybe I can go higher in digit with the same quantity.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have four 7s. If I bid 4 7s, that would be a valid higher bid because the digit is higher. However, I have four 7s, so the total could be more if Player 0 also has some 7s.\n\nWait, but I need to consider the previous bid. Player 0 bid 4 6s, which is a quantity of 4 and digit 6. To make a higher bid, I can either go to 5 6s or 4 7s. Since 4 7s is higher in digit, that's a valid move.\n\nBut I have four 7s. If I bid 4 7s, and if Player 0 has none, then the total is four, which would make my bid valid. However, if Player 0 has some 7s, the total could be higher.\n\nAlternatively, I could challenge the bid. If I challenge 4 6s, and if the total is less than 4, I win. But since I have zero 6s, the total is whatever Player 0 has. If they have four, then the bid is valid, and they win. If they have fewer, then I win.\n\nConsidering that Player 0 might be trying to bluff, especially since I have a strong hand with four 7s. Maybe they're trying to distract me with the 6s bid. But I have no 6s, so challenging could be risky. If they actually have four 6s, I lose.\n\nOn the other hand, if I bid 4 7s, it's a safer move because I have four 7s, making it likely that the total is at least four. Plus, it's a higher bid than 4 6s.\n\nWait, but the current bid is 4 6s. If I bid 4 7s, that's a higher bid because the digit is higher. So that's allowed.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 5 6s, but that's risky because I don't have any 6s, and I don't know how many Player 0 has. They might have four, making 5 impossible.\n\nSo, the safer move is to bid 4 7s, leveraging the fact that I have four 7s, making it likely that the total is at least four. Plus, it's a higher bid than 4 6s.\n\nAnother consideration: the bid history. Player 0 started with 2 6s, then I went to 3 7s, and they countered with 4 6s. This might indicate that they're trying to bluff, knowing that I have some 7s. But since I have four 7s, I can confidently bid higher on 7s.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to bid 4 7s, increasing the digit from 6 to 7, which is a valid higher bid.\n"
