        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Since the digit is already 9, I cannot increase it further, so I must increase the quantity. The next possible bid is 5 0s or more reasonably, 5 1s, 5 2s, etc., but I should first check if increasing the quantity to 5 is reasonable. Given that there are 16 digits in total, bidding 5 of any digit is possible but I need to consider my hand. My hand is 12716488, which contains one 8 and no 9s. To bid 5 of a digit, I should have at least one of that digit. I have one 8 and one 1. Bidding 5 1s or 5 8s seems plausible because it is just one more than the current total count for those digits if we assume the other player has a reasonable number of them. However, since the previous bid was 4 9s, and it's unlikely that the opponent has more than one 9 (since I have none), challenging seems like a viable option. But if I choose to bid, I should bid on a digit I have or a digit that is likely to be abundant. Since I have an 8, bidding 5 8s is a reasonable choice as it is a higher bid than 4 9s and utilizes the information about my hand.\", \"action\": \"BID: 5 8s\"}",
