        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Liar's Poker game. Let's see, my hand is 48621496. Hmm, let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\nLooking at each digit: 4, 8, 6, 2, 1, 4, 9, 6. So, 4 appears twice, 6 appears twice, and the rest are single digits. The current bid is 2 5s, made by Player 0. The bid history shows that Player 0 started with 2 3s, I responded with 2 4s, and then Player 0 went to 2 5s.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. Let's think about the possible counts of 5s. Since I don't have any 5s in my hand, the only 5s could be in Player 0's hand. Player 0 has 8 digits, just like me. So, the maximum number of 5s they could have is 8, but that's unlikely because they already bid 2 3s and 2 5s. But wait, their bids don't necessarily reflect their actual hand; they could be bluffing.\n\nIf I challenge, and the total number of 5s is less than 2, I win. But if it's 2 or more, Player 0 wins. Since I have zero 5s, Player 0 would need at least 2. Do I think they have 2 or more 5s? It's possible, but given that they've bid on 3s and 5s, maybe they have some, but not too many. \n\nAlternatively, I could make a higher bid. To make a higher bid than 2 5s, I could either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 6s, maybe I can bid 2 6s. That would be a higher digit, same quantity. But wait, the current bid is 2 5s, so 2 6s is higher because 6 is higher than 5. \n\nIs 2 6s a good move? I have two 6s, so if I bid that, the total could be 2 or more. But Player 0 might have some 6s as well. Alternatively, I could go higher in quantity, like 3 of a digit I have more of. But I only have two of 4 and 6, so 3 might be risky unless I know Player 0 has at least one. \n\nChallenging might be safer because if Player 0 only has one 5, I win. But if they have two or more, I lose. Since I don't know their hand, it's a bit of a gamble. On the other hand, bidding 2 6s seems safer because I know I have two, and maybe Player 0 has none or one. \n\nI think I'll go with bidding 2 6s. It's a reasonable move because I have the cards, and it's a higher bid than the current one. Plus, it doesn't require knowing Player 0's hand beyond what I can infer.\n"
