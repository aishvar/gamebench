You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of 3 6s. My hand is 48037705. Let me check how many 6s I have here. Looking at my digits: 4, 8, 0, 3, 7, 7, 0, 5. Hmm, there are no 6s in my hand. So the opponent's bid is 3 6s. Since I have zero 6s, the opponent must have at least three 6s in their hand for the bid to be valid. But they have 8 digits as well. What's the likelihood they have three or more 6s? \n\nThe total possible digits each player has is 8, so the opponent has 8 digits. The chance of them having three 6s might not be super high, but it's possible. If I challenge now and they actually have three 6s, I lose. But if they don't, I win. Alternatively, I could bid higher. Let's think about possible bids.\n\nThe current bid is 3 6s. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity (like 4 of any digit) or keep the quantity the same but use a higher digit (like 3 7s, 3 8s, etc.). Let me check my hand again. I have two 7s, two 0s, and one each of 4, 8, 3, 5. So maybe I can bid on 7s or 0s. For example, if I bid 3 7s, that's higher than 3 6s. But I have two 7s, so the opponent would need at least one more. But wait, the total needed would be three 7s. Since I have two, they need one. That's possible. Alternatively, if I bid 4 of a lower digit, like 4 0s. I have two 0s, so they'd need two more. That's also possible. But which is more likely?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the opponent bid 3 6s, maybe they have some 6s. But since I have none, maybe they have three or more. If they have three, then the total is three, which meets their bid. But if they have four, then the total is four. So if I bid higher, like 4 6s, that's possible. But do I want to do that? But since I have zero, I can't contribute. So the opponent would need four 6s. If they have three, then the total is three, so my bid of four would be wrong, but if I challenge, I'd lose. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should challenge. Since I have zero 6s, the opponent must have at least three. The probability that they have three 6s in their 8-digit hand. Let's think about the possible combinations. There are 8 digits, each can be 0-9. The chance that exactly three are 6s is C(8,3)*(1/10)^3*(9/10)^5. That's a bit low, but not impossible. Alternatively, the opponent might be bluffing. If they have two 6s, then the total is two, which is less than three. But if I challenge, I win. But if they have three or more, I lose. So it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, if I bid higher, say 3 7s. I have two 7s, so opponent needs at least one. The chance they have one 7 is possible. Then total would be three 7s. But if I bid 3 7s, that's a higher bid. If they challenge me, then total needs to be at least three. If they have one, then total is three, which is okay. But if they have none, then total is two, so I lose. So maybe that's risky. Alternatively, bid 4 0s. I have two 0s, so opponent needs two. That's possible. But again, depends on their hand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to challenge. Because the opponent's bid is 3 6s, and I have zero. If they have three, then they're correct. But how likely is that? Let's think: in an 8-digit hand, the probability of having exactly three 6s is C(8,3)*(0.1)^3*(0.9)^5 \u2248 0.033. So about 3.3%. Plus the probability of having four or more, which is even lower. So total around maybe 4% chance. That's quite low. So the opponent is likely bluffing. Therefore, challenging might be the better option here. Because the chance that they actually have three or more 6s is low. So I should challenge.\n"
