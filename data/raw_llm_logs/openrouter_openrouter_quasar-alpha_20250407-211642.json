The current bid is 3 9s, meaning there must be at least one more 9 in Player 1's hand for the bid to be valid. Since Player 1 just raised to 3 9s, it is plausible they have at least one or two 9s themselves, making the total count of 9s likely 3 or even more. Challenging now risks losing if they indeed have one or more 9s. A safe strategy is to increase the bid conservatively. I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing to 3 0s is invalid as it does not exceed in quantity. Instead, I will raise to 3 9s \u2192 3 9s is current, so I must bid at least 4 of any digit or 3 of a higher digit (which is impossible). I will bid 4 0s, since I have two 0s and previously Player 1 did not challenge my 2 0s bid, indicating they may have some 0s as well.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 0s\"\n}",
