You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out my move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the rules: Each player has 8 secret digits, and we take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit across both hands. The current bid is None, which means I'm the first to bid. My hand is 82630814. Let me write that down: 8,2,6,3,0,8,1,4.\n\nI need to decide what to bid. Since I'm the first, I can choose any digit and quantity. The goal is to make a bid that's likely to be true but also gives me a strategic advantage. If I bid too high, someone might challenge it, and I could lose. If I bid too low, it won't be effective.\n\nLooking at my hand, I see two 8s. That's a good start. Maybe I can bid on 8s. But how many? I have two, but the total across both hands could be more. The maximum possible is 16, but realistically, it's unlikely to be that high.\n\nIf I bid 3 8s, that means I'm claiming there are at least three 8s in total. Considering I have two, the other player might have one. That seems plausible. It's a reasonable starting bid. Plus, 8 is a high digit, so if someone wants to outbid me, they'd have to either increase the quantity or choose a higher digit, which might be risky.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a lower digit with a higher quantity, but that might be less convincing. For example, 4 5s. But I don't have any 5s, so that's a guess. It's safer to bid on a digit I have.\n\nAnother thought: if I bid 3 8s, and the other player has none, the total is just two, which is less than my bid. That means if they challenge, I lose. But since I'm the first, they might not know my hand. They might think I'm bluffing or not.\n\nWait, but if I bid 3 8s, and the actual total is two, challenging would make me lose. So maybe I should bid lower. But since I'm the first, I have to set the bar. Bidding too low might not help me.\n\nHmm, maybe 3 8s is a good balance. It's a moderate bid, not too high, but still a solid claim. Plus, the digit 8 is high, so if someone wants to outbid, they have to go higher in quantity or digit.\n\nI think I'll go with BID: 3 8s. It's based on my two 8s and a reasonable assumption about the other player's hand. It gives me a chance to control the game without taking too much risk.\n"
