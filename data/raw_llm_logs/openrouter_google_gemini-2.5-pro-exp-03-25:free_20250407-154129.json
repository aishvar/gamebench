For the current bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least three 8s in their 8-digit hand. This is possible, but not highly probable for an opening bid. Challenging is a viable option. However, I can also make a higher bid. I need to bid either more than 3 of a digit, or 3 of a digit higher than 8 (i.e., 3 9s). Looking at my hand, I have two 3s. Bidding '4 3s' is a relatively safe and strong bid. For this bid to be true, the opponent only needs to have two 3s among their 8 digits, which is statistically plausible (around 25% chance for exactly two 3s, plus chances for more). Bidding '3 9s' requires the opponent to have two 9s (I have one 9). Bidding '4 3s' leverages my strongest digit count (two 3s) and requires a reasonable contribution from the opponent. It's a better option than challenging immediately, as it puts pressure back on the opponent and is based on my hand's strength.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 3s\"\n}\n```",
