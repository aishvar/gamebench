There are 16 digits in total (2 players * 8 digits). The expected number of any specific digit across all hands is 1.6 (16 * 1/10). Since I hold two 8s, bidding 'Two 8s' is a statistically reasonable and relatively safe opening bid. It reflects the composition of my hand and uses a higher digit (8) compared to 7, putting slightly more pressure on the opponent for their first bid. It forces them to bid at least 'Three Xs' or 'Two 9s'.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 8\"\n}\n```",
