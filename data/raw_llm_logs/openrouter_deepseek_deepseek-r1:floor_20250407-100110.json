You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I'm Player 0, and my hand is 87014099. So I need to make the first bid since the current bid is None. The rules say the first bid can be any valid quantity and digit, but I have to start the bidding. Let me analyze my hand first.\n\nLooking at my digits: 8,7,0,1,4,0,9,9. So let's count how many of each digit I have. \n\n0: There are two 0s here (positions 3 and 5). \n1: One 1. \n4: One 4. \n7: One 7. \n8: One 8. \n9: Two 9s. \nThe other digits (2,3,5,6) I don't have any. \n\nNow, since the total digits across both players are 16 (each has 8), the possible maximum for any digit is 16, but realistically, considering my hand, I can estimate. Since I have two 0s and two 9s, maybe those are good candidates. \n\nAs the first bid, I want to start with a bid that's not too high but also gives me some leverage. Let's think: if I bid on 0s, I have two, but the opponent could have up to 6 more (since they have 8 digits). So total possible 0s could be up to 8, but that's unlikely. Similarly for 9s. But since I have two 9s, maybe that's a safer start. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid on a digit that's in my hand but maybe less common. For example, 7: I have one, but opponent might have more. But starting with a lower quantity could be better. \n\nThe first bid needs to be a quantity and digit. Let's think of the lowest possible bid that's still reasonable. The minimum quantity is 1. But since I'm first, I can set the starting point. Maybe start with a bid that's based on my own hand but not too aggressive. \n\nFor example, since I have two 0s, maybe bid 2 0s. That's truthful in my own hand, but the opponent could have more. But if I bid 2 0s, the next player has to either bid higher quantity or same quantity with a higher digit. If they challenge, the total 0s would be at least 2 (since I have 2). So challenging that would be risky for them. Alternatively, maybe start a bit higher. \n\nAlternatively, since I have two 9s, maybe bid 2 9s. That's similar. Alternatively, since 9 is a higher digit, maybe that's better because if the opponent has to bid higher, they might have to increase the quantity or go to a higher digit. \n\nWait, the bid hierarchy: a higher quantity beats a lower one, and same quantity, higher digit. So 2 9s is higher than 2 8s, etc. \n\nSo starting with a higher digit might make it harder for the opponent to bid over without increasing the quantity. For example, if I bid 2 9s, the opponent can either bid 3 of any digit, or 2 of a higher digit. But 9 is the highest digit, so they can't go higher in digit. So they'd have to increase the quantity. \n\nBut if I bid 2 0s, the opponent can bid 2 of any digit higher than 0, like 2 1s, which would be a higher bid. So maybe starting with a higher digit is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher quantity. Let's say I have two 0s, but if I bid 3 0s, then the opponent would have to bid 4 of any digit or 3 of a higher digit. But if I have two, the opponent would need to have at least one to make it true. But since there's 8 digits in their hand, it's possible. But 3 is a low number, so maybe it's safe. \n\nWait, but the opponent's hand could have 0s, but we don't know. So when making the first bid, it's a bit of a gamble. But since I have two 0s, bidding 3 0s would mean the total needs to be at least 3. If the opponent has at least one 0, then the total is 3 or more. If they have none, then the total is 2, which would lose if challenged. \n\nBut as the first bid, I need to balance between being aggressive and cautious. Maybe start with a bid that's based on my own hand but with a slight increase. For example, since I have two 0s, bid 3 0s. That way, if the opponent has at least one, the bid is correct. But if they have none, then it's a false bid. Alternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity but a higher digit. \n\nAlternatively, looking at my hand, I have two 9s. So maybe bid 2 9s. Since 9 is a high digit, the opponent can't bid a higher digit, so they would have to increase the quantity. But if they have, say, three 9s, then the total would be five, which would make the bid valid. But if they don't have any, then the total is two, which is exactly my bid. Wait, no\u2014if I bid 2 9s, and the actual total is two, then if someone challenges, the bidder (me) wins. So if I bid 2 9s, and the total is two (my two), then challenging would lose. So that's safe. \n\nBut the opponent doesn't know that. So if I bid 2 9s, which I know is exactly the count in my hand, but the opponent might think I have more. So they might challenge, but that's risky for them. Alternatively, they might bid higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher quantity of a lower digit. For example, 3 0s. Since I have two, maybe the opponent has one. But that's uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 1 9s. That's very low, but since the minimum is 1, but as the first bid, maybe that's too easy to bid over. \n\nWait, the first bid can be any valid. So perhaps the best approach is to start with a bid that's based on the digits I have, and that's not too high but also not too low. Since I have two 9s, maybe bid 2 9s. That way, if the opponent has any 9s, the total is higher, but even if they don't, the total is 2, so the bid is valid. Because the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So if I bid 2 9s, and the total is exactly 2, then the bid is correct. So challenging would fail. \n\nTherefore, starting with 2 9s is a safe bid because I know I have two, so the total can't be less than two. Therefore, if I bid 2 9s, even if the opponent challenges, I win because the count is at least two. \n\nWait, but the opponent doesn't know my hand. So if I bid 2 9s, they might think I have one and am bluffing, leading them to challenge. But since I have two, their challenge would fail. So this is a safe bid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid higher. For example, 3 9s. But I only have two, so the opponent would need to have at least one. If they have none, the total is two, which is less than three, so if they challenge, I lose. But if they have at least one, then the bid is valid. But since there's 8 digits in their hand, the chance that they have at least one 9 is... Well, the probability depends on the distribution, but without knowing, it's a gamble. \n\nBut as the first bid, maybe it's better to start with a bid that's guaranteed to be true based on my own hand. So 2 9s is safe because I have two. So that's a solid bid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 0s. I have two 0s, same logic. But 9 is a higher digit, so bidding 2 9s is better because if the opponent wants to bid higher, they have to increase the quantity. \n\nSo the best move here is to bid 2 9s. That's a safe bid, based on my own hand, and starts the bidding at a higher digit, making it harder for the opponent to bid without increasing the quantity.\n"
