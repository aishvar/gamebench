        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 2s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the current bid is 2 2s, made by Player 0. My hand is 85376057. I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge this bid.\n\nFirst, let me look at my own digits. My hand is 8,5,3,7,6,0,5,7. So, I have two 5s, two 7s, and one each of 8,3,6,0. That means I don't have any 2s in my hand. So, the total number of 2s in both players' hands can't be more than whatever Player 0 has, since I have none.\n\nThe current bid is 2 2s. If I challenge, I need to determine if the total number of 2s is less than 2. Since I have 0, Player 0 must have at least 2 for the bid to be valid. But what's the likelihood of that?\n\nPlayer 0 might be bluffing. Maybe they have only one 2 or even none, hoping I don't challenge. But I don't have any 2s, so if they have at least two, the bid is good. If they have less than two, I win by challenging.\n\nBut wait, there are 16 digits in total (8 each). The maximum possible 2s could be up to 16, but realistically, it's much lower. The bid is 2, which is low. Maybe Player 0 is trying to set a low bar to get the game going.\n\nOn the other hand, I could try to bid higher. Since my hand has two 5s and two 7s, maybe I can bid on those. For example, I could bid 3 5s or 3 7s. But that would require the total count to be at least 3 for that digit. Alternatively, I could bid a higher digit with the same quantity, like 2 3s, but that's not higher than 2 2s because the quantity is the same but the digit is lower.\n\nWait, no. The rules say a higher bid is either a higher quantity or the same quantity but a higher digit. So, 2 3s would be a higher bid than 2 2s because 3 is higher than 2. But I don't have any 3s, so I don't know if that's a good move.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 5s, which is a higher digit than 2s. But I have two 5s, so if the total is at least 2, my bid would be valid. But since I have two, the opponent could have zero, making the total exactly two. So, 2 5s would be a safe bid because I know I have two, and the opponent might have none. That way, the total is exactly two, which matches my bid.\n\nBut wait, the current bid is 2 2s. If I bid 2 5s, that's a higher bid because 5 is higher than 2. So, that's a valid move. Alternatively, I could bid a higher quantity on a digit I have. For example, I have two 5s, so I could bid 3 5s if I think there's at least one more 5 in the opponent's hand. But I don't know that. It might be risky because if the opponent has none, the total would be two, which is less than three.\n\nSimilarly, I have two 7s. I could bid 3 7s, but again, that's risky unless I know the opponent has at least one 7.\n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the safest move is to challenge the current bid of 2 2s. Since I have zero 2s, if the opponent has less than two, I win. If they have exactly two, the bid is valid, and I lose. But given that the opponent might be trying to set a low bid, it's possible they have exactly two, but it's also possible they have one or none.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 5s, which is a higher bid. Since I have two 5s, the total would be at least two, making my bid valid. That seems like a safer move because I can control the outcome based on my own hand.\n\nWait, but if I bid 2 5s, the opponent could challenge me. If the total is exactly two (I have two, opponent has none), then my bid is valid, and I win. If the opponent has one 5, the total is three, which is still more than two, so I win. If the opponent has two or more 5s, the total is four or more, which is still valid. So, bidding 2 5s seems like a good move because I have two, and any additional 5s the opponent has just make the bid stronger.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid a higher quantity, like 3 5s, but that's riskier because the opponent might not have any 5s, making the total only two, which is less than three. So, that's a gamble.\n\nSo, considering all options, I think the best move is to bid 2 5s. It's a higher bid than 2 2s, and I can be certain that I have two 5s, making the bid at least valid if the opponent has none. Plus, it doesn't risk overbidding like going to three 5s might.\n\nAnother thought: if I challenge, and the opponent has two 2s, I lose. If they have one or none, I win. Since I don't know their hand, it's a 50-50 guess. But by bidding 2 5s, I can control the outcome better because I know my own 5s.\n\nSo, I think I'll go with bidding 2 5s. It's a safe move that's likely to be valid, and it puts the pressure back on the opponent.\n"
