        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '5 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, let me try to figure out what to do here. I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. The current bid is 5 5s, made by Player 1. I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge this bid.\n\nFirst, let's look at my hand. My digits are 5, 5, 3, 5, 9, 1, 7, 6. So, I have three 5s in my hand. That's good to know because the current bid is about 5s.\n\nThe bidding history shows that Player 0 first bid 4 5s, and then Player 1 increased it to 5 5s. So, the last bid is 5 5s.\n\nNow, I need to consider the total number of 5s in both players' hands. I have three 5s. If I assume that Player 1 has at least two 5s (since they increased the bid to 5), the total would be at least five 5s. But wait, Player 1 could be bluffing. Maybe they don't have that many 5s.\n\nBut since I have three 5s, the minimum total is three (if Player 1 has none). However, since Player 1 bid 5 5s, they might have at least two, making the total five. \n\nIf I challenge the bid, the actual count will be revealed. If the count is less than five, I win. But if it's five or more, Player 1 wins. Given that I have three 5s, the only way the total is five is if Player 1 has two. If they have one or none, the total would be four or three, which is less than five.\n\nSo, challenging might be a good move because there's a chance the total is less than five. Alternatively, I could bid higher. The next possible bid would be either increasing the quantity to 6 5s or keeping the quantity the same but increasing the digit, like 5 6s.\n\nBut if I bid 6 5s, I'm risking a lot because the total might not reach six. I only have three, so Player 1 would need at least three more. That seems unlikely unless they have a lot of 5s.\n\nAlternatively, bidding 5 6s would require that there are at least five 6s in total. But I don't have any 6s, so I don't know how many Player 1 has. It's a risky move.\n\nConsidering all this, challenging seems like a safer option. There's a good chance that the total number of 5s is less than five, especially since I only have three, and Player 1 might not have as many as they're claiming.\n\nSo, I think challenging the bid is the best move here.\n"
