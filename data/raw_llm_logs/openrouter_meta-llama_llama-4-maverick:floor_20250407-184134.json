I count the occurrences of '2' in my hand, which is 1. The total count of '2's across both hands must be at least 1 (mine) plus some from Player 0's hand. The bid of 3 2s is plausible because Player 0 could have up to 2 '2's in their hand, making the total count 3. To exceed this bid, I need to bid on a higher quantity or a higher digit. I can bid on a quantity of 3 or more with a different digit, or bid on '2' with a quantity of 4 or more. I have a total of 3 '1's in my hand. If I assume Player 0 has at least one '1', the total count of '1's could be 4, making a bid of 4 '1's reasonable. I will bid 4 '1's as it's a higher bid than 3 '2's.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 1\"\n}\n```",
