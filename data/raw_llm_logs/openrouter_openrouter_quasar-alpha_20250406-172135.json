For Player 0's bid of '2 8s' to be valid, there must be at least one more '8' in their hand. Since each player has 8 digits, and the naive player started with a conservative bid, it's plausible they have at least one '8'. The probability that they hold at least one '8' is fairly high (about 66%) given the binomial distribution (since the expected number of 8s in 8 digits is 0.8). Therefore, challenging now is risky. To raise the bid, the smallest strictly higher bid is either 3 8s or 2 of a higher digit (e.g., 2 9s). I have one '9' in my hand, so bidding 2 9s is roughly as risky as the current bid. Bidding 3 8s requires assuming there are at least two 8s in Player 0's hand, which is less probable. Overall, a conservative but strategic move is to bid 2 9s, which is a minimal raise and keeps pressure on Player 0.\",\n  \"action\": \"2 9s\"\n}",
