It is possible but somewhat unlikely they have both twos, but not impossible. Given the total of 16 digits, a bid of 2 twos is plausible, but I have no evidence to confidently increase the bid. Raising to 3 twos would be risky as I have zero. Alternatively, I could bid 2 3s, which is the same quantity but a higher digit. Checking my hand, I have zero 3s, so that would also be risky. The safest move is to challenge the current bid, suspecting Player 0 may be bluffing about having two 2s.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
