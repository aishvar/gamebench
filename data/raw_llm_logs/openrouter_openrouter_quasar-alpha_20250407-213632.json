For Player 1's bid to be valid, all three 8s must be in their hand, which is somewhat unlikely given 8 digits. The probability of exactly 3 eights in an 8-digit string is relatively low (~6-7%). Since I have none, and the bid is already at 3, this seems like a good opportunity to challenge. Bidding higher on eights without any in my hand would be risky, and raising with a different digit requires at least 4 of another digit across both hands, which is uncertain. Therefore, challenging is the strategically sound move.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
