Since each player holds 8 digits, it's plausible the opponent has one or even two nines, but not guaranteed. Given the opponent confidently raised from 2 eights to 2 nines, they likely have at least one nine. Challenging now risks losing if they do. A safe strategic play is to raise to 3 eights, since I have two eights in my hand, making a total of at least two, and I only need one more from the opponent to plausibly reach three. This is a reasonable incremental bid that pressures the opponent while remaining credible.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 8\"\n}",
