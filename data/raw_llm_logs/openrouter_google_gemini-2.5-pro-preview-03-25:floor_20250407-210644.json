With 8 unknown digits for the opponent, it's plausible they have one 7 (roughly a 57% chance assuming uniform distribution). Challenging seems risky as the bid is quite low and plausible. I should make a higher bid. My hand contains two 6s and two 8s. My previous bid was 2 6s. Player 0 bid 2 7s over that. I can bid based on my strong digits. Possible bids are 2 8s, 2 9s, 3 0s, 3 4s, 3 6s, 3 8s, etc. Bidding '2 8s' is a safe and truthful bid, as I hold two 8s. It requires zero 8s from the opponent to be true from my perspective. It minimally increases the bid (from 2 7s to 2 8s) and forces the opponent to either bid 2 9s or increase the quantity to 3. Bidding '3 6s' or '3 8s' is also possible (requiring one 6 or one 8 from the opponent, respectively), but '2 8s' is the lowest, safest increase that leverages a strength in my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 8s\"\n}\n```",
