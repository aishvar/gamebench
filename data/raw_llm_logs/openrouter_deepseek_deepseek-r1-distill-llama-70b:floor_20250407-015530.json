        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the game state. \n\nFirst, my hand is 89408791. Let me count how many of each digit I have: \n- 8 appears twice,\n- 9 appears once,\n- 4 appears once,\n- 0 appears once,\n- 7 appears once,\n- 1 appears once.\n\nSo, I have two 8s and one each of the other digits. The current bid is 2 5s by Player 0. My goal is to either make a higher bid or challenge this bid.\n\nNow, since the bid is 2 5s, I need to think about whether I can make a higher bid or if challenging is the better option. \n\nLooking at my hand, I don't have any 5s. So, I can't directly contribute to the count of 5s. But I have two 8s. The current bid is about 5s, so maybe I can bid on 8s. \n\nThe current bid is 2 5s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 8s, I could bid 2 8s, which is a higher digit than 5, so that's a valid bid. Alternatively, I could bid a higher quantity on 5s, but since I don't have any 5s, that might be risky because I don't know how many the opponent has.\n\nWait, but I have two 8s, so if I bid 2 8s, the total could be at least two. But I don't know how many 8s the opponent has. If they have more, then the bid would be valid. If not, then challenging might be better. But since I have two, I can be certain that the total is at least two, so bidding 2 8s is safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid a higher quantity on 5s, like 3 5s, but I don't have any 5s, so I'm not sure if that's a good idea. It might be a bluff, but I don't have any information about the opponent's 5s.\n\nSo, considering I have two 8s, bidding 2 8s seems like a good move because it's a higher digit than 5, and I can be certain that there are at least two 8s in the game. \n\nI should also think about the possible outcomes. If I bid 2 8s, the opponent might challenge, but since I have two, the total would be at least two, so I would win. If they don't challenge, the game continues with a higher bid. \n\nAlternatively, if I challenge the current bid of 2 5s, I'm not sure if there are at least two 5s. Since I have none, the opponent must have at least two for the bid to be valid. But I don't know that. So, challenging might be risky because if the opponent has two or more 5s, I lose. \n\nTherefore, making a bid of 2 8s seems safer and strategically better because I can back it up with my own hand, ensuring that the bid is valid.\n"
