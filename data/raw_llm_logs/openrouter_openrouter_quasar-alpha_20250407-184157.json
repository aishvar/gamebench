The current bid is 2 7s, which is plausible if Player 1 has exactly two 7s. However, since I have zero and it's somewhat unlikely Player 1 has both 7s (only a ~10% chance), challenging is a reasonable choice. Making a higher bid on 7s would be risky, and bidding on a different digit is difficult because the quantity must be at least 3 or 2 of a higher digit. I have three 2s, so bidding 3 2s is a safe and valid higher bid, exceeding the current 2 7s. This also puts pressure on Player 1, who may not have many 2s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 2s\"\n}",
