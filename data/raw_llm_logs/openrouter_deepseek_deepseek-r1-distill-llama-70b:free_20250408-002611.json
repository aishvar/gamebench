You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, the game is between me (Player 0) and another player (Player 1). Each of us has 8 secret digits. The goal is to make a bid on the total count of a specific digit across both players' hands. The bid has to be a quantity and a digit, like \"3 5s\" meaning there are at least three 5s in total. \n\nThe current bid is \"None,\" which means it's the first move. So I don't have any previous bids to consider or challenge. My hand is \"69265860,\" which I can analyze to decide what to bid.\n\nLooking at my hand: 6,9,2,6,5,8,6,0. Let me count the occurrences of each digit. \n\n- 0: 1\n- 2:1\n- 5:1\n- 6:3\n- 8:1\n- 9:1\n\nSo, I have three 6s, which is the highest count in my hand. The other digits only appear once each. Since the total number of digits is 16 (8 from each player), the maximum any digit can have is 16, but that's extremely rare and probably not the case here.\n\nSince the current bid is \"None,\" I can start by making the first bid. I need to choose a bid that's likely to be valid but also gives me an advantage. Bidding on the digit I have the most of makes sense because it increases the chances that the total count meets or exceeds my bid.\n\nI have three 6s, so I can bid \"3 6s.\" This is a safe starting point because even if the other player has zero 6s, the total would still be 3, which matches my bid. If they have one or more, then the total would be higher, making my bid valid.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider bidding a higher quantity, like 4 6s, but that would depend on the likelihood that the other player has at least one 6. Since I don't have any information about their hand, it's safer to stick with what I know. Bidding higher might risk the opponent challenging me if they don't have any 6s, which would make the total count 3, and my bid of 4 would fail.\n\nAnother option is to bid on a different digit, but since I only have one of each other digit, it's less likely to be a strong bid. For example, bidding on 9s with a quantity of 1 would probably be too low, and the opponent could easily bid higher.\n\nSo, considering all this, the best move is to bid \"3 6s.\" It's a solid starting point, and I have a good chance of being correct, which would put the pressure on the opponent to either challenge or make a higher bid.\n"
