You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to make the first bid in this game of Liar's Poker. My hand is 72728950. Let me count how many of each digit I have here.\n\nLooking at my hand: 7, 2, 7, 2, 8, 9, 5, 0. So breaking it down:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 0\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 0\n- 4: 0\n- 5: 1\n- 6: 0\n- 7: 2\n- 8: 1\n- 9: 1\n\nSince there's no current bid, I can start with any valid bid. The strategy here is to pick a digit that I have a decent number of, but also consider that the opponent has 8 digits as well. The total possible for any digit is 16 (since each player has 8 digits, 2 players total 16). But since I'm the first to bid, I need to set a bid that's not too high but also gives me some room.\n\nLooking at my digits, 2s and 7s are both two each. That's the highest count in my hand. Bidding on a higher quantity might be safer. Let's say I bid on 2s. If I bid 3 2s, that's possible because I have 2, and the opponent might have at least one. Alternatively, since I have two 7s, maybe 3 7s. But which one is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting with a higher digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, but I only have one. If I bid 2 9s, that would require the opponent to have at least one. But that's a bit risky. Maybe a safer approach is to start with a higher quantity but a lower digit. Wait, but the rules say the bid must be higher than the previous one, but since there's no previous bid, any bid is allowed. Wait no, the initial bid can be anything, but the next bid must be higher than that. So as the first player, I need to set a bid that's a good starting point.\n\nSince I have two 2s and two 7s, maybe I can pick one of those. Let's say I bid 4 2s. That would mean I'm expecting there to be at least four 2s in total. Since I have two, the opponent would need two. But is that likely? Alternatively, maybe start lower. Like 3 2s. That's three total, so opponent needs one. That's more plausible. Or 3 7s. But 3 7s would require opponent to have one. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. If I have two 7s, maybe bid 2 7s. But since the next player has to bid higher, they might have to go to 3 of a higher digit or 2 of a higher digit. Wait, no. The next bid must be higher than the current bid. So if I bid 2 7s, the next player can either bid a higher quantity (like 3 of any digit) or same quantity but higher digit (like 2 8s, 2 9s, etc.). So if I bid 2 7s, the opponent could bid 2 8s, which is higher in digit. But if I bid 3 2s, then the next player has to bid either 4 of any digit or 3 of a higher digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower digit but higher quantity. For example, 4 2s. But if I have two, opponent might not have two. Alternatively, 3 2s. Let's see, the opponent has 8 digits. The chance they have at least one 2 is somewhat reasonable. So 3 2s total (I have 2, they have 1) would make it true. But if they have none, then the total is 2, which is less than 3. So that's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a digit I have one of but is higher. Like 2 8s. Since I have one 8, the opponent needs one. That's possible. But if I bid 2 8s, the next player might challenge if they have none, but it's a 50/50 chance. \n\nWait, but as the first bid, I need to set a bid that's plausible but also doesn't reveal too much. Maybe starting with a mid-range digit and a moderate quantity. Since I have two 7s, which is a higher digit, maybe bid 3 7s. That would require the opponent to have at least one 7. If they have one, total is three. If they have none, then the bid is wrong. But since there are 16 digits in total, the probability of them having at least one 7 is... Well, each digit in their hand is a 0-9, so the chance that any particular digit is present in their 8 digits is 1 - (9/10)^8, which is roughly 1 - 0.43 = 0.57. So about 57% chance they have at least one 7. So maybe that's a reasonable gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 2 9s. I have one, so they need one. But 9 is a higher digit, so if the opponent has to bid higher, they might have to go higher. But again, it's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, consider the total possible. Since the maximum is 16, but starting with something like 4 of a digit. Let's say I bid 4 2s. I have 2, so opponent needs 2. Possible, but not certain. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to start with a bid that's based on the highest count in my hand. I have two 2s and two 7s. Bidding 3 2s or 3 7s. Let's compare. If I bid 3 2s, the opponent can challenge, but if they have at least one, it's valid. Alternatively, 3 7s. Which is better? 7 is a higher digit than 2. So if I bid 3 7s, the next player can either bid higher quantity (4 of any digit) or same quantity but higher digit (3 8s, 3 9s). But since 7 is higher than 2, maybe starting with a higher digit is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 8s. I have one, so opponent needs one. But 8 is higher. \n\nWait, but the first bid can be anything. So perhaps start with a bid that's a bit aggressive but not too much. Let me think again. My hand has two 2s, two 7s, one 8, one 9, one 5, one 0. So the highest counts are 2s and 7s. Bidding 3 7s would require opponent to have at least one. If they have one, total is three. If they have none, then the bid is false. But if I bid 3 7s, and they challenge, I lose. But if they don't challenge, then they have to bid higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity but higher digit. For example, 2 9s. Since I have one, opponent needs one. But 9 is higher than 7 or 2. So the next player would have to bid higher than 2 9s, which would be 3 of any digit or 2 of a higher digit (but 9 is the highest, so they can't go higher in digit, so they have to increase quantity). That might force them to bid 3 of something. \n\nBut if I bid 2 9s, and they have none, then the total is 1, which is less than 2, so if they challenge, I lose. But if they don't challenge, they have to bid higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a middle ground. Let's say 3 5s. I have one 5. The opponent would need two. But that's possible. \n\nHmm. I think the best approach is to start with a bid that's based on the highest count in my hand. Since I have two 2s and two 7s, maybe bid 3 7s. That way, if the opponent has at least one 7, the bid is valid. Given that there's a decent chance they have at least one, this seems reasonable. Alternatively, 3 2s. But 7 is a higher digit, which might be better strategically because it forces the next player to bid higher in quantity or a higher digit. \n\nAnother angle: the total number of digits in the game is 16. So the maximum possible for any digit is 16. But starting with a bid that's 3 of a digit is safe if I think there's a good chance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 4 0s. I have one 0. The opponent would need three 0s. That's possible but less likely. \n\nWait, but the first bid is about setting the tone. If I start with a higher quantity, the opponent may have to bid higher, but if I start with a lower quantity but higher digit, they might have to increase quantity. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps start with 2 7s. Then the opponent can bid 2 8s, 2 9s, or 3 of any digit. But since I have two 7s, and maybe the opponent has one, that's three total. So 2 7s is safe. But the problem is that the current bid is None, so any bid is allowed. So I need to choose the best starting bid. \n\nWait, but in the example given, the first bid was 3 5s. The reasoning was based on the player's hand. So maybe the best approach is to start with a quantity that's one more than what I have. For example, I have two 7s, so bid 3 7s. That way, I'm accounting for the possibility that the opponent has at least one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity but a higher digit. For example, 2 8s. I have one, so the opponent needs one. That's possible. \n\nBut considering that the opponent has 8 digits, the probability of them having at least one of a particular digit is about 57% (as calculated earlier). So if I bid 3 7s, there's a 57% chance they have at least one. That's a reasonable gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 7s. Since I have two, even if the opponent has none, the total is two, which meets the bid. Wait, no. If the bid is 2 7s, and the total is two (my two), then it's valid. But if I have two, the total could be two, so bidding 2 7s is safe. Wait, but the initial bid can be anything. So why not bid exactly what I have? Because then the opponent can challenge, and if the total is exactly two (if they have none), then I win. Wait, no. If I bid 2 7s and the actual total is two (my two), then the bid is valid (since 2 >= 2). So if I bid 2 7s, it's a guaranteed valid bid, because even if the opponent has none, I have two. Wait, no. Wait, the bid is the total across all players. So if I have two 7s and the opponent has none, the total is two. So if I bid 2 7s, then when challenged, the total is two, which meets the bid. So that's a safe bid. Oh! That's a good point. So if I bid the exact number I have, then even if the opponent has none, the bid is still valid. Because the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So for example, if I have two 7s, and I bid 2 7s, then even if the opponent has zero, the total is two, which meets the bid. Therefore, that's a safe bid. \n\nWait, that's a key insight. So if I have two 7s, bidding 2 7s is always safe. Because the total can't be less than two. Because I have two. So even if the opponent has none, the total is two, which satisfies the bid. Therefore, the safest initial bid is to bid the number of a digit you have, because that ensures that the bid is at least correct. \n\nBut wait, the rules say: \"If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\" So if I bid 2 7s, and the actual count is two (I have two, opponent has zero), then I win. So that's a safe bid. \n\nSo why not start with that? For example, if I have two 7s, bid 2 7s. That's a guaranteed valid bid. Then the opponent has to either bid higher (either higher quantity or same quantity with higher digit). \n\nSo in my case, my hand is 72728950. So I have two 7s, two 2s, one 8, one 9, one 5, one 0. \n\nIf I bid 2 7s, that's safe. Then the opponent has to bid higher. They could bid 3 of any digit, or 2 of a higher digit (like 2 8s, 2 9s). \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 2s. Since I have two 2s, that's also safe. But 2 is a lower digit than 7. So if I bid 2 2s, the opponent can bid 2 3s, 2 4s, etc., up to 2 9s, or bid 3 of any digit. \n\nBut which is better: bidding on a higher digit with the same quantity or the same quantity with a lower digit. \n\nIf I bid 2 7s, then the opponent can bid 2 8s, 2 9s, or higher quantity. If they bid 2 9s, then I can challenge if I think they don't have any 9s. But since I have one 9, the total would be at least one. If they bid 2 9s, the total would need at least two. If I have one, they need at least one. So if they bid 2 9s, and I have one, the opponent must have at least one. But that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 2s, opponent could bid 2 3s, which I have none of. But they might have some. \n\nBut starting with a higher digit might be better because it forces the opponent to bid higher in quantity if they want to continue. For example, if I bid 2 9s (since I have one), the total is at least one. But if I bid 2 9s, and the opponent challenges, then the total would be at least one (my one), but the bid is 2. So 1 < 2, so I lose. Therefore, bidding 2 9s is risky because it's possible that the opponent has none. \n\nBut if I bid 2 7s, which I have two of, then the total is at least two. So even if the opponent has none, the bid is valid. Therefore, bidding the number of a digit I have is safe. \n\nSo the safest initial bid is to bid the exact count of a digit I have. So in my case, I have two 7s, two 2s, one 8, one 9, one 5, one 0. \n\nSo I can choose to bid 2 7s or 2 2s. Since 7 is a higher digit, bidding 2 7s would be better because it's a higher digit, making it harder for the opponent to bid a higher digit with the same quantity. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 2s. Since I have two 2s, the opponent needs at least one. If they have one, total is three. But if they don't, total is two, which is less than three, so if they challenge, I lose. But if I bid 2 7s, it's safe. \n\nSo the safest move is to bid 2 7s. That way, even if the opponent challenges, the total is at least two (my two), so I win. \n\nTherefore, the action should be to bid 2 7s.\n"
