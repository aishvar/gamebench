        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 7s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, let's see. I'm playing Liar's Poker, and I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of \"2 7s.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at my hand, which is 86493150. Let me count how many of each digit I have. Breaking it down: 8, 6, 4, 9, 3, 1, 5, 0. So, each digit appears once except for any duplicates, which I don't see here. That means I have one of each digit from 0 to 9 except for 2 and 7. \n\nWait, specifically, I don't have any 2s or 7s in my hand. So, for the digit 7, I have zero. Since the current bid is 2 7s, that means the total number of 7s between both players needs to be at least 2. But I have none, so the other player must have at least 2 7s for the bid to be valid. \n\nNow, considering the maximum possible, each player has 8 digits, so the maximum number of 7s the other player could have is 8. But the current bid is only 2, which seems low. Maybe the other player is trying to start with a low bid to trick me. \n\nI have to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. If I challenge, and the total 7s are less than 2, I win. But if it's 2 or more, I lose. Since I have zero, the other player needs at least 2. The likelihood of them having exactly 2 is possible, but it's also possible they have more. \n\nOn the other hand, if I bid higher, I need to bid either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. The current bid is 2 7s. So, I could bid 3 of a higher digit. Looking at my hand, I have an 8, which is a high digit. Maybe I can bid 3 8s. But wait, I only have one 8, so the other player would need to have at least 2 more for the total to be 3. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 of a higher digit than 7, like 8s. Since my bid would be 2 8s, which is higher than 2 7s because 8 is a higher digit. That might be a safer move because I have one 8, and the other player might not have many. \n\nBut if I bid 2 8s and the other player has, say, two 8s, then the total would be 3, which is more than my bid, so I would win. If they have one or none, then my bid would be valid as well. \n\nAlternatively, I could challenge the current bid. If I think the other player doesn't have enough 7s, I can challenge. But since I don't know their hand, it's a bit risky. \n\nConsidering the options, bidding 2 8s seems safer because I have one 8, and it's a higher digit than 7, making my bid valid. Plus, it's a low quantity, so it's more likely to be correct. \n\nWait, but the current bid is 2 7s. If I bid 2 8s, that's a higher bid because 8 is higher than 7. So, it's a valid move. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 of a lower digit, but I don't have enough in my hand to feel confident. For example, I have one 6, one 5, etc. So, bidding higher on those might not be wise. \n\nSo, the best move is to bid 2 8s, leveraging my single 8 and the higher digit to make a safe bid.\n"
