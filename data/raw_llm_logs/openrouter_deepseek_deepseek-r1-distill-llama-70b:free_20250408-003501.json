You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn to make a bid. The game just started, and there's no current bid, so I need to make the first move. My hand is 5, 3, 7, 8, 7, 1, 5, 0. Let me analyze this.\n\nFirst, I should count how many of each digit I have. Let's list them out: 5 appears twice, 7 appears twice, 3, 8, 1, and 0 each appear once. So the digits I have are 0,1,3,5,5,7,7,8.\n\nSince I'm the first to bid, I can choose any digit and any quantity. My goal is to make a bid that's likely to be true but not too obvious, so the opponent might doubt it but it's actually correct. Alternatively, I can make a bid that's a bit of a stretch to try to bluff, but since it's the first bid, a reasonable bid is probably better.\n\nLooking at my digits, I have two 5s and two 7s. That's a good starting point. The maximum possible for any digit is 16, but since there are only two players, each with 8 digits, the maximum any digit can have is 16. But realistically, the counts will be much lower.\n\nI should consider what digits are common. For example, 0s are less common in some cases, but in this hand, I have one. 1s, 3s, 5s, 7s, 8s. Since I have two 5s and two 7s, maybe I can bid on one of those.\n\nIf I bid on 5s, I can say at least two 5s. But since the opponent might have none, one, or more, it's possible. Alternatively, I could bid on 7s. But I'm thinking, what's the safest bet?\n\nWait, but since I have two 5s, if I bid 2 5s, that's a safe bet because I know there are at least two. The opponent might have more, but I can't be sure. Alternatively, I could bid higher, like 3 5s, but that's riskier because the opponent might not have any.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for a digit that's less likely to be challenged. For example, 0s are less common, but I only have one. So maybe not the best choice. 1s, I have one, so that's risky. 3s, same thing. 8s, only one.\n\nSo between 5s and 7s, both have two in my hand. Maybe I should pick one and bid 2 of that digit. Since the opponent doesn't know my hand, they have to guess. If I bid 2 5s, that's a solid bid because I have two, and the opponent might have zero, one, or two. The total could be 2, 3, or 4. So it's a safe bet.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 7s. Same logic. But I think 5s might be a bit more common than 7s, so maybe the opponent is less likely to have 5s. Or maybe not. It's hard to say.\n\nAnother approach: think about the total possible. Since there are 16 digits in play, and I have 8, the opponent has 8. So if I have two 5s, the opponent could have 0-6 more. So the total could be 2-8. But the maximum is 16, but that's across all digits. Wait, no, the maximum for a specific digit is 16, but that's only if all 16 digits are the same, which is impossible because each player has 8 unique digits? Wait, no, in Liar's Poker, each player has 8 digits, but they can have duplicates. Wait, no, in the standard game, each player has 8 cards, each with a digit, and duplicates are allowed because it's possible. So the total number of a specific digit can be up to 16 if all players have that digit.\n\nBut in this case, my hand has two 5s. So the opponent could have 0 to 8 5s. So the total could be 2 to 10. But that's a wide range. So if I bid 2 5s, it's definitely true, but maybe I can bid higher.\n\nWait, but if I bid 3 5s, the opponent might have one or more, making the total 3 or more. But if the opponent has zero, then the total is 2, and I lose. So it's risky. So maybe it's safer to bid 2 5s.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I have only one of, like 3, and bid 1 3s. But that's too low, and the opponent might challenge it because it's easy to have at least one. Or maybe not, because if they don't have any, they might challenge.\n\nWait, but the first bid can be any quantity and digit. So I need to choose a digit and a quantity that's likely to be correct, but not too obvious. Since I have two 5s, I can safely bid 2 5s. It's a solid starting point.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid a higher quantity on a digit I have more of, but I don't have more than two of any digit. So 2 is the maximum I can safely bid without risking a challenge.\n\nSo, I think I'll bid 2 5s. That's a safe and reasonable starting bid. It's not too high, and I know it's at least correct because I have two. The opponent might have more, but even if they don't, the bid is still valid.\n"
