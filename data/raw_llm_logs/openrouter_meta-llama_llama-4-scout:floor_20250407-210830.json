Given my hand is '20433791', I count a total of 3 threes. The maximum possible quantity for any digit across both players' hands is 16. Since Player 1 bid '2 3s', they are claiming there are at least 2 threes in total. With 3 threes in my hand, if Player 1 has no threes, the total would be 3, which already exceeds their bid. However, I don't know Player 1's hand. A safe move would be to bid higher than '2 3s' if I can. I can bid '3 3s' as it's possible there are indeed 3 threes in total (all in my hand). This bid exceeds the current bid by quantity.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: Q D\"\n}\n```",
