        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 7s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Looking at my hand, 94835297, I notice I have one 7 and one 9, but no 8s. Since the bid is about 7s and I only have one, I must consider the likelihood of the other player having at least three 7s to meet or exceed the bid of 4 7s. Considering the bidding history, the bids have been steadily increasing in either quantity or digit value, suggesting a cautious and strategic approach from both players. However, without more 7s in my hand and given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, bidding higher than 4 7s seems risky. Challenging seems like a viable option because if the total number of 7s is less than 4, I win. Given the information and the strategic play so far, challenging the current bid of 4 7s appears to be the most prudent move, as it forces a reveal and could give me an advantage if the bid is unlikely.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
