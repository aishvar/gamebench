To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one '8', bidding higher on '8' is not possible for me. I should look for a digit that appears more than twice in my hand and bid on that if possible. In my hand, the digit '0' appears twice, which is more than the current bid of '2 8s'. I can make a bid on '0' with a quantity of '2' or higher if I have it. However, I don't want to challenge without a strong reason, and I have a chance to make a higher bid. The digit '1' appears twice as well. Given that I have two '1's and two '0's, I can make a bid of '2 0s' or '2 1s'. Between these, '2 1s' seems like a reasonable next bid because '1' is higher than '8' is not true but having two of them makes it a potential bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 1s\"\n}\n```",
