For this bid to be true, there must be at least three 3s across both hands (16 digits total). Since I have no 3s, Player 0 must have at least three 3s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively low (around 3.8%). Player 0 previously bid '2 3s', I bid '2 5s', and they immediately raised to '3 3s'. This could indicate they have two 3s and are bluffing the third, hoping I have one or won't challenge. Given I have zero 3s, the burden of proof is entirely on Player 0's hand, making the bid statistically unlikely. Therefore, challenging is the most logical move.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
