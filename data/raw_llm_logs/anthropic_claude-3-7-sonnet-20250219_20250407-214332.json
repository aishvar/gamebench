Since I have 0 8s, this means Player 0 must have at least 2 8s in their hand for this bid to be valid. This is entirely possible since each player has 8 digits, and Player 0 could easily have 2 or more 8s. Rather than challenging, I should make a higher bid. I can either bid more 8s or switch to a higher digit (9). Looking at my hand, I have one 9, so bidding \\'2 9s\\' would be reasonable as it only requires Player 0 to have 1 more 9 to be valid.\",\\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 9\"\\n}\\n```', type='text')"
