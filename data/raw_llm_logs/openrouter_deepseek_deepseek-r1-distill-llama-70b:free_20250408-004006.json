You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and I need to decide whether to bid or challenge. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the game state. My hand is 67706754. That means I have the digits 6, 7, 7, 0, 6, 7, 5, 4. So, counting them up: 6 appears twice, 7 appears three times, and 0, 5, 4 once each. \n\nThe current bid is 4 1s, made by Player 0. The bid history shows that Player 0 started with 2 1s, I responded with 3 7s, and then Player 0 upped it to 4 1s. Now it's my turn again.\n\nI need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. Let's consider each option.\n\nIf I challenge, we'll both reveal our digits, and if the total number of 1s is less than 4, I win. But if it's 4 or more, Player 0 wins. So, I need to assess how likely it is that there are at least 4 1s in total.\n\nLooking at my hand, I don't have any 1s. So, all the 1s must be in Player 0's hand. Since each player has 8 digits, the maximum number of 1s Player 0 could have is 8. But how many are likely?\n\nPlayer 0's first bid was 2 1s, which I countered with 3 7s. Then Player 0 went to 4 1s. That suggests they might have a few 1s, maybe 4, but it's possible they're bluffing.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to make a higher bid. To do that, I need to bid either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. The current bid is 4 1s. So, I could bid 4 of a higher digit, like 4 2s, 4 3s, etc., or increase the quantity beyond 4 on 1s, but that's not possible since 4 is the current quantity, and I can't go lower.\n\nWait, no. The next higher bid after 4 1s would be either a higher quantity (like 5 1s) or the same quantity with a higher digit (like 4 2s, 4 3s, etc.). But considering the digits I have, maybe I can make a bid based on my own digits.\n\nIn my hand, I have three 7s. So, I could consider bidding 4 7s, which is higher than 4 1s because 7 is a higher digit. That might be a good move because I know I have three 7s, and if Player 0 has at least one more 7, the bid would hold. But I don't know their hand, so it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 5 of a lower digit, but I don't have enough of any digit except 7. I have three 7s, so I can't bid 5 7s. So, 4 7s seems plausible.\n\nAnother option is to challenge. Since I don't have any 1s, if Player 0 has exactly 4, the bid is valid. But if they have less, I win. However, Player 0 might be trying to bluff, thinking I don't have 1s. But since they increased the bid from 2 to 4, maybe they have at least 4.\n\nSo, weighing the options: challenging could be risky if they actually have 4 1s. Bidding 4 7s is safer because I have three, and it's possible Player 0 has at least one more 7. Plus, even if they don't, challenging that bid later might be tricky.\n\nTherefore, I think the best move is to bid 4 7s. It's a higher digit than 1s, so it's a valid bid, and I have a good chance of it being correct.\n"
