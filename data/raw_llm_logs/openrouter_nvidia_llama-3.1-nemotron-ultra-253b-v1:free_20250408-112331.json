You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

My digits are 7,7,6,6,9,1,5,4. So, in my own hand, there's one 4. The total possible 4s would be my 1 plus whatever the opponent has. Since each player has 8 digits, the maximum possible 4s they could have is 8, but that's unlikely. But the current bid is 2, so the total needs to be at least 2. Since I have 1, the opponent would need at least 1 more. But maybe they have none. Wait, but the bid is 2 4s. If I challenge, and the total is less than 2, I win. But if it's 2 or more, I lose.\n\nBut challenging now might be risky because if the opponent has at least one 4, then the total is 2, which meets the bid. So maybe challenging isn't safe here. Alternatively, I can make a higher bid. Let's think about possible bids. The current bid is 2 4s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity but higher digit.\n\nLooking at my hand, what digits do I have multiple of? I have two 7s, two 6s. So maybe I can bid on 7s or 6s. Let's see. If I bid 3 7s, for example. Do I think there are at least 3 7s in total? I have two 7s. The opponent could have one or more. But since they have 8 digits, maybe they have one 7. Then total would be 3. That's possible. Alternatively, maybe they have none. So 3 7s might be a bluff. Alternatively, if I bid 3 6s. I have two 6s. If the opponent has one, that's three. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a higher digit. For example, 2 5s. Wait, the current bid is 2 4s. So to make a higher bid with the same quantity, the digit has to be higher than 4. So 2 5s, 2 6s, etc. But 2 5s would require that the total number of 5s is at least 2. I have one 5 in my hand. So the opponent needs at least one 5. If they have one, then total is 2. But if they don't, then it's only 1. So that's risky. But if I bid 2 5s, it's a minimal increase. Alternatively, maybe go for a higher quantity. Like 3 5s. But that's even riskier because I only have one. Unless the opponent has two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bid on 7s. Since I have two, maybe 3 7s. If the opponent has one, that's three. But if they have none, then it's two. So the bid would be invalid. But maybe the opponent is likely to have at least one 7. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a higher digit. Let's see. If I bid 2 7s. Wait, the current bid is 2 4s. So 2 7s is higher because the digit is higher. That's a valid bid. So 2 7s. Then the total needs to be at least 2. I have two 7s. So even if the opponent has zero, the total is 2, which meets the bid. So that's a safe bid. Because I can guarantee that there are at least two 7s. So bidding 2 7s would be a sure thing, right? Because I have two, so regardless of the opponent's hand, the total is at least two. So that's a safe move. That way, the opponent can't challenge because they know that the bid is valid. So maybe that's the best move here. Because it's a certain bid, so the opponent would have to either make a higher bid or challenge. But since the bid is certain, challenging would make them lose. So they would probably choose to make a higher bid instead. So in this case, making a bid of 2 7s is a safe and logical move. That way, I can force the opponent into a position where they have to bid higher, and since I know there are two 7s, I can control the bidding. Alternatively, maybe even go higher. Like 3 7s. But that's riskier. Because if the opponent has none, then total is two, which is less than three. So if I bid 3 7s, and they challenge, I would lose. But if I bid 2 7s, it's safe. So the safest move is to bid 2 7s. That's a minimal increase in digit, but same quantity, which is allowed. So the action would be BID: 2 7s. The reasoning is that since I have two 7s, the total is at least two, so the bid is safe and forces the opponent to either challenge (which they can't) or make a higher bid.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 7s in my hand, guaranteeing at least two 7s in total. Bidding '2 7s' is a safe move as it's certain to be valid, leveraging my known cards to force the opponent into a higher bid or a losing challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 7s\"\n}",
