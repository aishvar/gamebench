You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to make the first bid in this game of Liar's Poker. My hand is 54009314. Let me count how many of each digit I have.\n\nLooking at my digits: 5, 4, 0, 0, 9, 3, 1, 4. So, breaking that down:\n\n- 0: 2\n- 1: 1\n- 3: 1\n- 4: 2\n- 5: 1\n- 9: 1\n\nThe other digits (2, 6, 7, 8) I don't have any. Since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total number of digits in play is 16. The current bid is None, so I have to start the bidding.\n\nI should choose a bid that's a reasonable starting point. Typically, players start with a bid that's based on their own hand but leaves room for the opponent to have some as well. Since I have two 0s and two 4s, maybe start with one of those. Let's think: if I bid 2 0s, that's exactly what I have. But the opponent could have more, so maybe that's a safe starting bid. However, the first bid needs to be a quantity and digit. Alternatively, maybe a lower quantity but a higher digit. Wait, no\u2014the first bid can be any valid bid, but since there's no previous bid, I just need to start.\n\nWait, the rules say the first bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'. But since there's no current bid, I can start with any bid. Wait, no\u2014the rules say \"Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" How does that work? Because 'None' is considered the starting point. So, perhaps any bid is allowed as the first move. Because there's no prior bid, the first player can bid anything. But maybe the system requires that the first bid is at least 1 of any digit. So, for example, the first bid could be '1 0s' or '2 5s', etc.\n\nGiven that, I need to make a bid that I think is possible, considering my hand. Let's see: I have two 0s and two 4s. Let's consider the digits. If I bid 2 0s, that's exactly what I have. The opponent could have 0, 1, or more. The total would then be between 2 and, say, maybe 6 (if they have 4 0s, but since each player has 8 digits, the maximum possible for a digit is 8 in each hand, but that's unlikely). Wait, no, each player has 8 digits, so total possible for any digit is 16 (if both players have all 8 digits the same). But that's extremely rare. Realistically, the opponent might have 0 or a few of the same digit.\n\nSo, if I bid 2 0s, the total could be 2 (if opponent has none) up to, say, maybe 4 or 5. But I have 2, so if I bid 2, the opponent might challenge if they have none, but if they have even one, the total is 3, which is higher than 2. Wait, no\u2014if I bid 2 0s, and the total is 2, then the challenger would lose. But if the total is 3 or more, the bid stands. So bidding 2 0s is risky because if the opponent has none, the total is exactly 2, which meets the bid (so challenger would lose). Wait, no: the challenge is only if the bid is higher than the actual count. If the bid is exactly the count, the bidder wins. So if I bid 2 0s and the total is exactly 2, then if someone challenges, I win. So bidding 2 0s is safe as long as the total is at least 2, which it is because I have 2. But the opponent might have more, so the actual total is at least 2. Therefore, bidding 2 0s is a safe opening bid. But maybe I can start a bit lower to force the opponent to bid higher. Wait, but the first bid can't be lower than 'None'\u2014so any bid is allowed. Wait, no, the rules say the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'. But since 'None' is the starting point, perhaps any bid is allowed. Maybe the 'strictly higher' applies when there's a previous bid. So the first bid can be any quantity and digit. So I can start with 1 0s, for example.\n\nBut given that I have two 0s, maybe starting with 2 0s is better. Alternatively, maybe a higher digit. For example, if I bid 1 9s, since I have one 9. The opponent might have none, making the total 1, which meets the bid, so if they challenge, I win. Or they might have more, but it's possible. Alternatively, maybe 2 4s, since I have two 4s. But that's similar to the 0s.\n\nAlternatively, start with a lower quantity but higher digit. For example, 1 5s. I have one 5. The opponent could have none, making the total 1. If I bid 1 5s, then if they challenge, the total is 1, which meets the bid, so I win. But if they bid higher, like 2 5s, they need to have at least one more. But maybe starting with a lower quantity but higher digit is safer. Wait, but the next bidder has to either bid higher quantity or same quantity with higher digit. So if I start with 1 5s, the next player could bid 1 6s, 1 7s, etc., up to 1 9s, or 2 of any digit.\n\nAlternatively, starting with a higher quantity on a lower digit. Like 2 0s. Then the next player has to bid higher than that. They could bid 3 of any digit, or 2 of a higher digit (like 2 1s, 2 2s, etc., up to 2 9s). But since I have two 0s, maybe that's a good start.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a middle digit. For example, 2 4s. I have two 4s. The opponent could have some, making the total higher. But if they don't, the total is 2, so my bid is exactly correct. So if they challenge, I win. If they bid higher, they have to go to 3 of any digit or 2 of a higher digit.\n\nAlternatively, consider the digits that are less likely for the opponent to have many of. For example, 9s. I have one 9. If I bid 1 9s, then the opponent could have 0 or more. If they have none, the total is 1, which meets the bid. If they have one, total is 2. So if I bid 1 9s, it's safe. Then the opponent has to bid higher. They might challenge if they have none, but if they have even one, they might bid higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher quantity on a lower digit. Like 3 0s. I have two, so opponent needs to have at least one. If they have one, total is 3, which meets the bid. If they have none, total is 2, which is less than 3, so if they challenge, I lose. So that's risky. But if I bid 3 0s, and the opponent has none, they might challenge, and I lose. So maybe that's too aggressive.\n\nSo perhaps starting with a bid that's exactly the number I have. For example, 2 0s. Then, the opponent knows that at least two 0s are present. If they have any, they might bid higher. If they have none, they might challenge. But since I have two, the total is at least two, so if they challenge, they lose. Wait, no: if I bid 2 0s, and the total is exactly 2 (if they have none), then the count is 2, which meets the bid (since the bid is 2 or more). Wait, no: the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So if the bid is 2 0s, then if the actual count is 2, the bid is correct. So if the opponent challenges, they lose because the count is equal to the bid. Therefore, bidding 2 0s is safe because even if the opponent has none, the total is 2, which meets the bid. Therefore, I can safely bid 2 0s. The opponent can't challenge successfully unless the total is less than 2, which it can't be because I have 2.\n\nTherefore, starting with 2 0s is a safe bid. Alternatively, I could bid 2 4s, which is also safe. Or 1 9s. But 2 0s is better because it's a higher quantity. Since higher quantity is better in terms of forcing the opponent to bid higher. For example, if I bid 2 0s, the next player has to bid either 3 of any digit or 2 of a higher digit. If I bid 1 9s, they can bid 1 of a higher digit (but there's none higher than 9), so they have to bid 2 of any digit. So starting with a higher quantity might be better to put pressure on the opponent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 4s. I have two 4s, so the total is at least two. The opponent might have some. But same logic applies. So which is better? 0 is a lower digit, so if I bid 2 0s, the next player could bid 2 1s, 2 2s, etc., up to 2 9s, or 3 of any digit. Whereas 2 4s would require the next bid to be 3 of any digit or 2 5s and up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, 2 9s. But I only have one 9. So if I bid 2 9s, the total could be 1 (if opponent has none) or more. If the opponent has none, the total is 1, which is less than 2, so if they challenge, I lose. That's risky. So better to bid based on what I have.\n\nSo safest bids are 2 0s, 2 4s, or 1 of the digits I have. Bidding 2 0s is better because it's a higher quantity, which is more aggressive. Let's go with that.\n"
