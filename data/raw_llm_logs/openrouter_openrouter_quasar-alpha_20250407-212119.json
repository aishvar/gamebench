Having two 9s myself, it's quite likely that at least one more exists in Player 1's hand, making 3 nines a reasonable bid. Therefore, challenging now would be risky. The next valid higher bid would be either 4 of any digit or 3 of a digit higher than 9, but since 9 is the highest digit, only the quantity can be increased. I will raise the bid to 4 9s, which is still plausible given the distribution.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 9\"\n}",
