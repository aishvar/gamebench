        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 0s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Given my hand 19823537, I notice I have one 0, but to determine the best move, I must consider the likelihood of there being at least four 0s in total between both players' hands. Since I only have one 0, I need to assess if bidding higher or challenging is more strategic. Bidding on a digit I have more of seems safer, but since the current bid is on 0s and I only have one, I should consider the distribution of other digits. However, without specific information on the opponent's hand, challenging seems risky unless the bid is obviously too high. Given that 4 is not an excessively high number for any digit considering there are 16 digits in play, and without clear evidence that the current bid is too high, making a bid on a digit I have more of or seems plausible could be a good strategy. I have multiple instances of other digits, but since the bid needs to be strictly higher, I must either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit if the quantities are the same. Since my hand contains two 3s and the bid history shows a bid of 3 3s, which was surpassed by 4 0s, and considering I don't have enough information to safely challenge the 4 0s bid, I should look for a digit that could reasonably have a higher count or the same count but is a higher digit. Given these considerations and the need to make a strictly higher bid, bidding on a digit that I have a good number of or seems likely to exist in sufficient quantity is necessary.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 3s\"\n}",
