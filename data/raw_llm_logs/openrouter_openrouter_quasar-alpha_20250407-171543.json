Since I have zero 7s, for the bid to be valid, Player 0 must have both 7s in their hand, which is possible but somewhat unlikely given random distribution. Given that 7s are relatively rare in my hand (none), and the bid is modest (only 2), it's risky to challenge now. Instead, I will make a minimal higher bid to maintain pressure and gather more information. The next valid bid must be at least 2 8s or 3 of any digit. I have two 9s, so bidding 2 9s is safe and minimal.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 9\"\n}",
