You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, let's see. I need to figure out the best move here in Liar's Poker. My hand is 58181696. Let me count how many of each digit I have.\n\nBreaking down my hand: 5, 8, 1, 8, 1, 6, 9, 6. So, let's tally them up:\n\n- 1s: 2\n- 5s: 1\n- 6s: 2\n- 8s: 2\n- 9s: 1\n\nNo 7s in my hand. The current bid is 2 7s from Player 0. Since I have zero 7s, the opponent must have at least two 7s in their hand for the bid to be valid. But Player 0 has 8 digits, just like me. The total possible 7s in the game could be between 0 and 8 (since my hand has none, their hand could have 0 to 8). However, the bid is 2 7s. \n\nIf I challenge, the total 7s would be whatever Player 0 has. If they actually have two or more 7s, they win. But if they have less than two, I win. Since I have none, the chance that they have at least two 7s depends on their hand. \n\nBut maybe it's risky to challenge here because 7s are not too common, but they could have a couple. Alternatively, I can make a higher bid. The current bid is 2 7s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity (like 3 of any digit) or keep the quantity the same but increase the digit (e.g., 2 8s). \n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 1s, two 6s, two 8s. So if I bid 3 of a digit, say 1s, 6s, or 8s, that would be higher. For example, 3 1s. But I only have two, so the opponent would need at least one more. Alternatively, I could bid 2 8s, which is higher than 2 7s. Since 8 is higher than 7, that's a valid bid. \n\nBidding 2 8s would be a safe move based on my own hand, as I have two. If the opponent has at least one 8, the total would be three or more. But if they have none, the total is two, which meets the bid. Wait, no: the bid is for the total count. If I bid 2 8s, but I already have two, then even if the opponent has none, the total is two, which meets the bid. So that's a safe bid because the total is at least two. But the current bid is 2 7s, so 2 8s is a higher bid. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 3 of a lower digit, like 3 1s. But I have two, so opponent needs at least one. But that's possible. However, 3 1s is a higher quantity, so that's a valid bid. \n\nComparing the two options: 2 8s (same quantity, higher digit) vs. 3 1s (higher quantity, lower digit). Which one is better? \n\nIf I bid 3 1s, the opponent might challenge if they don't have any 1s. But I have two, so total is at least two. If they have at least one, it's three. But if they have none, then total is two, which is less than three, so I lose if challenged. \n\nBidding 2 8s is safer because even if the opponent has zero, the total is two, which meets the bid. So that's a guaranteed valid bid. But wait, the bid is 2 8s, which would require that there are at least two 8s in total. Since I have two, even if the opponent has none, the total is two, which meets the bid. So that's a safe bid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid 3 6s. I have two 6s. If the opponent has at least one, total is three, which meets the bid. But if they have none, it's two, which is less. So that's riskier. \n\nSo the safest bid seems to be 2 8s. Because even if the opponent has zero, the total is exactly two. So that's a valid bid. Therefore, bidding 2 8s would be a safe move. \n\nAlternatively, if I challenge, but since I have no 7s, the opponent must have at least two 7s. But how likely is that? They have eight digits. The chance they have two 7s is possible, but maybe not that high. If they're bluffing, challenging could win. But it's a risk. \n\nWeighing the options: If I challenge and they have two or more 7s, I lose. If they have less than two, I win. Since I have none, the total is whatever they have. So if they have zero or one, I win. If they have two or more, I lose. \n\nBut given that the bid is 2 7s, which is a low quantity, maybe they have some. But given that there are eight digits in their hand, the chance of having two 7s is possible. It's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, making a safe bid like 2 8s could be better. Because that's a guaranteed valid bid (since I have two), forcing the opponent to either bid higher or challenge. Since if they challenge, the total is at least two (my two), so I win. \n\nTherefore, the best move is to bid 2 8s. That's a higher bid than 2 7s because 8 is higher than 7, and the quantity is the same. It's a safe bid because even if the opponent has no 8s, the total is exactly two. So it's a valid bid. \n\nAnother option could be to bid 3 1s, but that's riskier. Alternatively, 2 8s seems safer. So I think the best action is to bid 2 8s.\n"
