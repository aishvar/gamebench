        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 4 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '7 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 32 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.",

It's possible there are at least 7 5s in total, but it's becoming increasingly unlikely as the bidding goes up. However, challenging now risks revealing my hand and potentially losing if there *are* 7 or more 5s. I can bid 8 5s to put pressure on the other players, or I can bid on a different digit. I have two 9s, so bidding 2 9s is a safe, valid bid. Alternatively, I have one 0, and it's unlikely anyone would bid high on 0s. However, the previous bids suggest players are focusing on 5s and 1s. Therefore, increasing the quantity of 5s is the most logical play. Bidding 8 5s is a reasonable bluff, as it's only one higher. I'll go with that.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 8 5s\"\n}\n```",
