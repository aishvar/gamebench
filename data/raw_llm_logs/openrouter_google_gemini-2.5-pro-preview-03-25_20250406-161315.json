        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

For the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) must have at least two 8s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having two or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively low (approximately 19% based on binomial probability: 1 - P(0) - P(1) = 1 - (0.9^8) - (8 * 0.1 * 0.9^7) \u2248 0.187). Therefore, it is statistically more likely that the total number of 8s is less than 3. While Player 0's jump from '2 5s' to '3 8s' could indicate strength, it's also a plausible bluff. Making a higher bid, such as '4 1s' or '4 3s' (based on my two 1s and two 3s), would require the opponent to have at least two of that digit, which carries a similar low probability of being true (around 19%). Challenging the current bid seems like the safest move based on the probabilities.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
