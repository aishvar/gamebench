        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, my hand is 20429351. So, I have the digits 2, 0, 4, 2, 9, 3, 5, 1. Let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\nLooking at each digit:\n- 0: I have one 0.\n- 1: One 1.\n- 2: Two 2s.\n- 3: One 3.\n- 4: One 4.\n- 5: One 5.\n- 9: One 9.\nSo, the digits I have are 0,1,2,3,4,5,9, with 2 appearing twice.\n\nSince it's the beginning of the game and there are no previous bids, the current bid is None. That means I can start by making the first bid. \n\nIn Liar's Poker, the goal is to make a bid that's higher than the previous one or challenge if you think it's too high. Since there's no previous bid, I can choose any digit and quantity. \n\nI need to decide what digit to bid on. My hand has a couple of 2s, which might be a good starting point. Bidding on a digit I have more of could be safer because it increases the chance that the total across both players meets or exceeds my bid. \n\nLooking at my 2s, I have two of them. So, if I bid 2 2s, that's a safe start. But maybe I can go higher. Since the maximum any digit can have is 16 (each player has 8 digits), but that's probably too optimistic. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit, but I only have one of each. If I bid on 9, for example, and the opponent doesn't have any, I could lose. So, it's safer to bid on a digit I have more of.\n\nAnother consideration is that the opponent might have some of the same digits. Since I have two 2s, maybe the opponent has none or a couple. If I bid 2 2s, the total could be 2, 3, or 4. If I bid 3 2s, the opponent would need to have at least one 2 for the total to be 3 or more. \n\nBut since it's the first bid, I don't want to overreach. Starting with a lower bid might be better to set a foundation. So, I think I'll bid 2 2s. It's a safe starting point, and I have some control over it with my own hand.\n\nWait, but maybe I can go higher. Since I have two 2s, if I bid 3 2s, and the opponent has at least one, it's valid. But if they have none, then I lose. So, is it worth the risk? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can choose a higher digit with just one, but that's riskier. So, sticking with 2s seems better. \n\nI think I'll go with 3 2s as my bid. That way, I'm using my two 2s, and hoping the opponent has at least one more. It's a bit of a gamble, but it's the first move, so it's manageable. Plus, it's higher than the current bid of None, so it's a valid move.\n"
