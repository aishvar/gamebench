        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 2s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, let's try to figure out what to do here. So, I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. The current bid is 2 2s by Player 0. I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge.\n\nFirst, I'll look at my hand. I have the digits 8, 1, 8, 3, 7, 6, 7, 7. So, let me count them: one 1, one 3, two 6s, three 7s, and two 8s. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me recount. The digits are 8,1,8,3,7,6,7,7. So, 1 appears once, 3 once, 6 once, 7 three times, and 8 twice. So, no 2s in my hand at all.\n\nSince the current bid is 2 2s, and I don't have any 2s, I have to think about whether Player 0 might be bluffing or not. But I also need to consider what possible bids I can make. My options are to either bid higher or challenge.\n\nIf I were to bid higher, I have to make sure it's a strictly higher bid. That means either a higher quantity or the same quantity but a higher digit. Since the current bid is 2 2s, I could bid 3 of any digit, or 2 of a digit higher than 2, like 2 3s, 2 4s, etc.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have three 7s. So, I could potentially bid 3 7s. That would be a higher quantity than 2, so that's a valid bid. Alternatively, I could bid 2 3s, but I only have one 3, so that's not helpful. Or 2 6s, but I only have one 6. So, the best option seems to be to bid 3 7s.\n\nBut wait, is that a smart move? If I bid 3 7s, and the total number of 7s between both players is at least 3, I might win. But since I have three 7s, even if the other player has none, the total is exactly 3. So, the bid would be valid. But if the other player also has some 7s, it's even safer.\n\nAlternatively, I could challenge the current bid of 2 2s. If I challenge, and the total number of 2s is less than 2, I win. But since I have zero 2s, the other player must have at least 2 for the bid to be valid. If they have 2 or more, I lose. If they have 1 or 0, I win. But without knowing their hand, it's a gamble.\n\nConsidering that I have a strong hand with three 7s, it might be better to bid 3 7s. That way, I'm making a move based on my own strength rather than guessing about the opponent's. Plus, if I challenge and lose, I might be at a disadvantage later. So, bidding seems safer and more strategic.\n\nSo, I think I'll go with bidding 3 7s. It's a higher quantity than the current bid, and I have the cards to back it up.\n"
