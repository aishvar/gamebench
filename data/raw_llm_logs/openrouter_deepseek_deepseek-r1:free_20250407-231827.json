You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I'm Player 0, and the current bid is None, so I need to make the first bid. My hand is 78529627. Let me count how many of each digit I have.\n\nLooking at my digits: 7, 8, 5, 2, 9, 6, 2, 7. So breaking it down:\n\n- 0: 0\n- 1: 0\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 0\n- 4: 0\n- 5: 1\n- 6: 1\n- 7: 2\n- 8: 1\n- 9: 1\n\nSo the highest count in my hand is 2 for digits 2 and 7. Since I have two 2s and two 7s, maybe I should start with a bid that's based on that. But since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total possible for any digit is 16 (if all 16 digits were the same, which is impossible, but the max possible is 16). \n\nSince I have two of 2s and 7s, maybe I can assume that the opponent might have at least one more. So if I bid, say, three 2s, that's a starting point. But since the first bid can be any, but I want to set a reasonable one that's not too high. Alternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, if I bid two 7s, but since the current bid is None, I can start with that. Wait, but the first bid has to be at least one of any digit. Wait, no, the rules say the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'. How does that work? Since there's no previous bid, the first player can bid any quantity and digit. Wait, no, the rules say \"Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" But how is 'None' compared? Maybe the first bid can be any valid bid, since there's nothing to compare. Wait, maybe the initial bid can be any, as there's no prior bid. But the instruction says \"strictly higher than the current bid 'None'\". Hmm, perhaps the first bid is allowed to be any, because 'None' is considered as the lowest possible. So the first player can bid anything. \n\nIn that case, I need to make a bid that's a good starting point. Since I have two 2s and two 7s, maybe I can start with a bid that's based on that. For example, bidding two 2s. But since the opponent has 8 digits, there's a chance they have more. But maybe starting with a lower quantity but higher digit. Wait, but the first bid can be anything. Maybe a safe starting bid would be two 7s, since I have two, and 7 is a higher digit than 2. Alternatively, maybe start with a higher digit to force the opponent to either bid higher quantity or higher digit. \n\nAlternatively, since the maximum possible is 16, but realistically, the opponent might have 0-8 of any digit. So if I have two 2s, maybe the total is 2 (mine) plus whatever the opponent has. If I bid three 2s, that's possible. But if the opponent has at least one 2, then the total is three. So that's a safe bid. Alternatively, if I bid two 7s, which I have two, and the opponent might have one or more. But maybe starting with a higher digit is better. \n\nWait, the bid has to be strictly higher than the current bid (None). So any bid is allowed. So the first player can start with any quantity and digit. So the best strategy is to start with a bid that's likely to be true based on your own hand, but not too high. For example, if I have two 2s, bidding three 2s is a possible start. Or maybe two 7s. Alternatively, since 7 is a higher digit, maybe start with two 7s. Because if the opponent has even one 7, the total is three, which would make the bid valid. But if I bid two 7s, and the opponent has none, then the total is two, which meets the bid. Wait, the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So if I bid two 7s, and there are exactly two, then the bid is valid. So if I have two, and the opponent has zero, then the total is two, which meets the bid. So that's safe. So bidding two 7s is a safe opening bid. Alternatively, maybe even one 8s, but I have one 8. But that's riskier. \n\nAlternatively, since I have two 2s, maybe bid three 2s. If the opponent has at least one, then it's valid. If not, then it's three vs two, which would be a lie. But as the first bid, maybe starting with a lower quantity but higher digit is better. For example, two 7s. Because 7 is higher than 2, and the quantity is the same. So if I bid two 7s, the next player has to either bid higher quantity (like three of any digit) or same quantity but higher digit (like two 8s, 9s). Since I have two 7s, and the opponent might have some, it's a reasonable bid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, one 9. I have one 9. If I bid one 9s, then the next player has to bid higher. But that's a low quantity. But maybe that's too easy to challenge. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the opponent's hand is unknown, but the total possible for any digit is 16. But starting with a bid that's based on my own hand. Since I have two 2s and two 7s, maybe the safest opening is to bid two 7s. That way, even if the opponent has none, the total is two, which meets the bid. So it's a safe bid. Because if I bid two 7s, and the total is two, then the bid is valid. So I can't lose if I bid two 7s. Because even if the opponent has zero, my two 7s make the total two. So that's a guaranteed valid bid. Therefore, that's a safe opening. \n\nSo the action would be to bid two 7s. The reasoning is that I have two 7s in my hand, so the total is at least two. Therefore, the bid is safe and starts the game with a valid bid."
