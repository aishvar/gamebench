        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, let's see. I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. My hand is 2, 6, 7, 1, 3, 2, 4, 8. So, I have eight digits here. Let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\nStarting with 0s: I don't have any. 1s: there's one. 2s: I have two of them. 3s: one. 4s: one. 5s: none. 6s: one. 7s: one. 8s: one. 9s: none. \n\nSo, the digits I have are spread out, but I have two 2s. That's the highest count in my hand. The current bid is None, so I can start the bidding. \n\nI need to decide whether to make a bid or challenge, but since the bid is None, I have to make a bid. The goal is to make a bid that's as high as possible but still believable, so the opponent might not challenge it. \n\nSince I have two 2s, I can bid on 2s. But maybe I can bid higher than that. Let me think about the maximum possible. The total number of each digit across both players is up to 16, since each has 8 digits. \n\nIf I bid 2 2s, that's a safe start because I have two in my hand. But maybe I can go higher. Wait, but if I bid 3 2s, that means the opponent must have at least one 2. If I have two, and the opponent has one, that's three. But if the opponent has none, then the total is only two, and if someone challenges, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, I can bid a higher digit with a lower quantity. For example, maybe bid 2 3s. But I only have one 3, so the opponent would need to have one as well. That's risky. \n\nAnother option is to bid 2 6s. I have one 6, so the opponent would need to have one. But if they have none, I lose. \n\nWait, maybe I should stick with what I have. I have two 2s, so I can safely bid 2 2s. That's a solid start. It's not too high, so the opponent might not challenge it immediately. Plus, if they do challenge, since I have two, unless they have zero, the total would be two, which meets the bid. But if they have one, it's three, which is still higher than the bid. So, it's a safe bet. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 2s. Since I have two, if the opponent has at least one, the total is three or more. But if they have none, I lose. So, it's a bit risky. \n\nI think starting with 2 2s is safer. It's a low bid, and the opponent might let it pass. If they challenge, and I have two, the opponent must have zero for me to lose, which is possible but not certain. \n\nSo, I'll go with BID: 2 2s.\n"
