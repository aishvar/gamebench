The bid '1 0s' claims there is at least one '0' across all digits. My hand contains one '0'. Therefore, the statement 'at least one 0 exists' is TRUE. Challenging the bid would be incorrect as the bid is true. I must make a higher bid. A higher bid must increase the quantity (to 2 or more) or keep the quantity at 1 and increase the digit (to 1-9). I should preferably make a bid that is true based on my own hand. My hand contains one '0', one '4', two '6's, one '7', two '8's, and one '9'. Possible true bids higher than '1 0s' include '1 4s', '1 6s', '1 7s', '1 8s', '1 9s', '2 6s', and '2 8s'. It's generally a good strategy to bid based on the digits I hold, especially those I have multiples of. I have two '6's and two '8's. Bidding '2 6s' or '2 8s' is truthful based on my hand alone. '2 6s' is the lower of these two options, leaving more bidding space. It is a safe bid, higher than the current bid, and reflects the strength of my hand in '6's.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 6s\"\n}\n```",
