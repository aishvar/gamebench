For the total to be at least 3, the opponent needs to have at least one 1 in their hand of 8 digits. This is reasonably likely, so challenging now is risky. Instead, I can increase the bid conservatively. The next valid bids would be 3 2s or 4 1s. Since I have no 2s, bidding 3 2s is risky. Bidding 4 1s would require the opponent to have at least two 1s, which is less probable, so it's better to avoid that. Alternatively, I can bid 3 3s, since I have one 3, but that requires the opponent to have at least two 3s, which is unlikely. The safest is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity at 3, so I will bid 3 4s. I have one 4, so the opponent would need two 4s, which is plausible. This is a reasonable incremental bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 4s\"\n}",
