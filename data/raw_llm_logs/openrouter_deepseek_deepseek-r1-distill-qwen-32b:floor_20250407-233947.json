        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out what move to make in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, I have the hand: 92948447. Let me count the digits I have. Breaking it down:\n\n- 9 appears twice.\n- 2 appears once.\n- 4 appears three times.\n- 8 appears once.\n- 7 appears once.\n\nSo, in my hand, the digit 4 occurs three times. That's the highest count for any digit in my hand.\n\nSince the current bid is 'None', I can make the first bid. My goal is to make a bid that's likely to be true based on my hand but also gives me a good chance of winning if the opponent challenges or if they make a higher bid.\n\nLooking at the digits, 4 is the digit I have the most of. If I bid on 4s, I can start with a quantity that's higher than what I have, but not too high that it's obviously a lie. Since I have three 4s, I might consider bidding 4 4s. That's a reasonable jump because it's possible that the opponent has at least one 4, making the total four or more.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit to make the bid more attractive. For example, if I bid 4 5s, it's a higher digit but I don't have any 5s in my hand. That might be riskier because if the opponent has no 5s, the bid could be easily challenged.\n\nSo, sticking with the digit I have the most of seems safer. Bidding 4 4s is a good starting point because it's plausible that the total number of 4s across both hands is at least four. If the opponent has one or two 4s, that would make the total meet or exceed my bid.\n\nI don't see any immediate reason to challenge because there's no previous bid to challenge. So, making a bid is the way to go.\n\nIn conclusion, I'll bid 4 4s because it's based on my hand and gives a reasonable estimate considering the opponent's possible digits.\n"
