You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I'm Player 0, and the current bid is None, so I have to make the first bid. My hand is 47567996. Let me count the digits here. \n\nLooking at my hand: 4,7,5,6,7,9,9,6. So I have two 7s, two 6s, two 9s, one 4, one 5. So the highest count I have is two of several digits. Since there are three players, each with 8 digits, that's 24 digits total. \n\nSince I'm the first to bid, I need to start with a reasonable bid that's not too high but also gives me some leverage. The first bid should be low enough to not get challenged immediately but also set a base. The lowest possible bid would be something like 1 of any digit, but maybe I can go a bit higher based on my own hand.\n\nI have two 7s, two 6s, and two 9s. If I bid two of one of these, that's possible because there are two in my hand. But since other players have 16 digits combined, there could be more. For example, if I bid three 6s, that's possible. But maybe starting with a bid of two 9s? Wait, the first bid has to be higher than None, which is the starting point. Since there's no previous bid, I can start with any valid bid. The minimum bid is 1 of any digit, but since I have two of several digits, maybe starting with two 7s or two 6s. But maybe it's better to start with a higher digit to make the next player's options harder. For example, if I bid two 9s, then the next player has to either bid three of any digit or a higher digit with two. Since 9 is the highest digit, they can't go higher in digit, so they'd have to increase the quantity. But that might make them challenge if they think there aren't three 9s. Alternatively, starting with a lower digit but higher quantity. \n\nWait, but since the current bid is None, any bid I make is valid. So the strategy here is to start with a bid that's plausible based on my own hand, but also not too risky. Since I have two 9s, maybe bid two 9s. That way, if others have at least one 9, the total could be three or more. Alternatively, maybe bid two 6s. But 9 is a higher digit, so if I bid two 9s, the next player can't bid two of a higher digit, so they have to go to three of any digit. That could be a better move. Let me think. If I start with two 9s, the next player must either bid three of any digit or challenge. But challenging a two 9s bid when there are 24 digits in total might be risky because there's a chance. So they might bid three of something else. But if they have, say, three 5s, they could bid that. Alternatively, maybe starting with a lower digit but higher quantity. But the problem is, with no prior bid, I can choose any. \n\nAlternatively, since I have two 9s, and the total possible 9s could be up to 24 (though that's impossible), but realistically, maybe three or four. So a bid of two 9s is safe. Because even if the other players have one each, that's two plus maybe two more, making four. But if I bid two 9s, and the actual count is three or four, then the bid is valid. So starting with two 9s seems reasonable. Alternatively, maybe bid three of a lower digit. Wait, but I only have two 6s, two 7s, etc. If I bid three 6s, that's possible if other players have at least one 6. But since I have two, maybe there's a higher chance. But three is a higher quantity, so the next player would have to bid three of a higher digit or four of any. But maybe that's riskier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a bid that's a middle digit, like 5, which I have one of. If I bid two 5s, then even though I have one, maybe others have one each. But that's a risk. So maybe better to go with the digits I have more of. \n\nSo considering all that, I think starting with two 9s is a solid opening bid. It's based on my own hand, and it's a high digit, which forces the next player to increase the quantity if they want to bid higher. So the action would be BID: 2 9s.\n"
