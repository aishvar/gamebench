        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 4s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Given that each player has 8 digits, there are 16 digits in total. I have only one '4', meaning Player 0 would need at least two '4's in their hand alone to justify their bid. Although this is possible, the jump from '2 1s' to '3 4s' seems aggressive, potentially indicating a bluff. However, since having two '4's in their hand isn't unlikely, challenging immediately might be risky. A safer move would be to increase the bid slightly with a digit I have multiple of. I have two '1's, making a bid of '3 6s' or '3 7s' risky since I only have one each. Instead, bidding '3 9s' or '3 8s' would also be risky as I have only one '8' and no '9'. Given this, I prefer to cautiously increase the bid to '3 6s', as I have one '6', and it's plausible Player 0 also has at least two '6's or the bid could provoke a challenge from them, which I can handle.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 6s\"\n}",
