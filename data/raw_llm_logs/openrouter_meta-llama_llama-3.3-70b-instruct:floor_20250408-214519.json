        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 4s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since my hand does not contain any 4s, and considering the opponent has already bid 3 4s, I must decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. Given that I don't have any 4s and the highest digit I have in abundance is the 8, which appears three times, making a bid on 8s could be risky without knowing the opponent's hand. However, since I need to make a strictly higher bid, and considering the distribution of my digits, bidding on a higher digit or increasing the quantity seems necessary. The opponent's bid of 3 4s suggests they might have at least one or two 4s, but without more information, challenging seems like a gamble. Instead, I will focus on what I can control - my knowledge of my hand and the need to increase the bid. Since I have three 8s, and the current bid is on 4s, I can try to bid on a higher digit or the same digit with a higher quantity. Given my hand and the goal to make a higher bid, I will choose to bid on 8s, as it's a digit I have in relative abundance compared to others, and it's higher than 4.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 8s\"\n}",
