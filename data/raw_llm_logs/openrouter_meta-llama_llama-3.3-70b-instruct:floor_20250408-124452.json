        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since my hand contains no 6s but has multiple 5s and other digits, increasing the digit seems risky without more information. However, increasing the quantity to 5 for the digit 6 is a possibility, but considering I have no 6s, this might be risky. Another option is to increase the digit, for example, bidding on 4 7s or more, considering the distribution of digits in my hand. Given the presence of 8s and 9s in my hand and the fact that bidding on these higher digits could be strategic, I should consider if the risk is worth the potential gain. Challenging the current bid of 4 6s could also be an option if I believe it's unlikely, but without more insight into Player 1's hand, this is a gamble. Since I have no 6s and the bid is already at 4, challenging seems reasonable because even if I don't have any 6s, the total count of 6s being exactly 4 or more across both hands might be unlikely.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
