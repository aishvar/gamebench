        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

The digits I have are: 0, 2, 6, 6, 0, 9, 7, 5. \n\nFirst, I'll count how many of each digit I have. \n\n- 0 appears twice.\n- 2 appears once.\n- 6 appears twice.\n- 9 appears once.\n- 7 appears once.\n- 5 appears once.\n\nSo, my hand has two 0s, two 6s, and one each of 2, 5, 7, 9. \n\nSince it's my turn and the current bid is None, I need to make the first bid. The goal is to make a bid that's likely to be true but also gives me a good chance of winning if someone challenges it. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 0s. But since the other player has 8 digits, the total number of 0s could be up to 16. However, it's unlikely that there are many 0s because each player only has 8 digits. \n\nI also have two 6s. That's a decent number. If I bid on 6s, I can start with a quantity higher than what's in my hand to make it more challenging for the opponent. Maybe bid 3 6s. That way, if the opponent doesn't have many 6s, I can challenge them if they go higher. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 0s, but since I only have two, it's a bit risky. Bidding 3 0s might be too high, especially if the opponent doesn't have any. \n\nConsidering the digits I have, 6 seems like a good choice because I have two of them, and it's a higher digit than 0, which might make it more attractive for the opponent to challenge or go higher. \n\nSo, I think bidding 3 6s is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than my hand, but not excessively so, giving me a good balance between being believable and having a chance to win if challenged.\n"
