        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the current bid is 3 6s from Player 1. My hand is 40085743. I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have the digits: 4, 0, 0, 8, 5, 7, 4, 3. So, I have two 4s, two 0s, and one each of 8,5,7,3. I don't have any 6s in my hand. That's important because the current bid is about 6s.\n\nNow, the total number of digits in play is 16 (each player has 8). So, if Player 1 is bidding 3 6s, that means they think there are at least three 6s between both players. Since I don't have any 6s, all the 6s must be in Player 1's hand. \n\nSo, Player 1 must have at least three 6s in their 8 digits. But wait, the maximum number of any digit a player can have is 8, but in this case, I have none, so Player 1 could have up to 8 6s. But the bid is only 3, so it's possible they have exactly 3, which would make the total exactly 3. \n\nBut I'm considering whether to challenge. If I challenge and the total is 3 or more, Player 1 wins. If it's less than 3, I win. Since I have zero 6s, the total depends entirely on Player 1's hand. \n\nI don't have any 6s, so if Player 1 has 3, the total is exactly 3, which meets the bid. If they have more, it's higher. But if they have exactly 3, the bid is valid. So, is it likely that Player 1 has exactly 3 6s? Or are they bluffing?\n\nGiven that the previous bid was 2 4s from me, Player 1 upped it to 3 6s. Maybe they have a few 6s and are trying to get me to fold. But without knowing their hand, it's a bit risky. \n\nAlternatively, I could try to make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 3 6s, I can either bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. But I don't have any 6s, so I can't safely bid on 6s. What about other digits?\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 4s and two 0s. So, maybe I can bid on 4s or 0s. The previous bid was 2 4s from me, and then Player 1 went to 3 6s. If I have two 4s, the total could be 2 plus whatever Player 1 has. But I don't know if Player 1 has any 4s. Similarly, I have two 0s, but again, without knowing Player 1's 0s, it's hard to say.\n\nIf I try to bid on 4s, I could go for 3 4s. But if Player 1 has at least one 4, that would make the total 3. But if they have none, then the total is 2, which is less than my bid. That's risky because if I bid 3 4s and the total is only 2, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit. For example, 3 7s or something, but I only have one 7. That seems even riskier. \n\nSo, considering all this, maybe challenging is the safer option. Since I don't have any 6s, if Player 1 has exactly 3, I lose. But if they have less, I win. However, I don't know their hand. \n\nBut wait, in Liar's Poker, players often try to bluff. Maybe Player 1 doesn't have 3 6s and is just trying to make me fold. If I challenge and they have less than 3, I win. If they have 3 or more, I lose. \n\nGiven that I have zero 6s, the only way the total is 3 or more is if Player 1 has all of them. So, the question is, is it likely that Player 1 has 3 or more 6s? They might, but I don't have any information about their hand. \n\nAlternatively, I could make a bid on another digit where I have more control. For example, I have two 0s. If I bid 3 0s, and Player 1 doesn't have any, then I lose. But if they have at least one, then the total is 3 or more. But I don't know. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. I think challenging might be the better option here because I don't have any 6s, and if Player 1 is bluffing, I can win. But if they're not bluffing, I lose. It's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid on a digit I have more of, like 0s. I have two, so if I bid 3 0s, it's possible that Player 1 has at least one, making the total 3. But if they have none, I lose. \n\nI think challenging is the way to go because I don't have any 6s, and it's possible that Player 1 is bluffing. Plus, I don't have a strong basis to make a higher bid on another digit without more information.\n"
