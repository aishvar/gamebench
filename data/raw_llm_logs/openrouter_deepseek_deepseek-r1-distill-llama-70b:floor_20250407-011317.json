You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn to make a bid since the current bid is None. My hand is 38445841. Let me analyze this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules. Each player has 8 secret digits, so there are 16 digits in total. Bids are about the total count of a specific digit across both players. The bid must be a quantity and a digit, like \"3 5s\". The next bid has to be higher, either in quantity or the same quantity but a higher digit. If someone challenges, we reveal the count, and whoever is right wins.\n\nSince it's the first bid, I can set the starting point. My hand is 3,8,4,4,5,8,4,1. Let me count the digits I have:\n\n- 0s: 0\n- 1s: 1\n- 2s: 0\n- 3s: 1\n- 4s: 3\n- 5s: 1\n- 6s: 0\n- 7s: 0\n- 8s: 2\n- 9s: 0\n\nSo, I have 3 4s, 2 8s, and 1 each of 1,3,5.\n\nI need to decide what to bid. Since I have multiple 4s, maybe I can bid on 4s. The highest I can go is 3 4s. Alternatively, I could bid on 8s with 2, but that's lower. Maybe I can bid 3 4s as the starting point.\n\nBut wait, is 3 4s a good opening? It's a moderate bid. Maybe I can go higher. If I bid 4 4s, that would require the opponent to have at least one 4. If they don't, then I might lose if challenged. But since I have 3, maybe it's safe to bid 3 4s.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the highest digit I have, which is 8. I have two of them. So I could bid 2 8s. But 3 4s seems better because it's a higher quantity.\n\nI think starting with 3 4s is a solid move. It's a reasonable bid that's likely to be true, and it gives me a good starting point without overcommitting. If the opponent challenges, I have a good chance of winning because I have three 4s. If they don't challenge, I can continue bidding higher in the next turns.\n\nSo, the action should be to bid 3 4s.\n"
