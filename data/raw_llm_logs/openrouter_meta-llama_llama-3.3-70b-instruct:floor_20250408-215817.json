        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

However, I do have repeated digits that could potentially be bid upon. Since I need to make a strictly higher bid, I could either increase the quantity or the digit. Given that my hand contains two 6s and no 9s, bidding on a higher digit than 9 is not possible since 9 is the highest digit. Thus, I must consider increasing the quantity of a digit I have. However, without knowing the opponent's hand, it's risky to bid high on any digit without strong confidence. Considering the safest option, I could try to bid on a digit I have in abundance, but since I don't have more than two of any digit besides the 2s, and bidding '5 2s' would not be a valid increase from '4 9s' in terms of digit value, I must think strategically about challenging or finding a digit to bid on. Given the information and the goal to make a valid higher bid, I should consider the likelihood of the current bid being true and the potential for winning by challenging it. The bid '4 9s' seems somewhat high but not impossible given that each player has 8 digits and there are only two players. However, without having any 9s in my hand, I'm inclined to doubt the bid's validity, especially considering that to fulfill this bid, the other player must have at least 4 nines or we together must have at least 4 nines. This seems unlikely but not impossible. Given the uncertainty and the fact that I don't have a strong basis for a higher bid, challenging seems like a reasonable strategy, especially since making an incorrect bid could lead to losing if challenged back.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
