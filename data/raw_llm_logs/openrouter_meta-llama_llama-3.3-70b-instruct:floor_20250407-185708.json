Since the bid is '2 5s', I need to consider if there could be at least two 5s in total between both players' hands. Without knowing Player 1's hand, I must decide based on probability and the information I have. Since I only have one 5, to make a higher bid, I would need to bid on a higher digit or a higher quantity of the same digit. However, given that I do not have any information suggesting a higher digit is more abundant, and I can only see one 5 in my hand, challenging the bid seems like a reasonable option if I believe two 5s might be unlikely across both hands.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
