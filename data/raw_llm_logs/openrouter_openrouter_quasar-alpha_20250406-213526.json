        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since the total number of digits is 16, and I have none, the opponent would need at least 3 9s in their hand for the bid of 3 9s to be valid. While this is possible, it is somewhat unlikely for a single player to hold 3 or more of a specific digit. However, it's not improbable enough to justify an immediate challenge. Instead, I can safely raise the bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, choosing a digit where I hold multiple copies. I have two 0s, so bidding 3 0s increases the digit to a lower value but is a valid higher bid due to the digit order. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity with a digit I have multiples of. Since I have two 0s, raising to 4 0s is a reasonable, slightly aggressive but defensible bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 0s\"\n}",
