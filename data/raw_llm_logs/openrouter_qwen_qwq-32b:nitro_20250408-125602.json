You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out my first move in this Liar's Poker game. Let's start by looking at the current situation. The user's hand is 29789153. Let me list out those digits: 2, 9, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5, 3. So I should count how many of each digit I have here.\n\nFirst, let me tally each digit in my own hand. \n\nLooking at the digits:\n- 1 appears once.\n- 2 once.\n- 3 once.\n- 5 once.\n- 7 once.\n- 8 once.\n- 9 appears twice.\n\nSo the counts in my hand are:\n1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 5:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:2. The rest (0,4,6) are 0 in my hand.\n\nSince the current bid is None, I have to make the first bid. The bid has to be a valid starting bid. The rules say a bid must be strictly higher than the current bid, which here is nothing, so I can choose any starting point. But I need to pick a bid that's strategic. \n\nThe goal is to either make a bid that's believable but hard for the opponent to beat, or to set up a challenge later. Since it's the first bid, I can choose any digit and quantity. The key is to pick a digit that's common enough in the total of both hands (mine plus theirs), but not so high that it's easy to challenge. Alternatively, I might want to pick a digit that I have some of, to have a better chance.\n\nLooking at my hand, the highest count I have is two 9s. If I bid 2 9s, that's the minimum, but since it's the first bid, maybe I can go higher. Alternatively, maybe pick a digit I have and bid a little higher. \n\nAlternatively, since I have two 9s, maybe I can bid 3 9s. That way, even if the opponent has one 9, the total would be 3, so that's a safe bid? Or maybe not, because the opponent might not have any. \n\nAlternatively, maybe pick a different digit. Let's see. For digits I have only one of, like 1,2,3,5,7,8. If I bid 2 of those, maybe that's possible. For example, if I bid 2 8s, since I have one, maybe the opponent might have one. But that's still a low bid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe go for a higher digit. Since digits are ranked, a higher digit can allow a lower quantity but still be a valid bid. For instance, if I bid 1 9s, that's a higher digit than any other bid, but since the bid is the first, maybe that's okay. Wait, but the bid has to be strictly higher than the previous. Since there's no previous, any bid is allowed. But starting with a low quantity but high digit might be a way to set up for the next player to have to either raise the quantity or go to a higher digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a mid-range bid. Let's think. The total possible digits are 16 (8 each). The maximum possible for any digit is 16. So if I bid something like 3 of a digit I have, maybe that's manageable. \n\nLooking at my hand, the 9s are the highest count. So maybe bidding 3 9s would be a good start. Since I have two, there's a chance the opponent has one. Alternatively, if I bid 2 9s, but that might be too low. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps pick a digit that's not in my hand but is a high digit. Wait, but that's risky. For example, if I bid 3 0s, but since I have none, the opponent might have none as well, leading to a challenge. \n\nAlternatively, maybe pick a common digit. Let's see. The digits in my hand are spread out. The opponent's hand is unknown. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a bid that's just slightly above the minimum possible. Since I have two 9s, bidding 3 9s gives me a decent chance. If the opponent doesn't have any, then the total would be 2, which is less than 3. But if I bid 3, then if the opponent challenges, I lose. Hmm. So maybe that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a bid on a digit that I have one of, but bid two. Like, for example, 2 8s. Since I have one, maybe the opponent has one, making it 2. So that's safe. But is that a good starting bid? Since the first bid can be anything, but you want to set a base that's hard to beat. \n\nAlternatively, maybe go for a higher quantity but lower digit. For example, 4 5s. But I only have one 5. That's risky. \n\nAlternatively, bid 2 9s. Since I have two, that's exactly my count. But the bid must be on the total count (both hands). So my bid would be 2 9s, but the opponent might have none, so total is 2. If someone else bids higher, say 3 9s, then I can challenge. Wait, but as the first bid, I can choose to set it at 2, but maybe that's too low, and the opponent can easily raise it. \n\nHmm, perhaps the best approach is to start with a bid that's slightly above the count in my hand, but not too high. Let me think again. Since I have two 9s, maybe bid 3 9s. If the opponent has at least one 9, then the total is 3, so the bid holds. If they have none, then the total is 2, which would mean the bid is wrong. But since I'm the first to bid, if I get challenged, I lose. But maybe the opponent won't challenge unless they think it's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe choose a digit that I have more of. Wait, I don't have any digit more than two. The 9s are the highest. \n\nAlternatively, pick a digit that's not in my hand but is a high digit. Like 0. But I have no 0s, so that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe go for a lower digit but higher quantity. Like 4 1s. Since I have one, maybe the opponent has three. But that's a big ask. \n\nAlternatively, start with a mid-level bid like 3 7s. I have one, so maybe opponent has two. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best first move is to bid 2 9s. Since I have two, and it's a high digit. The next player can either raise the quantity or go to a higher digit (but 9 is the highest digit except 10, which isn't a digit here). Wait, digits are 0-9, so 9 is the highest. So if I bid 2 9s, the next player can only raise the quantity to 3 or more, or can't go higher in digit. So they have to go to higher quantity. \n\nAlternatively, maybe starting with a bid of 3 9s to set a higher bar. \n\nHmm. Let me think of probabilities. The opponent has 8 digits. The chance that they have at least one 9 is 1 - (8/10)^8? Wait, actually, each digit is independent, but in reality, the opponent's digits are fixed. Since I don't know their hand, I have to assume randomness. \n\nThe probability that the opponent has at least one 9 is 1 - (probability they have none). The chance that a single digit is not a 9 is 9/10. For 8 digits, it's (9/10)^8 \u2248 0.43. So about 43% chance they have no 9s. Thus, the total would be 2 (my two) + their 0 = 2. If I bid 3 9s, there's a 43% chance that the total is 2, so a challenge would win for them. But if they don't challenge, then I can keep going. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 9s, then the total is at least 2, which is true. Then the next player can't lower the bid, so they have to bid higher quantity (3 or more) or same quantity but higher digit (but 9 is the highest, so they can't). So they have to bid 3 9s or higher. Then I can decide whether to challenge that. \n\nStarting with 2 9s might be safer because it's true, so the opponent can't challenge it unless they think I'm lying, but since it's the first bid, they might not. However, the opponent might then have to raise to 3 9s, which could be risky for them. \n\nAlternatively, if I start with 3 9s, there's a chance they'll challenge immediately if they think it's too high. Since the bid is 3, and the total could be 2, they might challenge, and I lose. \n\nSo perhaps starting with 2 9s is safer because it's a true statement, so they can't challenge unless they have some reason to think otherwise. But since they don't know my hand, they might not know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a different digit. Let's see. Suppose I bid 3 of a digit I have one of, like 3 8s. I have one, opponent might have two. But that's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid on a digit that's common. For example, 1 appears once in my hand. Maybe bid 2 1s? If the opponent has one, then total is 2. \n\nHmm. Considering all options, perhaps the safest first bid is to bid the count of my highest digit plus one, to encourage others to have to increase, but not too high. \n\nAlternatively, since the first bid can be anything, maybe start with a bid that's a bit higher but plausible. Let's pick 3 9s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 2 9s to be safe. \n\nWait, the problem is that as the first bidder, I can choose any bid. The challenge comes later. Since I have two 9s, bidding 2 9s is valid, but then the next player can bid 3 9s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit but lower quantity. Since 9 is the highest digit, maybe starting with 1 9s would be a weak bid, but since it's the first bid, maybe that's okay. Then the next player can go to 2 9s, etc. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best first move is to bid 2 9s, since that's the highest digit and a quantity I can back up. \n\nAlternatively, maybe go for a higher quantity on a lower digit. For example, since I have two 9s, maybe bid 2 9s, which is safe, and then the next player has to go to 3 or higher. \n\nYes, that seems reasonable. So the first bid would be \"BID: 2 9s\". \n\nWait, but the current bid is None, so any bid is allowed. But perhaps I can set a higher bid. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a bid that's a bit higher to pressure the opponent. For instance, 3 9s. Since I have two, there's a chance the opponent has one. But if they have none, then it's 2, which is less than 3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to start with a bid that's exactly my count, so it's definitely true. So 2 9s. \n\nYes, that way, the bid is valid, and the opponent has to either raise the quantity to 3 or higher (which they might be hesitant to do unless they have confidence), or they can challenge, but since the bid is exactly my count, unless they have info, they might not. \n\nTherefore, the best first move is to bid 2 9s. \n\nWait, but maybe I can do better. Let me check. \n\nAnother angle: since I have two 9s, bidding 2 9s is the minimum possible for that digit. But maybe bidding a higher digit isn't possible (since 9 is the highest). \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 9s, the next player can choose to bid 3 9s, which I can then challenge if I think they don't have any. \n\nAlternatively, if I start higher, like 3 9s, but that's risky. \n\nHmm. Given that it's the first bid, perhaps starting at 2 9s is the safest because it's true and sets a base. The opponent might then have to raise, but if they don't have 9s, they might have to lie about another digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid a higher quantity on a different digit. Let's see. For example, I have one 1. Bidding 2 1s would require that the opponent has at least one 1. The chance that they have at least one 1 is 1 - (9/10)^8 \u2248 1 - 0.43 = 0.57, so about 57%. That's a 57% chance of being correct. Not great, but possible. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 8s, since I have one, there's a similar chance. \n\nAlternatively, since I have two 9s, it's safer to go with that. \n\nSo I think the best first bid is 2 9s. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'\". Since there's no previous bid, any bid is acceptable. So 2 9s is okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe starting with a higher quantity but lower digit, like 3 8s. Since I have one, maybe the opponent has two. But that's a 33% chance? Not sure. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe start with 3 5s. I have one, opponent might have two. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best is to go with the highest digit possible, which is 9, and the quantity I have. \n\nYes, so the bid should be 2 9s. \n\nWait, but the example given in the problem shows that when the current bid is None, you can start with any bid. The example 1 starts with 4 6s, which is higher than the previous (which was none). \n\nTherefore, the first bid can be any quantity and digit. To maximize my chances, I should choose a bid that I can defend, or that I can later challenge if necessary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a bid that's a bit higher than my own count. Let's see. If I bid 3 9s, then if the opponent doesn't have any, I could lose if they challenge. But if they don't challenge, then I can continue. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best is to bid 2 9s, which is safe, and then let the opponent have to raise. \n\nYes, that's probably the safer route. \n\nTherefore, the action should be \"BID: 2 9s\". \n\nWait, but the user's hand is 29789153. Let me confirm the digits again:\n\nDigits: 2,9,7,8,9,1,5,3. So two 9s. \n\nYes, so 2 9s is accurate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid higher on a different digit. Let me see. \n\nSuppose I bid 2 8s. I have one, so opponent needs one. That's a 43% chance (since the chance they have at least one 8 is 1 - (9/10)^8? Wait, no, for a specific digit like 8, the chance they have at least one is 1 - (9/10)^8 \u2248 1 - 0.43 = 0.57. \n\nSo 57% chance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 2 7s. I have one, so same as above. \n\nBut since 9 is the highest digit, bidding on 9 is better because even if the quantity is low, the digit is higher, so the next player has to either increase quantity or can't go higher. \n\nTherefore, bidding 2 9s is better. \n\nSo I think that's the best move. \n\nThus, the JSON should have action \"BID: 2 9s\" and reasoning about having two 9s and starting with that as a safe bid."
