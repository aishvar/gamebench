This is somewhat unlikely, as the probability of exactly two 3s in an 8-digit random hand is modest, and the chance of 3 or more is even lower. Given this, challenging the bid is strategically sound because it is more probable that Player 0 overestimated the total count of 3s.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
