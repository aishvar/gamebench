Since I know there is at least one zero in total, Player 0's bid of 1 zero is certainly valid. A minimal safe raise would be to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, or to increase the quantity. The next valid bids after '1 0s' would be '1 1s', '1 2s', ..., or '2 0s'. I have two 7s in my hand, so a strong incremental bid would be '2 7s', which is quite plausible. However, a conservative and safe increment is to bid '1 3s' since I have one 3, and it's a minimal legal raise. To maintain strategic pressure, I'll bid '1 3s'.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 1 3\"\n}",
