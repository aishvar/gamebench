        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 0s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and considering my hand, bidding a higher quantity of '0s' seems risky without more information. However, I can try to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same or increase the quantity with a lower digit. Considering the bid history and my hand, increasing the digit seems more feasible. The next higher digit after '0' is '1', but I should consider the likelihood of '1's based on my hand and the fact that I've already seen bids for '2s', '3s', and '9s'. My hand contains two '2s' but no '1s'. Given this, and aiming for a conservative yet strategic bid, I could consider bidding on a digit that is higher than '0' but not as high as '9', considering the bids already made. However, since I don't have any '1s' and the bid history doesn't give strong evidence for a high count of '1s', and given that '4' is a relatively high quantity, I should be cautious. A safer approach might be to challenge the current bid, given that '4 0s' might be a bit high considering the distribution of digits we've seen so far and the fact that I only have one '0' in my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
