You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I'm Player 0, and it's my turn. The current bid is None, so I need to make the first bid. My hand is 69923588. Let me count the digits. \n\nLooking at my hand: 6, 9, 9, 2, 3, 5, 8, 8. So I have two 9s, two 8s, and one each of 6, 2, 3, 5. \n\nSince there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total digits in play are 16. The maximum possible for any digit is 16, but that's only if all 16 digits are the same, which is very unlikely. \n\nAs the first bid, I want to start with something that's possible but not too high. My highest counts are 9s and 8s, each with two. But since I can bid on any digit, maybe pick a digit I have at least one of. For example, I have two 9s, so if I bid on 9s, I can say 2 9s. But that's the minimum. However, since I need to make a bid that's higher than None, any initial bid is allowed. Wait, no. The rules say the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'. Wait, how does that work? Since the current bid is None, the first player can bid any quantity and digit. Wait, no, the rules say \"Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" Hmm, but how is 'None' compared? Maybe the first bid can be any valid bid, since there's nothing to compare. Wait, maybe the rules mean that the first bid is allowed to be any, because there's no previous bid. So the first player can start with any bid.\n\nWait, the rules state: \"Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" But since there's no previous bid, maybe the first bid can be anything. Because 'None' is considered as the lowest possible, so any bid is higher. So for example, if the first player bids 1 0s, that's allowed. Then the next player has to bid higher than that. \n\nSo my strategy here is to start with a bid that's reasonable based on my hand. Since I have two 9s and two 8s, but also other digits. Let's think about the possible total. If I have two 9s, the other player could have 0 to 8 9s. So the total could be between 2 and 10. But realistically, the other player probably has 1 or 2, so maybe 3 or 4 total. \n\nBut since it's the first bid, I don't want to go too high. Let me start with a low bid that I can support. For example, 2 9s. But maybe I can start a bit higher. Wait, but if I bid 2 9s, the next player can challenge, and if the total is exactly 2, I win. But if they have more, then I might lose. Alternatively, I could bid higher. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps start with a higher digit. Since the bid can be on any digit, maybe choose a higher digit to make it harder for the opponent to raise. For example, if I bid 2 9s, the next player can either bid 3 of any digit, or 2 of a higher digit (like 2 10s, but digits are 0-9). Wait, digits are 0-9, so the highest digit is 9. So if I bid 2 9s, the next player can only bid higher by increasing the quantity (like 3 of any digit) or same quantity with a higher digit, but since 9 is the highest digit, they can't. So they have to bid 3 of any digit. \n\nWait, the rules say: \"Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\" So 2 9s can only be followed by a higher quantity (like 3 of any digit) because 9 is the highest digit. So if I start with 2 9s, the next player must bid at least 3 of any digit. That might be a good strategy. \n\nAlternatively, if I start with a lower digit but higher quantity. For example, 3 8s. But I only have two 8s. The opponent might have more, but that's a risk. Or maybe 2 8s. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, since I have two 9s, I can start with 2 9s. That way, if the opponent challenges, and the total is at least 2, I win. But since I have two, and the opponent could have any number, but the minimum total is 2. So if they challenge, I win. So that's a safe bid. But if they bid higher, like 3 of some digit, then I have to consider. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher quantity on a lower digit. For example, 3 5s. I have one 5. So total would be 1 plus whatever the opponent has. If they have 2, total is 3, which meets the bid. But if they have less, then maybe not. But starting with 3 5s could be risky. \n\nAlternatively, since I have two 9s and two 8s, maybe bid 2 8s. Then the opponent might have some 8s. But it's safer. \n\nWait, but the first bid can be anything. Maybe the best approach is to start with a bid that's possible based on my hand and not too high. For example, 2 9s. That way, even if the opponent has none, the total is 2, which matches the bid. So if they challenge, I win. But if they don't, they have to bid higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher quantity. For example, 4 5s. But I have only one 5. So the opponent would need 3 to make it true. That's possible but risky. \n\nBut as the first bid, it's better to start with something safe. So 2 9s seems safe. Alternatively, 2 8s. Let me check my hand again: I have two 8s. So if I bid 2 8s, the total could be 2 plus the opponent's 8s. If they have at least one, then the total is 3 or more. But if they have none, then the total is 2, which meets the bid. So bidding 2 8s is also safe. \n\nWait, the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So if I bid 2 8s, and the total is exactly 2, then it's valid. So even if the opponent has none, my two 8s make the total 2, so the bid is correct. Therefore, any bid that's equal to the number in my hand is safe, because even if the opponent has none, the total is at least my count. \n\nSo for example, if I have two 9s, bidding 2 9s is safe. Because the total can't be less than 2. So that's a guaranteed safe bid. Similarly, bidding 2 8s is also safe. \n\nBut perhaps starting with a higher digit is better. Because if I bid 2 9s, the next player can only bid higher quantity (since 9 is the highest digit). So they have to bid 3 of any digit. If I bid 2 8s, the next player can bid 2 9s, which is higher digit, same quantity. So maybe starting with a higher digit is better to limit the opponent's options. \n\nSo between 2 8s and 2 9s, choosing 2 9s is better because it forces the next player to increase the quantity. \n\nTherefore, the best initial bid would be 2 9s. That's safe and strategic.\n"
