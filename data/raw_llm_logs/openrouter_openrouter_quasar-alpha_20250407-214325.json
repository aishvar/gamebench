However, since I have 2 out of 8 possible 8s, the likelihood that Player 0 has at least one 8 is moderate but not guaranteed. Player 0 is naive and might be bluffing or overestimating. The total number of 8s could be 2 or 3, but pushing beyond 3 would be risky. A higher bid would require calling at least 4 of some digit, which seems unlikely with my hand only supporting 2 8s and 2 7s. Given the current bid of 3 8s and my knowledge, challenging is the best move since the probability Player 0 has 1 or more 8s is not high enough to confidently bid higher.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
