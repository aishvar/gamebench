For the bid to be true, the opponent (Player 0) needs to have at least one '4' in their 8-digit hand. This is statistically quite likely (expected value is 0.8 fours in 8 digits). Therefore, challenging the bid '2 4s' is risky and likely to fail. I should look for a higher bid. I need to bid higher than '2 4s', either by increasing the quantity or the digit. Looking at my hand, I have two '6's. Bidding '2 6s' is higher than '2 4s' (same quantity, higher digit). Since I hold two '6's myself, this bid is guaranteed to be true based on my hand alone, regardless of the opponent's hand. This is a safe and strategically sound move that increases the bid value.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 6s\"\n}\n```",
