You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. It's the start of the game, and the current bid is None. That means I need to make the first bid. My hand is 87701243. Let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\nLooking at my hand digits: 8, 7, 7, 0, 1, 2, 4, 3. So, breaking it down:\n\n0: 1\n1: 1\n2: 1\n3: 1\n4: 1\n7: 2\n8: 1\n\nThe most frequent digit in my hand is 7, with two of them. Since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total possible digits in the game are 16. But since I don't know the opponent's hand, I should start with a conservative bid based on my own cards. \n\nSince the first bid has to be higher than None, which essentially means any valid bid. The lowest possible bid would be 1 of any digit. But since I have two 7s, maybe I can start with that. For example, if I bid two 7s, but I need to consider that the other player might have more. But since it's the first bid, maybe starting with a higher quantity but lower digit, or a lower quantity but higher digit. Wait, the rules say the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid, but since current bid is None, any bid is allowed. Wait, no\u2014the problem says \"Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" Wait, how does that work? Because None isn't a bid, so maybe the first player can bid anything. Wait, looking back at the rules: \"A bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" Oh, perhaps that's a typo, but maybe it means that the first bid can be any valid bid, as there's nothing to compare. Wait, the example given in the first example has a current bid of \"3 5s\" and the response is to bid \"4 6s\". So perhaps when the current bid is None, the first bid can be any quantity and digit. Wait, but the rules say \"Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" But how can a bid be higher than None? Maybe the initial bid can be anything, and subsequent bids must be higher. Alternatively, perhaps the 'None' is considered as 0 of 0s, so any bid higher than 0 of 0s would be valid. For example, a bid of 1 0s would be higher than 0 0s. But maybe the initial bid can be any bid.\n\nIn any case, since it's the first move, I can choose any quantity and digit. The strategy here is to start with a bid that's reasonable based on my hand but not too high to be immediately challenged. Since I have two 7s, perhaps I can start by bidding two 7s. Alternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, bid 1 of 8. But the digit in the bid can be from 0-9. Since higher digits are better in case of same quantity, maybe starting with a higher digit. But the quantity is more important. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the opponent has 8 digits, perhaps the total number of 7s could be 2 (mine) plus whatever they have. If I bid two 7s, the opponent might have 0, making the total 2, which would make my bid correct. But if they have one or more, then the total is higher. But since I have two, maybe bidding two is safe. However, the opponent might challenge if they have none, but that's a risk. Alternatively, maybe start with a higher quantity. Wait, but if I bid two 7s, that's a low quantity. Maybe starting with a higher quantity but a lower digit. For example, say three 0s. But I only have one 0. So that might not be a good idea. \n\nAlternatively, since the highest possible quantity is 16 (all digits the same), but that's impossible here. So the best approach is to base the bid on the most frequent digit in my hand, which is 7 with two. So bid two 7s. Alternatively, maybe bid a higher digit. For example, bid one 8. Then the next player has to bid higher than that, which would be either two of any digit or one of a higher digit than 8 (which is 9). But if I have an 8, maybe the opponent has some 8s as well, but I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, starting with a lower digit but higher quantity. For example, bid three 0s. But I have only one 0. The opponent could have two, making the total three. But that's a gamble. Since I have one, maybe the total is at least one, so bidding two 0s would be safer. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, the first bid can be anything, but the next player has to bid higher. So maybe starting with a bid that's not too aggressive. For example, bid two 7s. That way, if the opponent has at least one 7, the total is three, which would make my bid correct. If they have none, the total is two, which still meets my bid. Wait, no: the bid is the quantity, so if I bid two 7s, the total needs to be at least two. Since I have two, even if the opponent has none, the total is two, which meets the bid. So my bid would be safe. But if I bid two 7s, the opponent could challenge, and if the total is exactly two, I win. So that's a safe bid. But maybe I can bid higher. For example, since I have two 7s, the opponent could have up to 8 digits, so maybe they have one or two more. So the total could be up to four. But I can't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, bid one 8. Then the next player has to either bid two of any digit or bid one 9. If they don't have any 9s, they might have to bid higher quantity. But if they have a 9, they can bid one 9, which is higher. \n\nBut considering that higher digits are better in same quantity bids, maybe starting with a higher digit is better. Let me see: in my hand, the highest digit is 8. So if I bid one 8, the opponent might have one or more 8s. But I have one, so the total is at least one. So that's a safe bid. But maybe that's too low. \n\nAlternatively, bid two 8s. But I only have one 8. So if I bid two 8s, the total would be at least one (mine), but the opponent might have one or more. If they have one, the total is two, which meets the bid. If they have none, then the total is one, which is less than two, so if they challenge, I lose. So that's risky. \n\nSo perhaps the safest initial bid is to bid the quantity equal to the number in my hand for the most frequent digit. Since I have two 7s, bid two 7s. That way, even if the opponent has none, the total is two, which meets the bid. So I can't lose if I bid two 7s. Because the total would be at least two. So that's a safe opening bid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid a higher quantity but lower digit. For example, three 5s. But I have no 5s in my hand. So that's risky because I have zero, and the opponent might have three, but that's unlikely. Probably not a good idea. \n\nSo the best choice is to bid two 7s. That's a safe bid, as the minimum total is two (my two 7s), so even if challenged, the count is at least two, so I win. Therefore, that's a solid opening move.\n"
