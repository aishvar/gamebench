You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. I have the hand 28330749, which are eight digits. Since it's the first move, the current bid is None, so I need to make the initial bid.\n\nFirst, I should look at my hand and see which digits I have. Let me list them out: 2, 8, 3, 3, 0, 7, 4, 9. So, the digits present are 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9. The counts in my hand are: 0 appears once, 2 once, 3 twice, 4 once, 7 once, 8 once, 9 once.\n\nSince I'm starting, I can choose any digit and quantity. But I need to think about what's likely in the other player's hand. There are 16 digits in total (8 each), so the maximum possible count for any digit is 16.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 3s. That's a decent count. Maybe I can bid on that. If I bid 2 3s, I'm saying there are at least two 3s in total. But since it's the first bid, I could also consider a higher digit to make my bid stronger.\n\nWait, but the rules say that each bid must be strictly higher than the previous. Since this is the first bid, I can choose any quantity and digit. However, choosing a higher digit might be safer because it's harder for the opponent to have a higher digit without a higher quantity.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a lower digit but with a higher quantity. For example, if I bid 3 0s, but I only have one 0, so that's risky. Similarly, 2 3s seems safer because I already have two, so at least two exist.\n\nBut maybe I can go higher. Let's think: if I bid 3 3s, that would mean I'm claiming there are at least three 3s in total. I have two, so the opponent would need at least one. That's possible, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to start with a safer bid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit, like 1 9s. That's a low quantity but a high digit. But since it's the first bid, that might be too low. The opponent can easily outbid me by going higher in quantity or digit.\n\nWait, the initial bid doesn't have to be high, but it's better to set a reasonable bar. So, perhaps starting with a bid that's likely to be true but also gives me some room. For example, 2 3s is a good start because I have two, and the other player might have one or none.\n\nAnother consideration: if I bid 2 3s, and the opponent has none, then the total is two, so my bid is valid. If they have one, it's three, which is still valid. If they have two, it's four, which would be even better. But if they have none, it's still two, which is exactly my bid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of. Wait, I have two 3s, which is the highest count in my hand. So, that's the best candidate for a bid.\n\nSo, I think I'll go with 2 3s. That's a reasonable starting bid, and it's based on my actual hand. It gives the opponent the opportunity to either increase the quantity or the digit, but it's a solid foundation.\n"
