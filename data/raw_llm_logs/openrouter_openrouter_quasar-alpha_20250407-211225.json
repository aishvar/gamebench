Since I have no zeros, the entire validity of the bid depends on whether Player 0 has at least one zero. It is quite probable that Player 0 has at least one zero among their eight digits, as the chance of zero zeros in 8 digits is (9/10)^8 \u2248 43%, so more than half the time they will have at least one zero. Therefore, challenging now is risky. The safest move is to increase the bid incrementally.
