The current bid is trying to claim there are 3 fives in total. Given that I only have 3 fives and the other player could have at most 8 fives (if all their digits were 5, which is unlikely), I need to assess if I can make a higher bid or challenge. Since I have a total of 3 fives, bidding a higher quantity of a different digit or the same digit could be risky without knowing the other player's hand. However, I can see there's potential for challenging since the bid seems high given my hand and the limited number of digits.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
