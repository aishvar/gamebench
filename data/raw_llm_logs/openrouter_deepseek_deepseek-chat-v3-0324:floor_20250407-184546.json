However, since I have none, the likelihood of Player 0 having exactly two 7s is moderate, but not certain. To play strategically, I can either challenge the bid if I believe it's unlikely or make a higher bid to keep the game going. Since the current bid is relatively low (2 of a digit), it's safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I can bid on a digit that I have in my hand to increase the chances of the bid being valid. For example, I have two 2s in my hand, so bidding '3 2s' would be a reasonable move, but since the digit must be higher than the current bid's digit (7), I need to bid on a digit higher than 7. The next available digit is 8, which I have one of in my hand. Bidding '3 8s' is a safe move because even if Player 0 has zero 8s, the total would be 1 (from my hand), making the bid invalid, but since the bid is higher in quantity, it's a valid move. Alternatively, I could bid on a higher digit like 9, but I have none in my hand, so that would be riskier. Therefore, the best move is to bid '3 8s'.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 8s\"\n}\n```",
