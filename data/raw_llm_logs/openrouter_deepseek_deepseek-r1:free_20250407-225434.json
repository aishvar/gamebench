You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. My hand is 62076815. So I need to figure out how many 8s I have. Looking at my digits: 6, 2, 0, 7, 6, 8, 1, 5. Oh, there's one 8 here. The current bid is 3 8s from Player 0. \n\nNow, the total number of digits in the game is 16 (each player has 8). So if I have one 8, Player 0 could have up to 7 more digits. But the bid is 3 8s. So Player 0 is claiming there are at least three 8s in total. Since I have one, they would need at least two more in their hand. \n\nBut wait, Player 0 initially bid 2 8s, then after I bid 3 6s, they upped it to 3 8s. Maybe they have two 8s in their hand, making the total three. But how likely is that? If they have two, then total is three, which meets the bid. But if they have only one, then total is two, which is less than three. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're bluffing. Since I have one, if they have one, total is two, so the bid of 3 8s would be a lie. But if they have two, it's valid. \n\nSo the question is, should I challenge or bid higher. To bid higher, I need to either increase the quantity (like 4 of any digit) or same quantity but higher digit. The current bid is 3 8s. So a higher bid could be 4 of any digit (like 4 0s) or 3 9s. \n\nLooking at my hand again: I have 6, 2, 0, 7, 6, 8, 1, 5. So in my hand, the digits are: 0,1,2,5,6 (two 6s),7,8. So I have one 0, one 1, etc. If I were to bid 3 9s, that's possible, but I have no 9s. So the total could be whatever Player 0 has. But since 9 is higher than 8, a bid of 3 9s would be a valid higher bid. But if Player 0 has no 9s, then the total would be whatever I have (zero) plus theirs. But I have zero 9s. So unless Player 0 has at least three 9s, the total would be less than three. But bidding 3 9s would be a risky move. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 4 of a lower digit, like 4 6s. I have two 6s. If Player 0 has two 6s, that's four total. But the previous bid was 3 6s by me. Then Player 0 bid 3 8s. So maybe they don't have many 6s. If I bid 4 6s, but I only have two, then Player 0 would need to have two more. But if they have, say, one, then total is three, which is less than four. So that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 3 9s. Since 9 is higher than 8, same quantity. But I have no 9s. So unless Player 0 has three 9s, which is possible but maybe unlikely. But if they have three 9s, they might have bid that earlier. \n\nAlternatively, challenge. If I challenge, the total 8s would be my one plus Player 0's. If they have two, total is three, so their bid is valid and I lose. If they have one or zero, then total is two or one, so I win. \n\nSo the risk here is whether Player 0 actually has two 8s. If they do, challenging would make me lose. If they don't, I win. \n\nBut how likely is it that they have two 8s? Since they first bid 2 8s, then after I bid 3 6s, they upped to 3 8s. Maybe they were confident in their 8s. But maybe they were bluffing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have one 8 and are trying to push the bid higher. \n\nGiven that the total possible 8s in the game could be up to 8 (since each player has 8 digits, but it's possible but unlikely). But realistically, having two 8s in their hand would make the total three, which meets the bid. \n\nBut without knowing their hand, it's a gamble. If I challenge, there's a chance I win if they have less than two 8s. If I bid higher, I have to make a bid that's higher than 3 8s. \n\nAnother option is to bid 3 9s. Since 9 is higher than 8, same quantity. But I have no 9s. So the total would be whatever Player 0 has. If they have three 9s, then the bid is valid. But if they have less, then the bid is invalid. But since 9 is a high digit, maybe they don't have many. \n\nAlternatively, bid 4 5s. I have one 5. If Player 0 has three 5s, total is four. But I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, bid 4 0s. I have one 0. Player 0 might have some. \n\nBut all these options are risky. \n\nAlternatively, challenge. Let's think: if I have one 8, and the bid is three 8s, then Player 0 needs at least two. If they have two, total is three. If they have one, total is two. So the challenge's success depends on whether they have two. \n\nGiven that they initially bid 2 8s, maybe they have two. Then when I bid 3 6s, they raised to 3 8s. That could indicate they have two 8s and are confident. But maybe they're bluffing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have one 8 and are trying to get me to challenge. \n\nIt's a tough call. But given that the bid is 3 8s, and I have one, the chance that they have two is possible. But in a game of Liar's Poker, sometimes challenging when you think the bid is too high is the way to go. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have more than two. But with 8 digits, having three 8s in their hand would make the total four. But the bid is three, which would still be valid. \n\nWait, if they have three 8s, total is four (my one plus their three). So the bid is 3, which is still valid. But the bid is 3 8s, which is true. So if they have three, challenging would make me lose. \n\nBut how likely is that? Having three of the same digit in 8 cards is possible but not super common. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have two. Then total is three. \n\nSo the question is, is it more likely that they have two or more 8s, making the bid valid, or less? \n\nIf I challenge and they have two, I lose. If they have one or zero, I win. \n\nBut without knowing, it's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, making a higher bid. Let's see. The current bid is 3 8s. To bid higher, I can either bid 4 of any digit or 3 of a higher digit. \n\nWhat digits do I have? Let's list my digits again: 6,2,0,7,6,8,1,5. So I have two 6s, one 8, and others. \n\nIf I bid 4 6s, that's possible. I have two, so Player 0 would need two more. If they have two, total is four. But if they have one, total is three, which is less than four. \n\nAlternatively, bid 3 9s. I have none, so Player 0 needs three. Unlikely. \n\nBid 3 8s is already the current bid, so I can't. \n\nAlternatively, bid 4 0s. I have one. Player 0 would need three. Possible but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, bid 3 7s. I have one. Player 0 would need two. \n\nBut all these options are risky. \n\nAlternatively, challenge. \n\nGiven that the bid is 3 8s, and I have one, the chance that Player 0 has two or more 8s is the key. If they have two, total is three, which meets the bid. If they have one, total is two, which doesn't. \n\nIn a typical game, players might bid higher on their own hands. Player 0 first bid 2 8s, then after I bid 3 6s, they went to 3 8s. Maybe they have two 8s and are confident. \n\nBut maybe they're bluffing. \n\nIf I challenge and they have two, I lose. If they have one, I win. \n\nIt's a 50-50 chance, but in the absence of more information, perhaps challenging is the better move, especially if I think the bid is on the edge. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should bid higher. For example, 3 9s. Since 9 is higher than 8, same quantity. But I have no 9s. So the total would be whatever Player 0 has. If they have three 9s, then it's valid. But that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, bid 4 6s. I have two, so they need two. If they have two, total is four. But if they have one, total is three. \n\nBut given that I previously bid 3 6s, and they didn't challenge, maybe they have at least one 6. But they might have more. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the safer move is to challenge. If I challenge and lose, the game ends. But if I bid and they challenge, I might lose. \n\nBut given the current bid is 3 8s, and I have one, I think challenging is the better option. Because even if they have two, which is possible, it's a risk, but maybe they're bluffing. \n\nSo I'll go with challenge.\n"
