The expected average for any digit across both hands is roughly 1.6 (since 16 digits / 10 digits \u2248 1.6), so having 3 or more 9s total is above average. Given I have none, it's improbable the total is at least 3. Therefore, the most strategic move is to challenge the bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
