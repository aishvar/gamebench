Since I have none, both 8s would need to be in Player 0\u2019s hand, which is possible but somewhat unlikely given 8 digits. However, it's still plausible, so challenging now may be premature. Instead, I can make a safe higher bid on a digit I have more of. My hand has two 1s, two 1s is equal in quantity but lower digit, so invalid. Next, I have one 4, one 3, one 5, one 7, one 9, so no digit with more than two. To raise, I can bid 3 of any digit. Since I have two 1s, bidding 3 1s is a reasonable next bid, as the opponent might plausibly have one 1. This is a safe incremental raise.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 1s\"\n}",
