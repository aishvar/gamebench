For this bid to be true, there must be at least three '8's across both hands (16 digits total). Since I have one '8', Player 1 must have at least two '8's for their bid to be accurate. Player 1 previously bid '2 8s' and then raised to '3 8s' after my bid of '3 3s'. This repeated bidding on '8's suggests they likely hold at least two '8's, making a challenge risky. Therefore, I should make a higher bid. The next possible bids are '4 8s' (increasing quantity) or '3 9s' (increasing digit). Bidding '4 8s' feels like a significant escalation, requiring Player 1 to have three '8's. A more standard and safer progression is to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same. Bidding '3 9s' is a valid higher bid. I hold one '9', so this bid requires Player 1 to have at least two '9's, which is plausible and puts the pressure back on them.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 9s\"\n}\n```",
