You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm playing Liar's Poker and it's my turn. The current bid is 2 8s from Player 0. I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid.\n\nFirst, looking at my hand: 77248270. Let's count the digits. I have two 7s, two 2s, two 8s, and one 4 and one 0. So, in total, I have two 8s. \n\nSince the current bid is 2 8s, I need to make a bid that's higher. The options are either increasing the quantity or the digit. If I increase the quantity, I could bid 3 8s. But considering that the maximum possible quantity is 16, and there are only two players, each with 8 digits, the total 8s can't exceed 16. However, since I have two 8s, the other player could have up to 14, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, I could increase the digit. For example, bid 2 9s. But I don't have any 9s, so that might be risky. Or maybe bid 2 8s again but that's not higher. Wait, no, the bid has to be strictly higher. So either higher quantity or same quantity with a higher digit.\n\nAnother option is to bid 3 7s. I have two 7s, so maybe the other player has one or two. That could be a safer bet. Or 3 2s, since I have two. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider the likelihood. The current bid is 2 8s. If I have two, the other player could have zero, making the total 2. But if I challenge, I might win if the total is 2. But if the other player has more, I could lose.\n\nAlternatively, making a higher bid could be safer. Let's see: if I bid 3 8s, I'm assuming there's at least one more 8. If the other player has one, the total is 3. If not, I lose. But I don't know their hand.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 9s, which is a higher digit but same quantity. Since I don't have any 9s, that's a risk. Maybe 3 7s is better because I have two, and maybe the other player has one.\n\nWait, but the bid has to be higher than 2 8s. So 2 9s is higher because the digit is higher. But if I have zero 9s, and the other player has none, the total is zero, which is less than 2, so I would lose if challenged.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 8s, which is higher in quantity. If the other player has at least one 8, the total is 3. But if they have none, the total is 2, which is less than my bid, so I would lose.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe challenging is the better option. The current bid is 2 8s. If I challenge, and the total is 2, I win. If it's more, I lose. But considering I have two 8s, the other player could have zero, one, or two. If they have zero, total is 2, I win. If they have one, total is 3, I lose. If they have two, total is 4, I lose. But I don't know their hand. \n\nGiven that, maybe challenging is a risk, but it's possible the total is exactly 2. Alternatively, making a bid that's higher but manageable.\n\nWait, another approach: the maximum possible for 8s is 16, but realistically, since I have two, the other player can have up to 14, but that's unlikely. So 2 8s might be a low bid, but it's also possible they're lying.\n\nI think I'll go with challenging because the current bid is 2 8s, and I have two, so the total could be 2. If the other player has none, I win. It's a gamble, but possible.\n"
