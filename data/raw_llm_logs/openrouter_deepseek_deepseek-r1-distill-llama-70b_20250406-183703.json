You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker situation. So, I'm Player 1, and my hand is 81837677. The current bid is 4 2s from Player 0. I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid.\n\nFirst, I'll look at my own hand to see what digits I have. My hand is 8, 1, 8, 3, 7, 6, 7, 7. So, I have two 8s, one 1, one 3, one 6, and three 7s. That's a total of 8 digits, as each player has 8.\n\nThe current bid is 4 2s. That means Player 0 is claiming that there are at least four 2s in total between both players. But looking at my hand, I don't have any 2s. So, if I were to challenge, the total number of 2s would be whatever Player 0 has. Since I have zero, Player 0 must have at least four 2s. But wait, each player only has 8 digits. If Player 0 has four 2s, that's possible, but it's a significant number.\n\nI should consider the bid history to see the flow. Player 0 started with 2 2s, I responded with 3 7s, and then Player 0 upped it to 4 2s. So, Player 0 is sticking with the 2s and increasing the quantity. Maybe they have multiple 2s, or maybe they're bluffing.\n\nNow, thinking about my options. I can either challenge the 4 2s or make a higher bid. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity beyond 4 or keep the quantity at 4 but choose a higher digit. Since the current digit is 2, any digit from 3 to 9 would be higher. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have three 7s. Bidding 4 7s would be a higher bid because the digit is higher than 2. Alternatively, I could bid 5 of a digit I have more of, but I don't have five of any digit except maybe 7s if Player 0 also has some. But I only have three 7s, so unless Player 0 has at least two 7s, 4 7s might be a safe bid. However, I don't know Player 0's hand, so it's risky.\n\nOn the other hand, challenging the 4 2s could be a good move if I think Player 0 doesn't have enough 2s. Since I have none, Player 0 would need exactly four 2s for the bid to be valid. If they have four, I lose. If they have fewer, I win. But considering that each player has 8 digits, having four of a single digit is possible but not extremely common, especially if the player is trying to bluff.\n\nI need to weigh the probabilities. If I challenge and lose, I lose the game. If I challenge and win, I gain the advantage. Alternatively, if I make a bid, I have to hope that I can either win or force Player 0 into a tough spot.\n\nGiven that I have three 7s, bidding 4 7s might be a safer move. It's a higher digit than 2, so it's a valid bid. Plus, if Player 0 doesn't have many 7s, it might be a good challenge for them. Alternatively, I could go higher, but I don't have enough of any digit to safely go beyond 4.\n\nAnother thought: if I bid 4 7s, and Player 0 has, say, two 7s, then the total would be five, which is more than four, so the bid would hold. But if Player 0 has only one or none, then the total would be three or four, which might not meet the bid. So, it's a bit uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to bid a higher digit with the same quantity, like 4 3s or 4 6s, but I only have one of each. That might be riskier because I don't have as many of those digits.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the best move is to challenge the 4 2s. Since I have zero 2s, Player 0 must have at least four for the bid to be good. But having four 2s is a lot, and maybe Player 0 is bluffing. It's a risk, but given that I don't have a strong bid myself, challenging might be the better option here.\n"
