        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Given that I only have one 5, and considering the bid history where the bids have been relatively conservative, bidding a higher quantity of the same digit or moving to a higher digit seems risky without more information. However, I also have two 9s and a 6, and a 1. Considering the bids have focused on lower digits, I could try to shift the focus to a higher digit that I have a presence in, like the 9s, but since the current bid is on 5s, I need to decide whether to challenge the bid on 5s or try to increase the bid. Given that I have only one 5 and the bid is for three 5s, and knowing that the maximum number of any digit across both hands is 16, it seems plausible that there could be three 5s between both players, especially since Player 1 has bid on 5s twice, indicating they might have a strong presence of 5s. However, without clear evidence of an extremely high likelihood of this bid being true or false based on my hand alone, I must consider the strategic aspect of challenging versus bidding higher. Since my hand does not strongly support bidding higher on 5s, and moving to a different digit might not be as competitive given the current focus on 5s, I will challenge the bid to test Player 1's confidence in their 5s.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
