For the bid to be valid, Player 1 must have at least one 8, or more than one combined. Since I have one 8, it's quite plausible that there is at least one more 8 in Player 1's hand, making the total two or more. Therefore, challenging now is risky. The safest move is to increase the bid. I can do this by either increasing the quantity to 3 of any digit, or bidding 2 of a higher digit than 8, which is 9. Since 9s tend to be rarer, a safer incremental bid is 3 of a digit I have multiple of. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s. So bidding 3 3s is plausible, as with two in my hand, only one more is needed from Player 1, which is likely. Thus, I will bid 3 3s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 3s\"\n}",
