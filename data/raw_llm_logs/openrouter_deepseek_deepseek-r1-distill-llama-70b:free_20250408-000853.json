        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. The game is between me (Player 0) and Player 1. My hand is 26713248. The current bid is None, which means the game is just starting, and I get to make the first bid.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze my hand. My digits are 2, 6, 7, 1, 3, 2, 4, 8. Let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\nLooking at each digit:\n- 0: 0\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 1\n- 4: 1\n- 5: 0\n- 6: 1\n- 7: 1\n- 8: 1\n- 9: 0\n\nSo, the digits I have are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, each appearing once, except for 2, which appears twice. \n\nSince it's the first bid, I can choose any digit and quantity. My goal is to make a bid that's likely to be correct but also gives me an advantage. I want to pick a digit that I have at least one of, so I can have some confidence. \n\nI have two 2s, which is the highest count in my hand. So, maybe I can bid on 2s. Since I have two, I can safely bid at least 2. But I can also consider that the opponent might have more. But since it's the first move, it's better to start with a lower quantity to avoid overbidding.\n\nAlternatively, I could choose another digit I have, like 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, or 8, but I only have one of each. So, if I bid on those, I can only bid 1. Bidding on 2s allows me to bid a higher quantity, which might be better strategically.\n\nSo, I think I'll bid 2 2s. It's a safe bet because I have two, and it's the highest count I have. Plus, it's a low bid, making it harder for the opponent to challenge right away without more information.\n\nI should make sure my bid is valid. Since the current bid is None, any bid is acceptable as long as it's a quantity and a digit. So, \"BID: 2 2s\" is a valid move.\n\nI don't think I should challenge because there's no previous bid to challenge. So, my only option is to make a bid. Therefore, I'll go with 2 2s.\n"
