        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

I have one 6 in my hand. The bid history shows that Player 0 bid 2 5s and then I bid 3 5s. Given that the current bid is 3 6s and I have one 6, I should consider if I can make a valid higher bid or challenge. Since I have one 6 and the bid is 3 6s, I should think about increasing the quantity or the digit. I have a total of 8 digits in my hand, and none of them are higher than 6 in quantity, but I do have a higher digit (9). However, bidding higher than 3 6s requires me to have more 6s or to bid a higher digit with a quantity that seems plausible. I will increase the quantity and bid on a digit I have, which is 6. However, I only have one 6, so bidding more than 3 6s seems risky. I will challenge the bid because I find it unlikely that there are 3 6s in total.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
