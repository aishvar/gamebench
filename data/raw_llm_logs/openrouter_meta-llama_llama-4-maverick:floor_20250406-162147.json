        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '9 0s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

To determine the likelihood of the bid being correct, I need to consider the total count of 0s. Since there are 16 digits in total and I have one 0, there are 8 other digits. Player 0 could have at most 8 0s, making the total count at most 9 (1 from me + 8 from Player 0). The bid of 9 0s is possible but on the higher end. However, given the bid history, it seems Player 0 is trying to bluff or has a strong hand in 0s and 5s initially, then switched to 0s. I should challenge the bid if I think it's unlikely. Given that I have one 0 and the maximum count is 9, and considering the aggressive bidding pattern of Player 0, it's plausible they have 8 0s. I will challenge the bid because it's a high quantity and my hand doesn't strongly support it, but the history suggests it might not be a bluff.\", \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"}",
