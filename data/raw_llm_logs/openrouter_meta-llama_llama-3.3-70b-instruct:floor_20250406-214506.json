        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since the bid is on the quantity of 6s and considering my hand, bidding higher on the same digit or increasing the digit seems risky without more information about Player 1's hand. However, since I only have one 6, and the total number of 6s must be at least 4 for the bid to be valid, I need to consider the likelihood of Player 1 having at least three 6s. Given that each player has 8 digits, and without knowing Player 1's hand, it's possible but not guaranteed that they have three 6s. An alternative is to bid on a different digit where I might have an advantage or more certainty. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s and other digits. Bidding on 9s could be advantageous since I already have two, but I must bid higher than '4 6s'. The next logical step is to either challenge the current bid if I think it's unlikely or bid on a digit where I have a stronger presence. Considering my hand and the need to bid higher, challenging seems less favorable without a strong indication that the bid is incorrect. Thus, I should look for a digit in my hand that allows me to bid higher in terms of quantity or digit value. Since '4 6s' is the current bid, and I have two 9s, bidding '4 9s' would be a valid higher bid because it maintains the same quantity but increases the digit value, which is a strategic move based on the information I have.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 5 9s\"\n}",
