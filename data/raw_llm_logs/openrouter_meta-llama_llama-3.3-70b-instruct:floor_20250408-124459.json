        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 4s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Notably, I have no 4s, which makes the current bid of '3 4s' somewhat suspicious since I don't contribute to this count at all. However, without knowing the other player's hand, it's hard to assess the likelihood of this bid being true. Considering my options for bidding higher, I could try to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 7s, which is higher than the current digit of 4, and given that the current quantity is 3, a reasonable bid could be to increase the quantity of a higher digit that I have, or match the digit but increase the quantity if I had enough of the current digit or a lower one. Given my hand and the need to make a strictly higher bid, I could consider bidding on a digit I have in abundance or try to challenge if the bid seems unlikely. However, challenging seems risky without more information about the opponent's hand. Given that I have two 7s and no 4s, and considering the rules that allow bidding on any digit, a safer approach might be to utilize the information I have about my hand to make an informed bid. Since I don't have enough information to comfortably challenge the bid of '3 4s' and given that my hand does contain higher digits than 4, I should look for an opportunity to bid on those. But, considering the bid history and my hand, a more strategic move might involve using the digits I have to my advantage while also considering the potential distribution of digits in the other player's hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 7s\"\n}",
