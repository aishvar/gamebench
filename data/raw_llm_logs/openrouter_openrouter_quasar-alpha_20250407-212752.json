Since I can see only one zero, the opponent must have at least two zeros for their bid to be true. Given that two zeros in their hand is plausible but not guaranteed, I need to assess the likelihood. Statistically, the chance of them having two or more zeros in eight digits is moderate (~35%). Since it's not extremely unlikely, a challenge is risky. To stay in the game strategically, I will raise the bid modestly. My hand has three '9's, so a bid of 4 9s is valid and beats the current bid (since 4 > 3). This also pressures the opponent and leverages my strong count of 9s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 9\"\n}",
