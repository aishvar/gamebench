        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

The current bid is \\'3 6s\\', meaning Player 0 is claiming there are at least 3 sixes in total between our hands. Since I have zero 6s in my hand, all 3 claimed 6s would have to be in Player 0\\'s hand. While this is possible, it would mean Player 0 has 3 out of their 8 digits as 6s, which is somewhat concentrated. Looking at the bid history, Player 0 initially bid on 2s, then raised to 3 2s after I bid 3 1s. I have one 2 in my hand, so Player 0\\'s claim of at least 2 more 2s in their hand seems reasonable. However, the jump to 6s without any previous bidding on that digit feels like it could be a bluff. To make a higher bid, I could bid \\'4 6s\\', but that would be risky since I have no 6s. I could bid \\'3 7s\\', which I know is true since I have one 7. I could also bid \\'3 8s\\' or \\'3 9s\\', with \\'3 9s\\' being safer since I have one 9. Given the information, I\\'ll bid \\'3 9s\\' which is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit) and I know it\\'s at least partially supported by my hand.\", \"action\": \"BID: 3 9s\"}', type='text')"
