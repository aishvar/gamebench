In my hand, I have one 7. For the bid to be valid, there must be at least one more 7 in Player 1's hand. While this is possible, it's also plausible that Player 1 is bluffing, as they only need to convince me that their bid is reasonable. However, since the bid of 2 7s is not overly ambitious (it doesn't approach the upper limit of 16), it's safer for me to raise the bid rather than challenge at this point. To maintain pressure and explore the strength of Player 1's hand, I will bid 2 9s, which increases the digit while keeping the quantity the same.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 9s\"\n}\n```",
