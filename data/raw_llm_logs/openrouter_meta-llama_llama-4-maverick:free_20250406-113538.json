        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 4 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '8 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 32 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.",

The bid of 8 5s implies that at least 8 out of 32 digits are 5s. Since I have 2 fives, the remaining players must have at least 6 fives between them. This is plausible but I should consider my next move carefully. I can either challenge or make a higher bid. A higher bid could be either increasing the quantity or keeping the quantity the same and increasing the digit. I see that I have no 9s, so bidding 8 9s is not possible. However, I can bid 9 5s or 8 6s. Since I have two 8s, bidding 8 8s could be a good option as it increases the digit. I will choose to bid 8 6s as it is a higher bid than 8 5s and I have some information about the distribution of digits.\", \"action\": \"BID: 8 6s\"}",
