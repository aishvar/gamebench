        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. It's my turn, and I have the hand 88575981. The current bid is None, which means I need to make the first bid. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have the digits: 8, 8, 5, 7, 5, 9, 8, 1. Let me count how many of each digit I have. There are three 8s, two 5s, and one each of 7, 9, and 1. \n\nSince I'm starting, I need to make a bid that's as high as possible but still believable. I should consider the total number of digits in play, which is 16 (8 from each player). If I bid too high, the other player might challenge me, and I could lose if the actual count doesn't meet my bid.\n\nI have three 8s, so maybe I can bid on 8s. If I bid 3 8s, that's a good start. But wait, the other player might have some 8s too. The maximum possible is 16, so if I bid 3, it's possible that the total is higher. However, since I'm starting, I need to set a base that's hard to challenge. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should bid on a digit that's less common. Looking at my hand, I have two 5s. Maybe I can bid 2 5s. But that's lower than the three 8s I have. \n\nWait, the rules say that each bid must be strictly higher than the previous. Since there's no previous bid, I can choose any quantity and digit. So, I should choose the highest possible bid that I'm confident about. \n\nConsidering my three 8s, I can safely bid 3 8s because even if the other player has none, the total is 3, which meets my bid. If they have some, the total could be higher, but I'm starting, so it's a reasonable bid. \n\nI think bidding 3 8s is a solid move. It's based on my hand, and it's a good starting point without being too high. The other player would have to either bid higher or challenge. If they challenge and the total is 3 or more, I win. If it's less, I lose, but since I have three, it's unlikely the total is less. \n\nSo, I'll go with bidding 3 8s.\n"
