You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

Given there are 16 total digits (8 per player), there's a reasonable chance the opponent has at least one 5, making a total of 2.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I'm Player 0 with the hand 9,5,6,4,7,3,2,1. The current bid is None, so I need to make the opening bid. Since there are no previous bids, I can start with any valid bid. My goal is to set a bid that's plausible but also gives me some advantage.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have one of each digit from 1-9 except for 0. So, the digits in my hand are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9. Each appears once. Since there's a total of 16 digits in play (8 per player), the possible counts for any digit could be up to 16, but realistically, considering both players, maybe 2-3 of a common digit.\n\nSince I have one 5, maybe I can bid on 5s. But since I have only one, the opponent might have 0 or 1. So a bid of 2 5s would be possible. Alternatively, looking at my hand, maybe a lower digit like 3 or 4. Wait, but starting with a lower quantity might be safer. But since the first bid can be anything, maybe I should start with a low quantity. For example, 2 of a digit. Let me check which digit in my hand is more likely to have duplicates in the opponent's hand. \n\nDigits like 5, 6, or 7 might be more common. But without any information, it's a bit of a guess. Alternatively, starting with a higher digit to make the next player have to bid higher. For instance, if I bid 2 5s, the next player has to either bid higher quantity or higher digit. But since 2 is the quantity, they could go to 3 of a lower digit, but digits go from 0-9, so higher digit is 6,7,8,9. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting with a higher digit like 9, since I have one 9. If I bid 1 9s, but wait, the bid has to be higher than None. Wait, the first bid can be any valid. But the rules say the first bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'. Wait, how does that work? Since None is the starting bid, the first player can make any bid, because any bid is higher than None. So I can start with any quantity and digit. But the example shows that when the current bid is None, the first bid is 3 5s, so maybe the first bid is just whatever the player chooses. So I need to pick a bid that's a good starting point.\n\nConsidering that each player has 8 digits, and the total is 16. The average count for any digit would be 1.6 (16/10 digits). So a bid of 2 of a digit is reasonable. Let's pick a digit I have, so I can at least contribute one. For example, if I bid 2 5s, since I have one 5, the opponent might have at least one. If they don't, then the total is 1, which would make the bid invalid if challenged. But since it's the first bid, maybe starting with 2 of a digit I have is safer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting with a higher digit to force the opponent to bid higher. For example, if I bid 2 9s. I have one 9, so the opponent would need to have at least one more. If they don't, then the total is 1, which is below 2. But that's risky. Alternatively, a middle digit like 5 or 6.\n\nWait, the safest opening bid is usually 2 of a digit that you have at least one of. So maybe pick a digit that's common. Let's see my hand: 9,5,6,4,7,3,2,1. No duplicates. So all my digits are single. So if I bid 2 5s, I have one, and the opponent might have one. So total 2, which meets the bid. But if the opponent has none, then total is 1, which would lose if challenged. Alternatively, maybe bid 2 of a lower digit, but I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 3 of a digit. For example, 3 2s. I have one 2, so opponent would need two. That's possible but maybe less likely. But if I start with 3, the next player has to bid higher. But 3 is a higher quantity. So maybe starting with 2 is safer.\n\nAnother angle: the sum of all digits in the game is 16, so if I bid a higher digit, like 9, even with a quantity of 2, the opponent might not have any, making it risky. Whereas a lower digit like 3 or 4 might be more common. Wait, but digits are 0-9, and 0 is a possible digit. Wait, the user's hand doesn't have a 0, but the opponent might. So maybe 0s are in play. So if I bid 2 0s, but I have none, but the opponent might have 2. That's possible. But since I have no 0s, it's risky. So better to bid on a digit I have at least one of.\n\nSo, possible options:\n\n- 2 5s (I have 1, opponent might have 1)\n- 2 6s (I have 1)\n- 2 3s (I have 1)\n- etc.\n\nAlternatively, 1 of a higher digit. Wait, but the first bid can be any. For example, 1 9s. But if I bid 1 9s, the opponent can challenge, and since I have one, if they have none, total is 1, which meets the bid. So that's safe. But maybe that's too low, allowing the opponent to bid higher. Wait, but the next player has to bid higher than 1 9s. So they could bid 2 of any digit, or 1 of a higher digit (but 9 is the highest, so that's not possible). Wait, digits go up to 9, so the highest digit is 9. So if I bid 1 9s, the next player can't bid a higher digit. They have to bid a higher quantity. So they would have to bid 2 of any digit. For example, 2 0s. That's a possibility.\n\nBut if I start with 1 9s, and the opponent has no 9s, then the total is 1, which is correct. But if they have one, total is 2. So my bid is 1, which is correct. So challenging that would fail. So 1 9s is a safe bid. But maybe it's better to start with a higher quantity to make the opponent's options harder.\n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 5s, the opponent can either bid 3 of any digit or 2 of a higher digit. But 5 is mid-range, so higher digits are 6-9. If the opponent has a higher digit, they can bid 2 6s, which is higher than 2 5s. But if they don't have many 6s, they might have to challenge.\n\nBut since it's the first move, maybe starting with a moderate bid. Let's say I have one 5. Bidding 2 5s. If the opponent has at least one, the bid is valid. If they have none, then it's one, which would make the bid invalid. But since I don't know their hand, it's a gamble. But statistically, there are 8 digits in their hand. The chance they have at least one 5 is 1 - (9/10)^8 \u2248 1 - 0.43 = 0.57, so about 57% chance they have at least one 5. So there's a 57% chance the total is 2, which meets the bid, and 43% chance it's 1, which would lose if challenged. But since it's the first bid, the opponent might not challenge immediately, so I can start with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 3s. I have one 3. Same logic as 5. Or 2 6s. Which is better? Maybe pick a middle digit to make it harder for the opponent to bid higher digits. For example, 2 5s. Then the opponent can bid 2 6s, 2 7s, etc., but if they don't have those, they have to increase the quantity. Alternatively, if I bid 2 9s, which I have one, and the opponent might have one, but 9 is a higher digit. If they have none, then total is 1, which is less than 2. So that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a bid that's more likely to be true. For example, 2 of a digit that's more common. But I don't know the opponent's digits. Wait, in the absence of information, perhaps the best is to bid a digit I have and a quantity that's possible. Since I have one, 2 is possible if the opponent has at least one. So 2 of a digit I have. Let's pick 5. So the action would be \"BID: 2 5s\".\n"
