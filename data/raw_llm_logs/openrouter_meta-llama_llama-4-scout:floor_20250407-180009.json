My hand contains the digits: 8, 8, 2, 1, 4, 7, 8, 0. I have a total of 3 '8's, 1 '2', 1 '1', 1 '4', 1 '7', and 1 '0'. Since the bid is on the count of '5's and I do not have any '5's in my hand, I can only rely on the information from my hand to make a decision. The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and since there are only 2 players, the current bid of '2 5s' could potentially be valid or not, depending on Player 0's hand. However, I can see if I can make a higher bid with a digit I have. I have 3 '8's which is more than the current bid of 2 '5's. Thus, I can make a bid of '3 8s' which would be higher than '2 5s'.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 8s\"\n}\n```",
