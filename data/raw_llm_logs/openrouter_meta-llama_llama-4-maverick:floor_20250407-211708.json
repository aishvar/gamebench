I count the occurrences of '1' in my hand, which is 0. Since there are 2 players and each has 8 digits, the total count of '1s' across both hands can't exceed 16. The current bid is 2, which is relatively low. I see that I have 0 '1s', so the total count of '1s' is at least 2 (from Player 0's hand). I can either challenge or bid higher. Bidding higher could be '3 1s' or '2 0s' (since 0 is the next lower digit and my hand has several other digits). However, given that the bid is not extremely high and I have no '1s', I will bid higher on a different digit. I count my digits: 6 appears 3 times, 2 appears 2 times, 7 appears 2 times, 8 appears 1 time, and 0 appears 1 time. I can bid '2 0s' as it's a valid higher bid than '2 1s' because it is on a lower digit.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 0s\"\n}\n```",
