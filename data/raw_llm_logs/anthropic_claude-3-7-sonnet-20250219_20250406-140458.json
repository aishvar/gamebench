        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 3 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 7s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 24 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

The current bid claims there are at least 4 sevens total. Since I have none, all 4 would need to be distributed between the other two players\\' hands. This is possible but not guaranteed. Let me analyze further: I\\'ve already revealed I had at least one 6 with my earlier bid. Player 2 then bid 3 7s, suggesting they might have at least one 7. Player 0 then raised to 4 7s, which could mean they have multiple 7s or are bluffing. Given that I have no 7s and the bid is still relatively low (only 4 out of a possible 24 digits), I think it\\'s safer to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I could bid \\'4 8s\\' or \\'5 0s\\'. Since I have one 0, one 3, two 3s, and one 9 in my hand, bidding \\'5 0s\\' seems riskier than \\'4 8s\\'.
