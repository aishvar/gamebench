You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. The current bid is None, which means I get to start the bidding. My hand is 96306890. Let me think about what to do.\n\nFirst, I should look at my own digits. Breaking it down, I have: 9, 6, 3, 0, 6, 8, 9, 0. So, let's count each digit.\n\n- 0: I have two of them.\n- 3: One.\n- 6: Two.\n- 8: One.\n- 9: Two.\n\nSo, my digits are 0, 3, 6, 8, 9, each with counts as above. Now, since the total number of digits between both players is 16 (each has 8), the maximum any digit can have is 16, but realistically, it's much lower.\n\nSince the current bid is None, I can choose any digit and quantity. I want to make a bid that's reasonable but also gives me a good chance of winning if challenged. Alternatively, I could make a bid that's likely to be higher than the opponent's possible bid.\n\nLooking at my digits, I have two 0s. So, if I bid on 0s, maybe 2 0s. But wait, is that the best? Let's see. If I bid 2 0s, the opponent might have more, but since I have two, the total could be up to whatever they have plus mine.\n\nAlternatively, I have two 6s. Maybe I can bid 2 6s. Or perhaps go higher. But since I don't know the opponent's hand, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nWait, the maximum I can bid is based on what I have plus what I think the opponent might have. For example, if I have two 0s, the opponent could have up to 6 more (since 8 digits each, but they might have other digits). But that's a lot. So, maybe 2 0s is safe, but perhaps I can go higher.\n\nAlternatively, I have two 9s. So, maybe I can bid 2 9s. Or maybe even 3, assuming the opponent has at least one. But that's risky because if they don't have any, the total would be only 2, and I'd lose if someone challenges.\n\nHmm. Since it's the first bid, I don't want to go too high. Maybe I should start with a lower bid to test the waters. Let's think about which digit is more likely to have a higher count.\n\n0s are common in some cases, but maybe not as much as other digits. 6s and 9s could be decent. Alternatively, I could choose a digit I have multiple of and bid that.\n\nWait, I have two 0s, two 6s, and two 9s. So, any of those could be a starting point. Let me pick one. Maybe 2 0s. Or perhaps 2 6s. Or maybe 2 9s.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid higher on a digit I have more of. But I don't have more than two of any digit. So, the maximum I can bid with confidence is 2 of a digit. But maybe I can bid 3, hoping the opponent has at least one.\n\nWait, but if I bid 3 of a digit and the opponent has none, then I lose. So, maybe it's safer to bid 2 of a digit I have two of. Let's go with that.\n\nSo, I can choose any of the digits I have two of. Let's pick 0s. So, I'll bid 2 0s. That's a safe start. Alternatively, I could bid 2 6s or 2 9s. Let me think which is better.\n\nIf I bid 2 0s, and the opponent has, say, one 0, then the total is 3, which is higher than my bid, so I win. If they have none, then it's exactly 2, so I still win. If they have more, like two, then total is 4, which is still higher than my bid. So, 2 0s seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 6s, same logic applies. But maybe 0s are less likely to be bid higher, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but the opponent could have more of a certain digit. For example, if they have three 5s, they might bid higher. But since I don't know, I have to make a choice based on my hand.\n\nI think I'll go with 2 0s. So, the action would be BID: 2 0s.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user had 96306890, which is 9,6,3,0,6,8,9,0. So, two 0s, two 6s, two 9s. So, any of those could be a good starting point.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 of the highest digit I have, which is 9. So, 2 9s. That might be a better move because higher digits are harder to challenge, perhaps.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think: if I bid 2 9s, the opponent might have none, making the total exactly 2, so I win. If they have one, total is 3, I still win. If they have two, total is 4, which is higher than my bid, so I still win. So, 2 9s is also a safe bid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid 3 9s, hoping the opponent has at least one. But that's risky because if they have none, the total is 2, which is less than 3, and I lose.\n\nSo, better to stick with 2 9s. That way, regardless of what the opponent has, I'm safe.\n\nWait, but if I bid 2 9s, and the opponent has, say, three 9s, then the total is 5, which is higher than my bid, so I still win. So, 2 9s is a solid bid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 6s. Same logic applies.\n\nI think I'll go with 2 9s because 9 is a higher digit, and it's less likely that the opponent would have a higher digit to bid next. So, let's make the bid 2 9s.\n\nWait, but in the initial state, the bid is None, so I can choose any digit and quantity. So, 2 9s is a good start. It's a moderate bid, not too high, but shows strength.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 9s, but that's risky as I only have two. So, better to bid 2.\n\nSo, the action is BID: 2 9s.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user had two 6s and bid 4 6s. Wait, no, in example 1, the user had two 6s and bid 4 6s, which seems higher than their actual count. So, perhaps they were trying to bluff or expecting the opponent to have more.\n\nBut in my case, I don't want to overbid. So, 2 9s is safer.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 0s, which might be a safer bet because 0s are more common, perhaps.\n\nBut I think 2 9s is a solid choice. So, I'll go with that.\n"
