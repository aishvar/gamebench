You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I'm Player 0, starting the bidding in a game of Liar's Poker. My hand is 28015701. I need to look at the digits I have and decide on the initial bid. \n\nFirst, let me count how many of each digit I have. My hand is 2,8,0,1,5,7,0,1. So:\n\n- 0 appears 2 times (positions 3 and 7)\n- 1 appears 2 times (positions 4 and 8)\n- 2 appears once\n- 5 once\n- 7 once\n- 8 once\n\nSo the most common digits in my hand are 0 and 1, each with two instances. Since the current bid is None, I need to make the first bid. The goal is to start with a bid that's plausible but also gives me room to maneuver. \n\nSince there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total digits in play are 16. The maximum possible for any digit is 16, but that's highly unlikely. Since I have two 0s, maybe the opponent has some as well. If I bid on 0s, considering I have two, maybe the opponent has one or two. So a total of 3 or 4. But since it's the first bid, I don't want to go too high. \n\nAlternatively, 1s are also two in my hand. Maybe starting with a bid of 3 0s or 3 1s. But which digit is higher? 3 1s vs 3 0s. Since digits go from 0-9, higher digits are better. So if I bid on a higher digit, even with the same quantity, it's a better bid. For example, 3 1s is higher than 3 0s. \n\nWait, but the first bid can be any quantity and digit. Since there's no previous bid, I just need to set the initial bid. The challenge is to choose a bid that's not too aggressive but also not too low. \n\nLooking at my hand, maybe 3 1s. Because I have two 1s, and the opponent might have one or two. So total possible 3 or 4. If I bid 3 1s, that's plausible. Alternatively, 2 8s, but I have one 8. The opponent might have none, making the total 1, which would be a bad bid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, 2 8s. But if I have one, and the opponent has none, that's a total of 1, which is less than 2. But since I'm starting, maybe it's better to go with a digit I have more of. \n\nAlternatively, 4 0s. Since I have two, the opponent would need to have two for a total of four. But that's possible. Wait, no: 2 (mine) + opponent's. If I have two, opponent could have up to six (since they have 8 digits). But 2 + 6 = 8. So 4 is possible. But if I bid 4 0s, that's a higher quantity. \n\nBut since it's the first bid, maybe starting lower. The lowest possible bid would be 1 0s, but that's too low. Since any bid is allowed as the first move, but the next player has to beat it. So perhaps start with a moderate bid that's based on my hand. \n\nSince I have two 1s and two 0s, maybe bid 3 1s. That way, even if the opponent has one, total is three. If they have two, total is four. So 3 is safe. Alternatively, 2 1s would be even safer, but the next player can easily bid higher. Since the initial bid has to be higher than \"None\", which is considered as zero, any bid is allowed. Wait, no: the rules say that the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid. But the initial bid is None, so any first bid is allowed. So the first player can bid any quantity and digit. \n\nSo the best strategy is to start with a bid that's based on my own hand and has a reasonable chance of being true. Since I have two 1s, bidding 3 1s would require the opponent to have at least one. Given that there are 8 digits left in opponent's hand, the probability that they have at least one 1 is decent. Alternatively, 2 1s would be certain (since I have two, total is at least two). But the opponent can challenge if I bid 2 1s, but since that's exactly what I have, they might challenge and lose. Wait, because if I bid 2 1s, and my hand has two, the opponent could have zero, making the total two. So the bid is exactly met. So the challenger would lose. Therefore, bidding 2 1s is safe. But perhaps it's better to start higher to pressure the opponent. \n\nAlternatively, since I have two 0s and two 1s, maybe bid 4 0s. But that's a higher quantity. If the opponent has two 0s, total is four, which matches. If they have one, total three, which is less. So that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, bid 3 0s. Since I have two, opponent needs at least one. Possible. \n\nAlternatively, bid 2 8s. I have one 8. Opponent might have none. So total is one, which is less than two. That's a bad bid. \n\nSo perhaps the safest initial bid is 2 1s. Because I have two, so the total is at least two. If I bid 2 1s, then the opponent can't challenge because the total is exactly two (if they have none) or more. Wait, no: if I bid 2 1s, and the total is two (my two), then the bid is valid. If the opponent challenges, they lose. So bidding 2 1s is a guaranteed win if challenged. But then the opponent would have to either bid higher (like 3 of a higher digit) or challenge. But if they challenge, they lose. Therefore, bidding 2 1s is a safe initial move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, 2 8s. But as I have one, opponent might have none, making total one, which is less than two. So that's a bad bid. So better to stick with digits I have more of. \n\nAlternatively, bid 3 0s. Since I have two, opponent needs at least one. The chance that opponent has at least one 0 is higher. Since there are 8 digits in their hand, and the digits are 0-9, the probability that they have at least one 0 might be decent. Let me calculate. Total remaining digits: 8. The total pool for all digits is 16 (each player has 8). But in reality, each player's digits are secret. So opponent's digits are unknown. \n\nThe probability that the opponent has at least one 0: there are 8 digits in their hand. The total number of 0s in the entire game could be up to 16 (if all are 0s). But in reality, my hand has two 0s. So the remaining 14 digits (since total is 16, 16-2=14) include the opponent's 8 digits. So there are 14 digits left, of which some could be 0s. The opponent has 8 of those 14. The number of 0s in the remaining 14 is unknown. But assuming uniform distribution (which may not be the case), but without knowing, it's hard. \n\nBut since I have two 0s, the opponent could have anywhere from 0 to 14 0s (but realistically, since there are 14 digits left, the maximum possible 0s the opponent can have is 14, but that's impossible because they have 8 digits. Wait, no: the total remaining digits (14) include all digits except my 8. So opponent's 8 digits are part of those 14. So the maximum number of 0s the opponent could have is 14 if all 14 are 0s, but that's impossible because the opponent has only 8. So the maximum they could have is 8. So total 0s in the game would be my 2 + opponent's 8 =10. But that's highly unlikely. \n\nBut in reality, the actual number depends on the initial shuffle. But since I don't have that information, I have to base it on probability. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to bid on a digit that's higher in value even if the quantity is the same. For example, if I bid 2 1s, the opponent can bid 2 2s, which is higher. But if I bid 2 8s, which is a higher digit, but risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 8s. But as I have one, opponent needs at least one. That's possible but not certain. \n\nHmm. Let's think again. The safest initial bid is one that is at least the number I have, but not too high. Since I have two 1s and two 0s, bidding 2 1s is safe because the total is at least two. If the opponent has none, the total is two, which meets the bid. If they have one or more, the total is higher. Therefore, bidding 2 1s is a safe initial bid because it's guaranteed to be at least two. Therefore, if the opponent challenges, they lose. \n\nBut perhaps the opponent knows that and will not challenge, but instead make a higher bid. So maybe starting with a higher bid. For example, 3 1s. Since I have two, the opponent needs to have at least one. If they have one, total is three. If they have none, total is two, which is less than three, so if they challenge, I lose. So that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, bid 2 1s: guaranteed to be safe. Then the opponent has to either bid higher, which they can do by increasing the quantity or the digit. For example, they can bid 3 1s, or 2 2s, etc. But if I start with 2 1s, the opponent might challenge immediately if they have no 1s. Wait, but if I have two 1s, and the opponent has none, the total is two. So my bid of 2 1s is exactly met. Therefore, if challenged, I win. So bidding 2 1s is actually a safe bid. Because the total will be at least two. \n\nWait, no: the bid is that the total count is at least the quantity. So if I bid 2 1s, and the total is two (my two), then the bid is valid. So the challenger would lose. Therefore, bidding 2 1s is a safe move. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 3 1s, then the total would need to be three. If the opponent has one, total is three. If they have none, total is two, which is less. So that's a 50/50. \n\nTherefore, the safest initial bid is 2 1s. But maybe the opponent will challenge anyway, thinking that I'm bluffing. But since I actually have two, they would lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, 2 8s. If I have one, opponent needs one. But if they have none, total is one, which is less than two. Then if they challenge, I lose. So that's risky. \n\nSo the best initial bid is 2 1s because it's guaranteed to be at least two. Therefore, I should bid 2 1s.\n"
