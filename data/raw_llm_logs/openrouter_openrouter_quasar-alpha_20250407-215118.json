Since I have two, Player 0 needs to have at least one 5 for their bid to be valid. This is plausible. To avoid risking a challenge on a reasonable bid, I should either raise or challenge if I think 3 5s is unlikely. Given that 3 is quite reasonable, challenging now is risky. The next higher bid must be at least 3 6s (digit increase) or 4 of any digit. I have two 3s in my hand, so bidding 4 3s would be aggressive but plausible, but not safer. I have two 3s, one 8, two 5s, two 3s, two 7s, one 1, one 4. The safest next bid is 3 6s, but I previously bid that, and Player 0 shifted digits back to 5s, likely because they have more 5s. Alternatively, I can bid 4 3s or 4 5s. Since I have two 5s, and the opponent likely has at least one or two, bidding 4 5s is plausible and the safest escalation.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 5s\"\n}",
