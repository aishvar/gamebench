For Player 1's hand, the expected average count of '2's is roughly 0 to 2, but 3 total '2's is plausible. Since I hold one '2', Player 1 would need at least two '2's to make the bid valid, which is possible but not guaranteed. However, the bid is not overly aggressive yet, so challenging now might be premature. To maintain pressure and gather more information, I will make a conservative higher bid by increasing the digit while keeping the quantity the same, choosing 3 5s (since I have two 5s), which is a safe incremental bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 5s\"\n}",
