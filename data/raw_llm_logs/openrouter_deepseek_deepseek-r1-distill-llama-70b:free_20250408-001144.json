        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 1s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the current state. My hand is 24563148, which means I have the digits 2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 1, 4, 8. Let me count how many of each digit I have. I have two 4s, and one each of 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8. So, I have two 4s, which is good to note.\n\nThe current bid is 3 1s, made by Player 0. The bid history shows that Player 0 started with 2 1s, I bid 2 4s, and then Player 0 upped it to 3 1s. Now it's my turn again. I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid.\n\nFirst, I should assess the likelihood of the current bid being true. Player 0 is claiming there are at least three 1s in total between both players. I have one 1 in my hand, so Player 0 must have at least two 1s for the total to be three. But I don't know Player 0's hand, so I can't be certain.\n\nLooking at the possible digits I can bid on. Since I have two 4s, maybe I can bid on 4s. The last bid was 3 1s, so I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Bidding on 4s with a higher quantity than 3 would be 4 4s. But I only have two in my hand, so I'm not sure if the total can reach four. Alternatively, I could bid a higher digit with the same quantity, like 3 5s, since 5 is higher than 1.\n\nBut wait, if I bid 3 5s, and the total number of 5s is actually less than three, I might lose. I only have one 5, so Player 0 would need to have two 5s for that to be true. That seems a bit risky. On the other hand, if I bid 4 4s, I have two, so Player 0 would need to have two as well. But that might be too optimistic.\n\nAnother option is to challenge the current bid. If I challenge 3 1s, and the total is less than three, I win. Since I have one 1, Player 0 would need at least two. If they have two, the total is three, so the bid is valid. If they have only one or none, I win. But I don't know their hand, so it's a gamble.\n\nConsidering the possible digits, maybe I should look for a digit where I have a higher count or a higher digit. Since I have two 4s, maybe I can bid 3 4s, which is higher than 3 1s because 4 is higher than 1. That way, I'm using the same quantity but a higher digit, which is a valid bid. The total number of 4s would need to be at least three. I have two, so Player 0 would need at least one. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 4 of a higher digit. For example, 4 5s would require four 5s in total. I have one, so Player 0 would need three, which is possible but less likely. Similarly, 4 6s would require three from the opponent, which is also possible but uncertain.\n\nGiven the options, bidding 3 4s seems safer because I have two, and it's likely Player 0 has at least one. It's a balanced move that doesn't overcommit. Plus, it's a higher bid than 3 1s, so it fits the game's rules.\n\nSo, I think I'll make the bid of 3 4s. It's a reasonable move based on my hand and the current bid.\n"
