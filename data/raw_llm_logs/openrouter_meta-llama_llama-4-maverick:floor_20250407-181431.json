The total number of zeros across both hands must be at least 2 (my zeros) and at most 10 (if Player 0 had all 8 zeros, which is unlikely). Since the bid is 3 0s, it's possible but I need to consider the probability. Given that I have 2 zeros, it's plausible that together we have at least 3 zeros if Player 0 has at least 1 zero. However, I can bid higher to try to get more information or put pressure on Player 0. I can bid '3 1s' as a valid higher bid is not possible with the quantity, so I'll bid on a different digit.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 1s\"\n}\n```",
