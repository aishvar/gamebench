You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of 2 8s. First, I should look at my own hand. My digits are 66315575. Let me count the digits here. \n\nLooking at my hand: 6 appears twice, 5 appears three times (positions 3,5,6?), wait let me list them out properly. The hand is 6,6,3,1,5,5,7,5. So the digits are 6,6,3,1,5,5,7,5. That's two 6s, three 5s, one 3, one 1, one 7. So for 8s, I have zero in my hand. \n\nThe current bid is 2 8s. Since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total digits are 16. The opponent's bid claims there are at least two 8s in total. Since I have none, the opponent might have two or more 8s. But maybe not. \n\nIf I want to bid higher, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity but a higher digit. The next possible bids could be 3 of any digit, or 2 9s (since 9 is higher than 8). Alternatively, since my hand has three 5s, maybe I can bid on 5s. Let's see.\n\nThe current bid is 2 8s. To bid higher, I could go to 3 of any digit (since 3 >2), or 2 9s (since 9 is higher than 8). Alternatively, even 2 9s would be a valid higher bid. \n\nAlternatively, if I think the current bid is too high, I can challenge. Let's think: the total possible 8s. Since I have none, the opponent could have up to 8 8s, but that's unlikely. The bid is 2 8s, so even if the opponent has two, then it's valid. But maybe they don't. \n\nWait, the current bid is 2 8s. To challenge, I need to think if the total number of 8s is less than 2. Since I have 0, the opponent must have at least 2. If I challenge, I'm betting they have less than 2. But since I don't know their hand, maybe they have two 8s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can make a better bid. Let's see what digits I have. My hand has three 5s. If I bid 3 5s, that would be a valid higher bid (since 3>2, regardless of the digit). That's a good option. \n\nWait, the bid has to be higher in quantity or same quantity but higher digit. So 3 5s is higher than 2 8s because the quantity is higher. So that's a valid move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid 2 9s, which is same quantity but higher digit. Since 9 >8, that's also a valid bid. \n\nWhich is better? Let's see. Let's think about my own hand. If I bid 3 5s, then I have three 5s, so that's a strong position. But the opponent might have some 5s too, so the total could be higher. But maybe I can safely bid that. \n\nAlternatively, bidding 2 9s: since I have zero 9s, that's risky unless I think the opponent has at least two 9s. But since I don't have any, maybe it's a bluff. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent's bid of 2 8s is reasonable. Since they could have two 8s, but maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 3 5s, that's a safer bid since I have three, so even if the opponent has none, the total is 3, so the bid is valid. That seems safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is to bid 3 5s. Because that's a higher quantity (3 vs 2), so it's a valid bid. Plus, since I have three of them, that gives me confidence. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid even higher. What's the maximum possible? The total digits are 16. But the current bid is 2, so I could go to 3, 4, etc. But bidding 3 5s is a safe step. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bidding 3 6s? I have two 6s. If I bid 3 6s, that's a higher quantity than 2, but I only have two. That might be a bluff. \n\nAlternatively, sticking with 5s since I have three. \n\nSo the best play is to bid 3 5s. That's a valid higher bid and I have three, so even if the opponent has none, the bid holds. \n\nTherefore, the action should be BID: 3 5s. \n\nThe reasoning would be that since I have three 5s, bidding 3 5s is a higher bid than 2 8s, and I have a strong basis for it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better bid. Let me check again. \n\nAnother option: BID: 2 9s. Since 9 is higher than 8. But I have zero 9s, so that's a bluff. The opponent might have some, but it's risky. \n\nAlternatively, BID: 3 of a lower digit. But the digit doesn't matter if the quantity is higher. \n\nSo 3 5s is better. \n\nTherefore, the action should be BID:3 5s. \n\nWait, but let me check the rules again. The bid has to be strictly higher. 3 5s is higher quantity than 2 8s, so yes. \n\nSo the reasoning is that I have three 5s, so I can safely increase the quantity to 3, making the bid valid. Hence, the action is BID:3 5s.\n"
