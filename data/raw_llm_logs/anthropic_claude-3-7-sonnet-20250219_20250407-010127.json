        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

The current bid is \\'3 5s\\', meaning Player 0 is claiming there are at least 3 fives in total between our hands. Looking at my own hand (12731984), I have only one 5 (none in my hand). This means Player 0 would need to have at least 2 fives in their hand for their bid to be valid. While this is certainly possible, it\\'s not guaranteed. I have 8 digits in my hand, and Player 0 also has 8 digits, for a total of 16 digits. The probability of Player 0 having at least 2 fives is reasonable. Given that this is the first bid and relatively conservative, I\\'ll make a higher bid. I can either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity but increase the digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 1s, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 7, one 8, and one 9. Since I have two 1s, I could bid \\'3 6s\\' (keeping the quantity but increasing the digit) or \\'4 1s\\' (increasing the quantity and using a digit I know I have multiple of). I\\'ll go with \\'3 6s\\' as it\\'s a safer bid that only requires Player 0 to have at least 2 sixes, which is similar in probability to them having 2 fives.\", \"action\": \"BID: 3 6s\"}', type='text')"
