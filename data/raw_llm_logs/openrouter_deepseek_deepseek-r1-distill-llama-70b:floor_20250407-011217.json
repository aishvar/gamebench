You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn to make a bid. The current bid is None, which means I get to start the bidding. My hand is 61446271. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the rules. Each player has 8 secret digits, so there are 16 digits in total across both hands. Bids are about the total count of a specific digit. I can bid a quantity and a digit, like \"3 5s,\" which means there are at least three 5s in total. My bid has to be strictly higher than the previous one, either by quantity or digit value.\n\nSince the current bid is None, I can start by bidding anything. I should look at my hand to see which digits I have and how many of each. Let me list out my digits: 6, 1, 4, 4, 6, 2, 7, 1. So, I have two 6s, two 1s, two 4s, and one each of 2 and 7.\n\nI think the best approach is to bid on the digit I have the most of. In my hand, 6, 1, and 4 each appear twice. So, I can choose any of these. But I also need to consider what the opponent might have. Since I don't know their digits, I should make a bid that's reasonable but not too high, to avoid being challenged.\n\nIf I bid on 6s, since I have two, the total could be up to whatever the opponent has. But if I bid 2 6s, that's a safe start. Alternatively, I could go higher if I think the opponent might have more. However, since it's the first bid, starting low might be better to see how the opponent reacts.\n\nWait, but the example given in the problem had a bid of 4 6s when the player had two 6s. So maybe I can do something similar. But in this case, I have two 6s, so bidding 2 6s seems accurate. But since the bid can be higher, maybe I can bid 3 6s, assuming the opponent might have at least one. That way, the total would be at least three.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 4s or 1s. Let me check: I have two 1s. If I bid 2 1s, that's safe. But 1 is a low digit, so maybe it's better to choose a higher digit to have more flexibility in future bids.\n\nSo, between 6, 4, and 1, 6 is the highest. Bidding 2 6s is a good start. But wait, can I bid higher than that? Since I have two, the opponent could have zero, one, or two. If I bid 3 6s, and the opponent has one, then the total is three, which would make my bid valid. If they have none, then I lose if challenged.\n\nHmm, but since it's the first bid, maybe it's safer to start with a lower quantity. If I bid 2 6s, that's definitely true because I have two. The opponent can't challenge that because even if they have zero, the total is two, which meets the bid. So, maybe I should bid 2 6s.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 6s, hoping the opponent has at least one. But that's risky because if they have none, I lose. So, perhaps it's better to play it safe.\n\nWait, another thought: the maximum any digit can have is 16, but that's across both players. So, for 6s, the max I can have is 8, but that's unlikely. So, bidding 2 6s is safe, and I can always increase later.\n\nSo, I think I'll bid 2 6s. That way, I'm making a valid bid based on my hand, and it's a starting point for the game.\n"
