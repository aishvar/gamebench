        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and I need to decide what to do next. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at my hand: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 0, 6, 2. So, I have eight digits here. Let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\nLooking through them: 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8. Each of these digits appears once except for 8, which I have one of. So, in my hand, I have one 8. \n\nThe current bid is 2 8s, made by Player 1. The bid history shows that I started with 1 8s, and Player 1 upped it to 2 8s. Now it's my turn again. I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid.\n\nIf I challenge, and the total number of 8s is less than 2, I win. But if it's 2 or more, Player 1 wins. Since I have one 8, the other player must have at least one more for the bid to be valid. But wait, the total number of 8s could be exactly 2, which would make the bid correct. \n\nAlternatively, I could try to make a higher bid. To do that, I need to bid either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since the current bid is 2 8s, the next possible bids could be 3 of any digit, or 2 of a higher digit than 8, but since 8 is the highest digit, I can't go higher there. So, I would have to bid at least 3 of some digit.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have one of each digit except for 8. So, I don't have three of any digit. Therefore, I can't safely bid 3 of any digit because I don't have enough in my own hand to support that. \n\nSo, my options are limited. I can either challenge the 2 8s or try to bid something higher. But since I can't bid higher without possibly lying, which is risky, maybe challenging is the better option.\n\nBut wait, if I challenge and the total is exactly 2, I lose. If it's more than 2, I also lose. If it's less than 2, I win. Since I have one 8, the other player must have at least one to make the total 2. But maybe they have more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have zero, making the total 1, which would mean I win if I challenge. But I don't know their hand. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. I have to weigh the probabilities. Since I have one 8, the other player could have one or more. If they have one, the total is 2, which makes their bid correct. If they have two or more, the bid is still correct. If they have zero, I win. \n\nBut since the initial bid was 1 8s, and they upped it to 2, they might be confident they have at least two. But I only have one, so unless they have two, the total would be three, which would make their bid of 2 correct. Wait, no, if I have one and they have two, the total is three, which is more than 2, so their bid is still correct. \n\nWait, no, the bid is for at least the quantity. So, if the total is 3, the bid of 2 is still valid because 3 >= 2. So, challenging when the total is 3 would make me lose. \n\nSo, the only way I win by challenging is if the total is exactly 1. That means the other player has zero 8s. But is that likely? \n\nI don't know their hand, but I have one 8. If I think they might not have any, then challenging could be good. But if they have one or more, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to bid higher. But as I thought earlier, I can't bid 3 of any digit because I don't have three. So, maybe I can bid 2 of a higher digit. But 8 is the highest, so I can't go higher. \n\nWait, no, the digits go from 0 to 9, so 9 is higher than 8. So, I could bid 2 9s. But do I have any 9s? Looking back at my hand: 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8. No 9s. So, I can't bid 2 9s because I don't have any. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 of a lower digit that I have more of, but since I only have one of each, that's not possible. So, I can't make a valid higher bid without lying, which is risky. \n\nTherefore, my only safe move is to challenge the bid. I think the chance that the other player has zero 8s is low, but maybe they have one, making the total 2, which would make their bid correct. But I have to decide based on the information I have. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the previous bids. I bid 1 8s, and they upped it to 2. Maybe they are trying to bluff, thinking I don't have any. But I do have one, so if they have one, the total is 2, which is exactly their bid. \n\nI'm not sure. It's a 50-50 chance, but I don't have enough information. Given that, maybe challenging is better because if I'm wrong, I lose, but if I'm right, I win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid 3 of a digit I have. Wait, I have one of each digit, so I can't. \n\nSo, I think challenging is the best option here.\n"
