To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have two 2s, bidding a higher quantity than 2 is not possible for me with this digit. I can bid on a higher digit if I have it. Looking at my hand, I have one 5, one 7, one 8, one 9, one 4, and one other digits (0, 1, 3, 6 are missing). I have one 5, one 7, one 8, one 9, and other digits. I see I have one 5. If I bid on 1 5, it would be a lower digit bid but with quantity 1 which does not beat '2 2s'. However, I can try to challenge if I think the bid of '2 2s' is unlikely to be beaten or higher. But first, let's see if bidding is an option.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 1 5\"\n}\n```",
