        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 1s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, let's break down the situation. I'm Player 1 in a game of Liar's Poker. My hand is 19320403, which gives me the digits: 1, 9, 3, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3. So, I have two 0s, one 1, two 3s, a 2, a 4, and a 9.\n\nThe current bid is 2 1s made by Player 0. The bidding history shows that Player 0 started with 1 0s, then I bid 2 0s, and now Player 0 is at 2 1s. \n\nI need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. The rules state that a bid must be strictly higher than the current bid. Higher can be either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 0s. Since the last bid was 2 1s, I can consider bidding on a digit higher than 1 or increase the quantity. However, the quantity is already 2, and the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. \n\nIf I bid on 2 2s, that would be higher than 2 1s because the digit is higher. But I don't have any 2s in my hand except one, so I'm not sure if that's a good move. Alternatively, I could bid on 3 0s, but I only have two 0s, making it risky.\n\nConsidering the opponent is a naive player, they might not have a strong hand. The current bid of 2 1s is just a small number. Since the maximum possible for 1s is 16, but with only 8 digits each, the total can't exceed 16. \n\nI think challenging might be a good move here. If I challenge, and the total number of 1s is less than 2, I win. If not, the opponent wins. Given that I only have one 1, it's possible that the opponent doesn't have any, making the total count 1, which is less than the bid of 2. \n\nSo, challenging seems like a strategic choice to potentially win the round without making a risky bid.\n"
