        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let me try to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker situation. So, I'm Player 0, and I have the hand 13167047. The current bid is 4 6s from Player 1. I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid.\n\nFirst, I'll look at my own hand. It's 1, 3, 1, 6, 7, 0, 4, 7. So, I have one 6 and two 7s. That means in my hand, there's only one 6. Since the current bid is 4 6s, I wonder how many 6s Player 1 might have.\n\nLet me think about the total number of 6s possible. There are two players, each with 8 digits, so 16 digits in total. If the bid is 4 6s, that means there need to be at least four 6s between both players. I have one 6, so Player 1 must have at least three 6s to make the total four. But does Player 1 have three 6s? That seems possible, but I don't know for sure.\n\nLooking at the bid history might help. The first bid was 2 7s by me, then Player 1 bid 3 5s, I went to 3 6s, and now Player 1 upped it to 4 6s. So, the bidding has been increasing in both quantity and digit. I need to decide if 4 6s is a reasonable bid or if it's a bluff.\n\nIf I challenge, and it turns out there are at least four 6s, I lose. If there are fewer than four, I win. Since I have one 6, Player 1 needs at least three. But is that likely? I don't have any information about Player 1's hand, so it's hard to tell. Maybe Player 1 is trying to bluff, or maybe they actually have the 6s.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to make a higher bid. The current bid is 4 6s, so I could either increase the quantity or the digit. If I increase the quantity, I could bid 5 6s, but I only have one 6, so I would need Player 1 to have four 6s. That might be risky. Alternatively, I could bid the same quantity but a higher digit, like 4 7s. I have two 7s, so if I bid 4 7s, that would require at least two more 7s from Player 1. But I don't know if Player 1 has any 7s.\n\nWait, but the current bid is 4 6s. If I bid 4 7s, that's a higher digit, so it's a valid bid. But is it a good idea? If I have two 7s, and I bid 4 7s, Player 1 might challenge, thinking I'm bluffing. Or they might have two 7s themselves, making the total four. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 5 6s, but that's a higher quantity. I'm not sure if that's safe. Since I only have one 6, I'd need Player 1 to have four, which might be a stretch.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I should challenge the 4 6s bid. If I challenge and there are only three 6s or fewer, I win. But if there are four or more, I lose. Given that I have one, it's possible Player 1 has three, making it four total. But maybe they have more. It's a bit of a gamble.\n\nI'm leaning towards challenging because I don't have enough information to make a higher bid confidently. If I challenge and lose, I might be giving Player 1 the win, but if I'm right, I win. Alternatively, if I make a higher bid and it's challenged, I could lose if I don't have the digits.\n\nWait, but if I make a bid, I can choose a digit I have more of. I have two 7s, so maybe I can bid 4 7s. That way, if Player 1 doesn't have two 7s, I might be safe. But again, it's risky.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure. Maybe challenging is safer because I don't have to commit to a higher bid that might not hold. If I challenge, the worst that happens is I lose if there are four or more 6s, but I might gain if there aren't.\n\nI think I'll go with challenging the bid because I don't have enough 6s to feel confident in a higher bid, and I don't want to risk making a bid that could be challenged successfully.\n"
