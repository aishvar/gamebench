        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me go through the information step by step.\n\nFirst, my hand is 71674492. Let me write that out: 7, 1, 6, 7, 4, 4, 9, 2. So, I have two 7s, one 6, two 4s, one 1, one 9, and one 2. That's my set of digits.\n\nThe current bid is 4 6s, made by Player 0. The bid history shows that the bids have been escalating: starting from 2 6s, then 2 7s, 3 6s, 3 7s, and now 4 6s. It seems like both players are trying to outbid each other on 6s and 7s.\n\nI need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. To challenge, I have to think if 4 6s is plausible. Let's see. There are two players, each with 8 digits, so 16 digits in total. The current bid is 4 6s.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have one 6. So, if I have one, the opponent could have up to three 6s to make the total four. But I don't know their hand. Alternatively, maybe the opponent is bluffing.\n\nIf I challenge and the total is less than 4, I win. If it's 4 or more, I lose. So, I need to assess the likelihood that there are at least four 6s in total.\n\nGiven that the bids have been going up on 6s, Player 0 might have a couple of 6s. Let's say they have two 6s. Then, with my one, that's three. They might be hoping I have at least one, making it four. But if I only have one, and they have two, that's three total, which is less than the bid. So, challenging might be a good move here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 4 6s, I can either bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. I have two 7s, so maybe I can bid 4 7s. That would be a valid bid because 7 is higher than 6. Let me see.\n\nIf I bid 4 7s, I'm claiming there are at least four 7s in total. I have two, so the opponent would need at least two more. But considering the previous bids, Player 0 might have some 7s as well. Wait, looking back, I bid 2 7s and then 3 7s, so maybe I was trying to push that. But Player 0 kept going back to 6s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid 5 6s, but that's a higher quantity. But I only have one 6, so I'm not sure if that's wise. It might be risky because if the total is less than five, I lose.\n\nSo, weighing the options: challenging the 4 6s bid might be safer because if there are only three 6s in total, I win. If there are four or more, I lose. Given that I have only one 6, and the opponent might have two or three, it's a bit uncertain.\n\nBut considering the bid history, Player 0 has been pushing 6s, which might indicate they have a few. So, maybe the total is four or more, making the challenge risky. Alternatively, if they're bluffing, the total could be lower.\n\nI think challenging is a good move here because the risk of the bid being true isn't too high, given that I only have one 6. If the opponent has three, that's four total, but that's a lot. They might have two, making it three total, which would make the bid false.\n\nSo, I'll choose to challenge the current bid.\n"
