Since I have none, both 6s would need to be in Player 1's hand. This is possible but somewhat unlikely, as having exactly two 6s among eight digits is not guaranteed. However, it's plausible enough that challenging now might be premature. A safe and strategic approach is to raise the bid modestly. The lowest valid raise is to increase the digit (because the quantity is the same). The next digit after 6 is 7, so I can bid 2 7s, which is a minimal legal raise and puts pressure back on Player 1 without overcommitting.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 7\"\n}",
