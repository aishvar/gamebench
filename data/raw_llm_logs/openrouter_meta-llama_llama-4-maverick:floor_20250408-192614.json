        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

The bid of 2 9s implies that the other player has at least two 9s. Given that the total count of 9s across both hands is at least 2, I can make a higher bid by either increasing the quantity or the digit. I can bid 3 0s or higher, or 2 [digit]s where [digit] is greater than 9 (not possible since 9 is the highest digit). My hand contains one 2, one 4, one 5, one 3, one 7, and two 1s, and no 9s or 8s. Bidding 2 8s or 2 7s isn't a good idea because it doesn't increase the quantity, and I don't have enough information about the other player's hand. However, I can bid 3 0s or 3 1s as both are valid higher bids. I see that I have two 1s and one 2 and other lower digits, so bidding 3 1s seems plausible as it increases the quantity.\", \"action\": \"BID: 3 1s\"}",
