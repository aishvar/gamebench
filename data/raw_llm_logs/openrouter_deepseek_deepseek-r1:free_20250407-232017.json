You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm Player 0 in this Liar's Poker game, and it's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 1,7,5,0,9,5,3,9. Let me see what digits I have here. Let's count them: 1 occurs once, 7 once, 5 twice, 0 once, 9 twice, 3 once. So in my hand, the most frequent digits are 5 and 9, each appearing twice. \n\nSince there's no current bid (it's the first move), I can start with any valid bid. The challenge is to choose a bid that's a good starting point but not too risky. I need to consider that the opponent has 8 digits as well. The total possible maximum for any digit is 16 (since both players have 8 each), but starting high might be risky.\n\nLooking at my hand, the digits 5 and 9 are the most common. Each has two in my hand. If I bid on one of these, say 2 5s, that's a safe starting point because I have two myself. But since the opponent could have more, but also could have none. However, the first bid needs to be a base. Alternatively, maybe start a bit higher to put pressure. But since it's the first bid, maybe a conservative approach is better. \n\nWait, the rules say that each bid must be strictly higher than the current bid. Since the current bid is None, the first bid can be anything. Wait, no, the rules state: \"Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" Wait, but 'None' isn't a bid. So maybe the requirement is that the first bid can be any valid bid because there's nothing to compare. Wait, the initial instruction says \"Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" But how can a bid be higher than 'None'? That might mean that the first bid can be any valid bid, since there's nothing to compare. So maybe the first player can start with any quantity and digit. For example, bidding 1 0s would be acceptable. But since I want to set a reasonable bid that's not too easy to challenge, I should pick something that's likely true based on my hand but leaves room for the opponent to bid higher.\n\nIn my hand, I have two 5s and two 9s. Let's think about the total possible. If I bid 3 5s, that means I'm claiming there are at least three 5s in total. Since I have two, the opponent needs to have at least one. That's possible but not certain. Alternatively, if I bid 2 5s, that's a safe bid because I have two, so even if the opponent has none, the total is two. But wait, the total across all players is both hands. So if I bid 2 5s, that's exactly what I have, but the opponent could have more. Wait, but the bid is \"at least\" that quantity. So if I bid 2 5s, and the opponent has, say, one, then the total is three, which is more than two. So that's safe. But since I have two, the minimum total is two (if opponent has none), and maximum is 8 (if opponent has six 5s, but that's unlikely). So a bid of 2 5s is actually safe because even if the opponent has zero, the total is two, which meets the bid. Wait no: the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So if I bid 2 5s, and the total is two (my two), then the bid is valid. So that's a safe bid. But starting with 2 5s might be too low, allowing the opponent to easily raise. Alternatively, maybe start with a higher bid based on my hand.\n\nAlternatively, since I have two 5s and two 9s, maybe I can bid 4 of a higher digit, like 9s. Wait, but 4 9s would require that there are at least four 9s in total. I have two, so the opponent needs to have at least two. That's possible but not guaranteed. That's a bit risky. Maybe too aggressive for an opening bid.\n\nAlternatively, since I have a 0 in my hand, maybe bid 1 0s. That's a very safe bid, but it's very low. The opponent can then easily bid higher, like 2 of any digit. So perhaps better to start with a higher quantity but on a lower digit. For example, 2 5s. That way, even if the opponent has none, the total is two, which meets the bid. But if they have even one, the total is three. So that's a safe opening bid. Alternatively, maybe go for a higher digit. For example, bid 2 9s. Since I have two, the total is at least two, so that's safe. But same logic as 5s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower digit but higher quantity. Wait, but digits range from 0-9, and higher digits have higher value. So a bid of 2 5s can be beaten by 2 6s, etc. So maybe starting with a higher digit would force the opponent to either bid a higher quantity or a higher digit. But since I have two 9s, which are the highest digits in my hand, maybe starting with 2 9s is better. Because if I bid 2 9s, the opponent can either bid a higher quantity (3 of any digit) or a higher digit (like 2 10s, but digits only go up to 9. Wait, digits are 0-9. So the highest digit is 9. So if I bid 2 9s, the opponent can only beat that by bidding a higher quantity (like 3 of any digit) or same quantity but higher digit, but 9 is the highest. So the only way to beat 2 9s is to bid 3 or more of any digit. So that might be a good strategy because the opponent has to either bid higher quantity or challenge.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower bid but on a lower digit so that the opponent can't easily bid a higher digit. For example, if I bid 2 5s, the opponent can bid 2 6s, 7s, etc. So maybe starting with a higher digit is better. Let's compare the options.\n\nIf I bid 2 9s, then the next player can only bid 3 of any digit or challenge. If I bid 2 5s, they can bid 2 6s, 7s, etc., or 3 of anything else. So maybe 2 9s is a stronger opening bid because it forces the opponent to increase the quantity. Since my hand has two 9s, which is a high digit, it's a good starting point. Also, considering that the opponent might have some 9s, but even if they don't, the total is two, which meets the bid. So that's safe. Therefore, the best opening bid would be 2 9s.\n"
