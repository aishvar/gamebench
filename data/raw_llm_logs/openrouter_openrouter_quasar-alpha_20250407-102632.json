        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

The current bid is 3 9s, so for that bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least one 9. Given the naive opponent's random bidding pattern, it's plausible but not guaranteed they have a 9. Since I already hold two 9s, raising to 4 9s would require the opponent to have at least two 9s, which is unlikely. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity with a digit I hold many of. I have two 6s and two 8s as well. Since the current bid is 3 9s, I can outbid with 4 6s or 4 8s. Both are risky, but with two 8s in my hand, a bid of 4 8s relies on the opponent having at least two 8s, which is unlikely. The same applies to 4 6s. Therefore, the current bid of 3 9s is borderline plausible, but a higher bid would be risky. Given these factors, it's best to challenge the current bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
