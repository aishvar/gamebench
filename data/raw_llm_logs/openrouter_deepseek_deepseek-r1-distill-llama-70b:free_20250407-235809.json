You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the current bid is 2 4s from Player 0. My hand is 98326908. I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have the digits: 9, 8, 3, 2, 6, 9, 0, 8. Let me count each digit I have. \n\n- 0: 1\n- 2: 1\n- 3: 1\n- 6: 1\n- 8: 2\n- 9: 2\n\nSo, I have two 8s and two 9s. The current bid is about 4s, which I have none of. Since my hand doesn't have any 4s, I don't have any information that would make me think the total number of 4s is higher than 2. But wait, Player 0 might be trying to trick me. \n\nIf I challenge, and the total number of 4s is exactly 2, then Player 0 wins. But if it's less, I win. But I don't have any 4s, so the only 4s could be in Player 0's hand. Since there are 8 digits each, Player 0 could have up to 8 4s, but that's unlikely. But the bid is only 2, so maybe they have 2 4s. \n\nAlternatively, I could make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 2 4s, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Let's see, I have two 8s and two 9s. If I bid 3 8s, that would require there being at least three 8s in total. Since I have two, Player 0 would need at least one. But I don't know their hand. Or I could bid 2 9s, but that's the same quantity as 2 4s, but a higher digit, so that's a valid higher bid.\n\nWait, the rules say a higher bid can be same quantity but higher digit. So 2 9s is higher than 2 4s because 9 is higher than 4. That might be a safer move because I have two 9s, so the total could be at least two. But if I make that bid, Player 0 could challenge, and if they have no 9s, then the total would be two, which meets the bid. So I might win, but it's a bit risky.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 of a digit I have more of. I only have two of 8s and 9s, so I can't bid 3 of those. What about 2 5s? No, that's lower than 4s. Wait, no, 5 is higher than 4, but the quantity is the same. So 2 5s would actually be a higher bid than 2 4s because 5 > 4. But I don't have any 5s. So maybe that's not a good idea because the total might be zero, and I could lose.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 8s, which is higher than 2 4s. Since I have two 8s, and Player 0 might have some, it's possible. But if I bid that, and the total is two, I win. If it's more, I also win. If it's less, I lose. But since I have two, the minimum is two, so the bid would be safe. So maybe that's a good move.\n\nWait, but the current bid is 2 4s. So I can bid 2 8s, which is higher because 8 > 4. That makes sense. Let me think about that. If I have two 8s, and I bid 2 8s, the total is at least two. So it's a safe bid. Alternatively, I could bid 3 8s, but I only have two, so that's risky unless Player 0 has at least one.\n\nBut I don't know Player 0's hand. So maybe it's safer to bid 2 8s. That way, I'm making a higher bid based on my own hand, and it's likely to be valid. \n\nAlternatively, I could challenge the 2 4s bid. Since I have no 4s, if the total is less than 2, I win. But if Player 0 has exactly two 4s, then I lose. So it's a 50-50, but I don't have any info. \n\nGiven that, I think making a bid is better. So I'll bid 2 8s because I have two and it's a higher digit than 4. That way, I'm increasing the digit, which is a valid higher bid. Plus, it's safer because I know I have two, so the total can't be less than two unless Player 0 has zero, which is possible but less likely if they bid 2 4s.\n\nWait, but if I bid 2 8s, and the total is exactly two, I win. If it's more, I still win. So it's a safe move. Alternatively, if I challenge, and the total is two, I lose. So better to bid 2 8s.\n"
