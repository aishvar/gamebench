For this bid to be true, Player 1 must have at least four 9s in their 8-digit hand, as I have none. The probability of a single player having four or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively low (expected value is 0.8). Given I hold none of the bid digit, the likelihood of the opponent holding at least four is significantly reduced. Bidding higher would require me to bid at least 5 of a digit. My best quantities are two 4s and two 6s. Bidding '5 4s' or '5 6s' would require the opponent to have three of that digit, which is still a significant amount. Given the unlikelihood of the opponent holding four 9s, challenging is the statistically safer and more logical move.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
