I have two 8s and two 7s, which are the most frequent digits in my hand. There are 16 total digits in play (2 players * 8 digits). Statistically, each digit appears 1.6 times on average across all hands. A reasonable opening bid often involves the count of a frequent digit in one's hand, potentially increased by one to account for the opponent's likely holdings. I have two 8s. Bidding '3 8s' is plausible, as it only requires the opponent to have at least one 8 among their 8 digits. Bidding on 8s (a higher digit) is strategically slightly better than bidding on 7s for the same quantity, as it restricts the opponent's next available bids more. Therefore, '3 8s' is a solid opening bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 8\"\n}\n```",
