        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, let's break down this Liar's Poker situation. I'm Player 1, and I have the hand 85890616. The current bid is 4 8s by Player 0. I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge.\n\nFirst, looking at my hand: 8,5,8,9,0,6,1,6. I have two 8s, which is good to note. The current bid is 4 8s, so the total number of 8s in both players' hands needs to be at least 4 for the bid to hold.\n\nI have two 8s, so Player 0 must have at least two 8s as well to make the total four. But wait, is that possible? Each player has 8 digits, so Player 0 could have two 8s, making the total four. But maybe they have more. However, considering the bidding history, Player 0 started with 3 6s, I countered with 3 8s, and then Player 0 upped it to 4 8s. \n\nNow, my hand has two 8s. If I challenge, and the total is less than 4, I win. But if it's 4 or more, Player 0 wins. Given that I have two, Player 0 must have at least two. So the minimum total would be four. Therefore, challenging might not be the best move because there's a high chance the bid is valid.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to bid higher. The current bid is 4 8s. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Increasing the quantity would mean bidding 5 8s, but I only have two, so I don't know if there are three more 8s in Player 0's hand. That's risky. Alternatively, I can bid the same quantity but a higher digit, like 4 9s. Do I have any 9s? Yes, I have one 9. If I bid 4 9s, I need the total to be at least four. I have one, so Player 0 would need three. That's possible, but unsure.\n\nAnother option is to bid a higher digit with the same quantity, but I think 8 is already high. Maybe 4 9s is a safer bid since I have one, and it's a higher digit than 8. But I'm not sure if Player 0 has enough 9s.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 5 of a lower digit. For example, I have two 6s, so maybe 5 6s. But I only have two, so I would need Player 0 to have three 6s. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking back, the bid history was 3 6s, then 3 8s, then 4 8s. Player 0 might be trying to push the bid on 8s. If I have two 8s, and I'm unsure if Player 0 has two or more, maybe it's safer to challenge. But if the total is exactly four, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, I can bid 4 9s. Since I have one, and 9 is higher than 8, it's a valid bid. If the total 9s are four or more, I win. If not, I lose. But I don't know how many 9s Player 0 has.\n\nAnother angle: considering the maximum possible. There are 16 digits in total. If Player 0 has two 8s, that's four in total. If they have three, that's five. But I don't know.\n\nGiven that, I think challenging might be risky because the bid could be exactly four. So perhaps it's better to make a higher bid. Since I have a 9, I can bid 4 9s. That way, if there are four or more 9s, I win. It's a bit of a gamble, but it's a strategic move to test if Player 0 has enough 9s.\n\nSo, I'll decide to bid 4 9s.\n"
