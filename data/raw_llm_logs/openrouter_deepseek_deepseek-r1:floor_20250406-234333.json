                    "reasoning": "Okay, so it's the start of the game, and the current bid is None. That means I can set the first bid. Let me look at my hand: 0, 9, 2, 1, 7, 7, 6, 4. So I have eight digits here. \n\nFirst, I need to count how many of each digit I have. Let's see:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 1\n- 4: 1\n- 6: 1\n- 7: 2\n- 9: 1\n\nSo the most frequent digit in my hand is 7, with two of them. Since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total digits in play are 16. The maximum possible for any digit is 16, but that's highly unlikely.\n\nSince there's no previous bid, I can start with any valid bid. The key is to choose a bid that's not too high but also not too easy to challenge. Since I have two 7s, maybe starting with a bid that reflects that. But if I bid 2 7s, that's a low bid and the opponent might have more 7s. Alternatively, I could start with a higher quantity but a lower digit. Wait, the bid has to be strictly higher than the current bid, but since the current bid is None, any bid is valid. Wait, no, the rules say \"your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" Wait, how does that work? Because if the current bid is None, the first player can bid anything. Because there's no prior bid to compare to. So maybe the initial bid is just any quantity and digit. Wait, the rules say \"your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" Hmm, maybe the 'None' is considered as the lowest possible, so the first bid must be higher than that. But since any bid is higher than nothing, the first player can choose any valid bid. So I can start with any quantity and digit. \n\nBut strategically, what's a good opening bid? Since I have two 7s, maybe bidding 2 7s. But considering that the opponent could have up to 8 digits, which could include more 7s. But if I bid 2 7s, the opponent might challenge if they have none. But if they have, say, one 7, then total is 3, which meets the bid. But maybe starting higher. Alternatively, maybe pick a higher digit. For example, bidding 1 9s. But since I have a 9, but the opponent might have none. So the total could be 1, which would be correct. But that's a low bid, and the opponent can easily raise. \n\nAlternatively, a common strategy is to start with a mid-range digit and a quantity that's a bit higher than what you have, but not too high. Since I have two 7s, maybe bid 3 7s. That way, if the opponent has at least one 7, the total is at least 3, which would be correct. But if they have none, then it's 2, which would be a loss if challenged. But since it's the first bid, the opponent might not challenge immediately. Alternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity but higher digit. For example, bid 2 8s. But I have no 8s. That's risky because if the opponent also has none, then the total is zero. But if I bid 2 8s, and the opponent challenges, I lose. So that's a bad move. \n\nWait, but since I have to make a bid, maybe the safest opening is to bid a digit that I have, and a quantity that's close to how many I have. For example, I have two 7s. So bidding 3 7s. That would require the opponent to have at least one 7. If they have none, then the total is 2, which is less than 3, so if they challenge, I lose. But if they have one, then total is 3, which is correct. Alternatively, maybe bid 2 7s. That's a safer bid, but it's lower. But since the next player has to bid higher, they have to either increase the quantity or the digit. For example, if I bid 2 7s, the opponent can bid 3 of any digit, or 2 8s, 9s, etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower digit but higher quantity. For example, 3 5s. But I don't have any 5s. That's risky. But if the opponent has some 5s, maybe. But since I have none, I don't know. So that's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the total digits are 16, the probability of any digit appearing is higher. For example, digits like 0-9, but each player has 8 digits. So on average, each digit has about 1.6 occurrences across both players. But that's just an average. \n\nWait, but in my hand, I have 0,9,2,1,7,7,6,4. So digits 7 are two. Maybe the opponent has more 7s. But I can't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 4 7s. That would mean that with my two, the opponent needs to have two. But that's possible. But if the opponent has none, then total is two, which is less than four. That's a risky bid. \n\nSo perhaps the best approach is to start with a conservative bid that's based on my own hand but not too aggressive. Since I have two 7s, bidding 2 7s is honest. But the opponent could challenge if they have none. But maybe they have at least one, making the total 3. Alternatively, maybe the opponent has more. But since there's no prior information, maybe starting with 2 7s is safe. However, in the example given, the user's first example starts with 3 5s. Wait, in the example, the user had two 6s and bid 4 6s. So maybe the strategy is to bid higher than your own count to account for the opponent's possible cards. \n\nSo if I have two 7s, maybe bid 3 7s. That way, the opponent needs to have at least one. If they have one, total is 3. If they have more, then it's higher. If they have none, then it's 2, which would lose if challenged. But since it's the first bid, the opponent might not challenge immediately because they might have one or more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, bid 2 8s. But I have no 8s. That's a bluff. If the opponent has, say, two 8s, then total is two, which meets the bid. If they have none, then total is zero, which would lose. But it's a risky move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe pick a digit that's less likely to be in the opponent's hand. For example, 9. I have one 9. So if I bid 2 9s, the opponent needs to have at least one. But if they have none, then total is 1, which is less than 2. But again, it's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe pick a digit that's more common. For example, 0 or 1. I have one 0 and one 1. Bidding 2 0s would require the opponent to have at least one. But same issue. \n\nHmm. So perhaps the best approach is to start with a moderate bid that's based on my own hand but allows room for the opponent to have some. Since I have two 7s, bidding 3 7s seems reasonable. It's a middle-of-the-road bid. The opponent might challenge if they have none, but if they have even one, the bid is valid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe choose a higher digit. For example, bid 2 8s. But again, that's a bluff. \n\nWait, but since the opponent has 8 digits, the chance that they have at least one of any given digit is higher. For example, the probability that the opponent has at least one 7: since I have two, there are 6 7s left in the deck (assuming a standard 40-card deck for Liar's Poker, but wait, the rules here don't specify the deck. Wait, the user's rules just say each player has 8 secret digits. So maybe the digits are generated randomly, not from a standard deck. So the total possible digits are 16 (each player has 8), but each digit is 0-9. So each player's hand is 8 digits, possibly with duplicates. So the total number of each digit in the game could be from 0 to 16. \n\nIn that case, the opponent's hand is 8 digits. So the chance that they have a 7 is higher. For example, each of their 8 digits has a 1/10 chance of being a 7, but with replacement (since duplicates are allowed). So the expected number of 7s in their hand is 8 * (1/10) = 0.8. So on average, the opponent has about 0.8 7s. So total would be 2 + 0.8 \u2248 2.8. So bidding 3 7s would be slightly above average. But there's a chance they have one or more. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 7s, the total would be 2 + their count. If they have one, total is 3. So 2 is a safe bid. But since the bid must be strictly higher than None, which is the current bid, I can start with any bid. \n\nWait, but in the rules, it says \"Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" But how is that possible? Because the current bid is None, so I think that means the first bid can be anything. So I can bid any quantity and digit. So, for example, I could bid 1 0s, since that's higher than None. \n\nBut the example given in the user's message shows that when the current bid is None, the first bid is, for example, 3 5s. So the first player can choose any bid. So the 'strictly higher' in this context just means that any bid is allowed as the first move. \n\nSo given that, my strategy should be to start with a bid that's plausible based on my hand but leaves room for the opponent's possible digits. \n\nLooking back at my hand: two 7s. So perhaps bidding 3 7s. That would require the opponent to have at least one. If they have one, total is 3. If they have more, even better. If they have none, total is 2, which is less than 3. So if they challenge, I lose. But if they don't challenge and instead bid higher, the game continues. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity but higher digit. For example, 2 8s. But I have none. If the opponent has two 8s, then total is 2, which meets the bid. If they have none, then total is zero, which would lose if challenged. \n\nBut bidding on a digit I don't have is risky. So maybe better to stick with a digit I do have. \n\nAlternatively, since I have a 9, maybe bid 1 9s. But that's a very low bid. The opponent can easily raise. \n\nAlternatively, bid 4 0s. I have one 0. If the opponent has three 0s, total is four. But that's possible. \n\nBut without knowing, it's a gamble. \n\nIn the example given by the user, when the user had two 6s, they bid 4 6s. So maybe the strategy is to bid higher than your own count, assuming the opponent has some. \n\nSo applying that here, with two 7s, I could bid 4 7s. But that's a big jump. The opponent would need to have two 7s to make it 4. But if they have none, then total is two, which is less than four. That's a high risk. \n\nAlternatively, bid 3 7s. That's more conservative. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a safer approach is to bid on a higher digit with a low quantity. For example, 2 9s. I have one 9. So the opponent needs to have at least one. If they have one, total is two. If not, it's one. So if I bid 2 9s, and they have none, then the total is one, which is less than two. But if they challenge, I lose. \n\nBut maybe they are less likely to challenge a low bid. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the total possible digits are 16, and the maximum bid is 16, but starting with a low bid is safer. \n\nHmm. So perhaps the best approach is to start with a bid that's based on my hand but with a slight increase. Since I have two 7s, bidding 3 7s. That way, the opponent needs to have at least one. If they have one, total is three. If they have two, total is four. If they have none, total is two. So it's a 50/50 chance, depending on their hand. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 7s. That's a truthful bid based on my own hand, but the opponent might have more. But if I bid 2 7s, the next player can bid higher, either increasing the quantity or the digit. \n\nBut since the first bid is crucial, maybe starting with a moderate bid. \n\nAnother angle: digits that are more common in general. For example, 0, 1, or 5 might be more common in hands. But I have one 0, one 1, no 5s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid on a digit that's in the middle, like 5, even though I have none. For example, bid 2 5s. If the opponent has two 5s, that's okay. But I have none. So total would be their count. If they have two, total is two, which meets the bid. If they have less, then it's lower. \n\nBut that's a risky move. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the safest first bid is 4 0s. Wait, no, I have one 0. So the opponent needs three. That's possible but risky. \n\nAlternatively, bid 1 7s. That's very low. But then the opponent can easily raise. \n\nHmm. I think the best approach is to start with a bid that's slightly higher than my own count for a digit I have. So, with two 7s, bid 3 7s. That way, the opponent needs to have at least one. If they challenge, there's a chance they have none, but I'm hoping they have at least one. If they don't challenge, the game continues. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, I have a 9. Bid 2 9s. If the opponent has one, total is two. If not, it's one. But again, risky. \n\nAlternatively, considering that there are 16 digits total, a bid of 4 of any digit is 25% of all digits. That's a high bid. But maybe starting with a lower quantity. \n\nWait, but the first bid can be anything. So maybe starting with a low quantity and a high digit. For example, 1 9s. But that's too easy to raise. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal opening is to bid 4 0s. Since I have one, but that's a high quantity. \n\nBut I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back. \n\nMy hand: 0,9,2,1,7,7,6,4. \n\nDigits I have: 0,1,2,4,6,7,7,9. \n\nSo the digit with the highest count in my hand is 7 (two). \n\nSo a reasonable opening bid would be to bid on 7s with a quantity slightly higher than what I have. So 3 7s. That's a logical choice. It's based on my hand, and it's a moderate bid. The opponent might have one or two more, making it valid. If they challenge and have none, I lose, but that's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 7s, that's truthful but low. The opponent can then bid higher, like 3 7s or 2 8s. \n\nBut since it's the first move, I think 3 7s is a solid opening bid. It's not too aggressive but requires the opponent to at least have one 7 to be valid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 7s. But in the example given, the user bid higher than their own count. So following that strategy, maybe bid 3 7s. \n\nYes, I'll go with that. Bid 3 7s.\n"
