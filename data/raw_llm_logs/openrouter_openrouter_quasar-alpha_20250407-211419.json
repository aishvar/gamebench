For the bid to be valid, there must be at least 3 sevens across both players' hands. Since I hold two 7s, Player 1 needs to have at least one 7, which is quite plausible. Challenging now carries a significant risk. To continue strategically, I can raise the bid by increasing the digit or quantity. The safest next legal bid is 3 8s (higher digit, same quantity). Checking my hand, I have no 8s, so that would be risky. Alternatively, I can bid 4 of a digit I have many of. I have two 7s, one 9, one 4, one 6, one 3, one 0, and one 2. The only digit I have multiple of is 7. So the natural next bid is 4 7s, assuming the opponent might have 2 or more 7s, which is plausible. It is safer than challenging now.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 7\"\n}",
