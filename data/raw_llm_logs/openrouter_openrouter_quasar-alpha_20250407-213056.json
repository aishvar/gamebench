For the total number of zeros across both hands to be at least 3, the opponent would need at least 3 zeros in their hand. Since each player has 8 digits, it's statistically unlikely for the opponent to have 3 or more zeros alone, especially since I have none. The probability favors that there are fewer than 3 zeros total, making the current bid suspect.
