        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, my hand is 13167047. Let me break that down. The digits I have are 1, 3, 1, 6, 7, 0, 4, 7. So, looking at each digit:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 2\n- 3: 1\n- 4: 1\n- 6: 1\n- 7: 2\n\nSo, I have two 1s, two 7s, and one each of 0,3,4,6. \n\nThe current bid is 3 5s, made by Player 1. The bid history shows that Player 0 (me) bid 2 7s first, and then Player 1 raised it to 3 5s. \n\nNow, it's my turn. I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. \n\nLet's think about challenging first. If I challenge the bid of 3 5s, we'll reveal the total number of 5s. Since I don't have any 5s in my hand, the total number of 5s would be whatever Player 1 has. Player 1 has 8 digits as well. The maximum possible 5s they could have is 8, but the bid is 3. So, is 3 5s a reasonable bid? Well, it's possible, but not certain. If I challenge and there are at least 3, I lose. If there are less than 3, I win. But since I have no 5s, the total can't be more than 8, but the bid is 3, which is low. It's possible, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, I can make a higher bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. The current bid is 3 5s. So, I can bid 4 of a higher digit or the same digit with a higher quantity. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 7s. So maybe I can bid 4 7s. Wait, but I only have two 7s, so the total can't be more than 10 (if the other player has two 7s as well). But 4 is higher than 3, so that's a valid bid. However, I'm not sure if that's a good idea because the other player might have more 7s, making the total higher. \n\nAlternatively, I can bid a higher digit. Since 5 is the current digit, I can go to 6,7,8,9. Let's see. I have one 6, so if I bid, say, 3 6s, that would be higher than 3 5s because 6 is higher than 5. But I only have one 6, so the total could be up to 9 (if the other player has 8 6s, but that's unlikely). So, 3 6s might be a safer bet. \n\nWait, but if I bid 3 6s, and the other player has, say, two 6s, that makes four in total, which is more than 3, so the bid would hold. But if the other player has zero, then I lose. \n\nAnother option is to bid 4 5s. But I have zero 5s, so the total can't exceed 8 (if the other player has 8 5s). But 4 is higher than 3, so it's a possible bid. However, since I have no 5s, it's a bit risky because if the other player has at least 4, I lose. \n\nWait, but in Liar's Poker, the key is to make the opponent doubt whether you're bluffing. Since I have no 5s, I can't contribute to the count, so if I bid 4 5s, I'm relying on the other player not having enough. But the other player might have at least 4, making my bid fail. \n\nAlternatively, I can bid 3 6s. Since I have one 6, if the other player has two, that's three, which meets the bid. If they have more, it's even better. If they have less, I lose. \n\nSo, considering the options, I think bidding 3 6s is a good move because it's a higher digit than 5, and I have at least one in my hand. It's a moderate bid that doesn't overcommit. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 4 7s, but since I only have two, that's risky because the other player might have two, making the total four, which would make the bid valid. But if they have more, I'm fine. However, if they have one or none, the total would be three or two, which would make my bid invalid. \n\nSo, between 3 6s and 4 7s, I think 3 6s is safer because I have one, and it's a smaller number to reach. \n\nTherefore, I'll bid 3 6s.\n"
