You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, so I'm playing Liar's Poker and it's my turn. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember the rules. Each player has 8 secret digits, and we take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit across all hands. The current bid is 'None', which means I need to make the first bid. My goal is to either bid higher than the current bid or challenge it if I think it's unlikely, but since there's no bid yet, I have to start with a bid.\n\nLooking at my hand: 7,1,2,9,2,6,3,8. Let's count the digits I have. \n\n- 7: 1\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 9: 1\n- 6: 1\n- 3: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nSo, the digits I have are 7,1,2,9,6,3,8, with 2 appearing twice. The other digits (0,4,5) I don't have.\n\nSince I'm starting, I need to make an initial bid. The bid must be strictly higher than 'None', so the first bid can be any quantity and digit, but it's better to make a bid that's likely to be true to avoid being challenged early.\n\nConsidering the possible digits, I should think about which digits are more common. But since all hands are secret, it's a bit of a guess. However, I can base my bid on the digits I have and maybe consider what others might have.\n\nI have two 2s, which is higher than the others. Maybe I can bid on 2s. If I bid 3 2s, that would mean I'm claiming there are at least three 2s in total. Since I have two, maybe the other player has one. It's a reasonable bid, not too high, but still a valid starting point.\n\nAlternatively, I could choose a higher digit with a lower quantity, but since I have two 2s, it might be safer to go with that. Plus, starting with a lower digit might allow me to increase the digit in subsequent bids if needed.\n\nWait, but the rules say that a bid must be strictly higher than the current bid. Since the current bid is 'None', any bid is acceptable, but it's better to choose a bid that's likely to be correct. Bidding 3 2s seems reasonable because I have two, and the other player might have one.\n\nSo, I think I'll go with bidding 3 2s. That way, I'm starting the bidding process, and it's based on the digits I have, increasing the chances that the bid is correct.\n"
