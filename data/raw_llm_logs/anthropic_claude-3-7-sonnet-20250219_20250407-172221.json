Since I have 0 sevens, this means Player 0 must have at least 2 sevens in their hand for this bid to be valid. This is entirely possible, as they could have multiple 7s. Given that this is the first bid and it\\'s relatively conservative (only claiming 2 out of a possible 16 digits), challenging would be risky. Instead, I should make a higher bid. I can either bid more 7s or switch to a different digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s, so I know there are at least 2 nines in the game.
