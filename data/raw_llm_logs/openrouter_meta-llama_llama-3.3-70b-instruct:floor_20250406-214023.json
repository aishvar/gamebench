        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 3s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since I only have one 3, bidding higher on 3s might not be the best strategy without knowing the other player's hand. However, I can try to increase the quantity or the digit. Given my hand does not offer a clear advantage in any particular digit to safely increase the quantity significantly, I should consider challenging or making a strategic bid. Challenging seems risky without more information about the opponent's hand, but making a bid that is too high could also backfire. A moderate increase, considering the digits I have and their potential distribution, seems prudent. I have two 1s and other unique digits, but increasing to a higher digit like 4 or more might be risky. Noticing I have no 4s but do have digits that could potentially match or exceed a bid of 3 in other numbers, I could consider bidding on a different digit or challenging if I felt the current bid was highly unlikely. Given my hand and the goal to make a higher bid, I must weigh the risks and potential rewards. Since my hand doesn't strongly support a significantly higher bid in any specific digit without more information, and considering the rules of the game, I should look for a digit that could reasonably have a higher count when combined with the opponent's hand. However, without clear evidence to safely make a much higher bid, I must decide based on the information I have and the potential for the opponent's hand to contribute to the total count of any digit.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 1s\"\n}",
