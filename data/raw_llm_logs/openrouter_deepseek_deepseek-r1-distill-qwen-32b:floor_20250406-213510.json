You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, my hand is 83975720. Let me count the digits I have:\n\n- 8: appears once\n- 3: once\n- 9: once\n- 7: twice\n- 5: once\n- 2: once\n- 0: once\n\nSo, in my hand, I have one 9. The current bid is 2 9s from Player 0. Now, I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid.\n\nIf I challenge, we'll reveal the total number of 9s. If there are at least 2, Player 0 wins. If not, I win. But I have one 9, so I'm not sure how many Player 0 has. It's possible they have another 9, making the total 2. Alternatively, they might be lying.\n\nBut considering the rules, the bid must be strictly higher. So, if I don't challenge, I have to bid higher than 2 9s. That could mean either increasing the quantity or the digit. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 7s. Maybe I can bid 3 7s. That way, I'm increasing the quantity from 2 to 3 and the digit from 9 to 7, which is actually lower. Wait, no, higher digit is better. So, 3 7s is higher than 2 9s because 3 > 2, even though 7 is lower than 9. Wait, no, higher quantity makes it a higher bid regardless of the digit. So, 3 7s would be a valid higher bid than 2 9s because 3 > 2.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 8s, which is the same quantity but a higher digit. But I only have one 8 in my hand. So, if I bid 2 8s, I'm assuming Player 0 has another 8. But I don't know that for sure.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 5s, but I only have one 5. That might be risky.\n\nWait, another option: bid 3 0s. I have one 0, so if Player 0 has two 0s, that would make 3. But that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should challenge the bid. Since the current bid is 2 9s, and I have one 9, it's possible that Player 0 also has one 9, making the total 2. But if they don't have another 9, then challenging would make me win.\n\nBut I'm not sure. If I challenge, and the total is exactly 2, Player 0 wins. If it's less than 2, I win. Since I have one 9, the total could be 1 or 2. If Player 0 has none, then total is 1, and challenging would win. If they have one, total is 2, and challenging would lose.\n\nSo, it's a bit risky. Alternatively, making a bid might be safer.\n\nLet me think about the possible bids. I have two 7s. So, if I bid 3 7s, I'm assuming that between both players, there are at least three 7s. I have two, so I'm assuming Player 0 has at least one. That might be a reasonable assumption, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 8s. Since I have one 8, I'm assuming Player 0 has another. That's possible, but again, I'm not sure.\n\nAnother option is to bid 4 7s. I have two, so I'm assuming Player 0 has two more. That seems too high.\n\nWait, the maximum possible is 16. So, 2 9s is low. Maybe I can bid 3 9s, but that would require me to have two more 9s, which I don't. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 8s. I have one, so I'm assuming Player 0 has two. That might be a stretch.\n\nHmm, maybe challenging is better. If I challenge, and the total is 2, I lose. If it's 1, I win. Since I have one, and I don't know about Player 0, it's a 50-50 chance. But maybe it's better to take the risk here.\n\nAlternatively, making a bid that I'm more confident about. Let's see, I have two 7s. If I bid 3 7s, I'm assuming Player 0 has at least one 7. That's possible. Maybe they have one or two. It's a bit of a gamble, but perhaps safer than challenging.\n\nWait, but if I bid 3 7s, and the total is exactly 3, then the bid is valid, and I win. If it's less, I lose. So, I need to assess the likelihood.\n\nI have two 7s, so Player 0 has 8 digits. The chance that they have at least one 7 is 1 - (8/10)^8, which is roughly 1 - 0.167 = 0.833. So, about 83% chance they have at least one 7. So, the total would be 3. That seems reasonable.\n\nSo, maybe bidding 3 7s is a good move. It's a higher bid than 2 9s, and I have some confidence in it.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 4 7s, but that would require Player 0 to have two 7s, which is less likely. So, 3 7s seems safer.\n\nWait, but the current bid is 2 9s. So, I need to make a bid that is strictly higher. 3 7s is higher because 3 > 2, even though 7 < 9. So, that's valid.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 8s, which is higher because 8 > 9 is false, but same quantity. Wait, no, higher digit makes it higher if the quantity is the same. So, 2 8s is higher than 2 9s? No, wait, higher digit is better. So, 2 9s is higher than 2 8s. So, I can't bid 2 8s because it's lower than 2 9s.\n\nWait, no, higher digit is better. So, to make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or, if same quantity, increase the digit. So, 2 9s is the current bid. To make a higher bid, I can either go to 3 of any digit, or 2 of a digit higher than 9, which isn't possible because digits go up to 9. So, the only way is to increase the quantity.\n\nSo, I have to bid at least 3 of some digit. So, my options are to bid 3 of a digit, which can be any digit, but I need to choose one where I have some confidence.\n\nI have two 7s, so 3 7s seems possible. Alternatively, I could bid 3 8s, but I only have one 8. So, that's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 5s, but I only have one 5.\n\nAlternatively, 3 2s, but I have one 2.\n\nHmm, maybe 3 7s is the best option because I have two, so I'm only needing one more from Player 0.\n\nSo, I think I'll go with bidding 3 7s.\n"
