You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of \"3 8s.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at my own hand. My digits are 9, 0, 8, 6, 0, 3, 1, 3. Let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\n- 0s: 2\n- 1s: 1\n- 3s: 2\n- 6s: 1\n- 8s: 1\n- 9s: 1\n\nSo, I have one 8 in my hand. The current bid is 3 8s, which means the total number of 8s in both players' hands combined needs to be at least 3. Since I have one, the other player must have at least two for the bid to be valid. \n\nNow, considering the maximum number of 8s possible. Each player has 8 digits, so the maximum any digit can have is 16. But in reality, it's much lower. The current bid is 3, so the question is whether the total is at least 3.\n\nI have one 8. If the other player has two, that makes three. But if they have more, then the bid is still valid. However, if they have only one or none, then the bid is invalid. \n\nI don't have any information about the opponent's hand, so I have to make an educated guess. The opponent started with a bid of 3 8s. Maybe they have two 8s, thinking that I have one, making the total three. Or maybe they have three, trying to get me to fold.\n\nBut wait, if I challenge and the total is 3 or more, I lose. If it's less than 3, I win. Given that I have one, the opponent needs to have at least two for the bid to be good. \n\nIs it likely that the opponent has two 8s? Well, in a random distribution, the chance that they have two 8s is not very high. There are 9 possible digits, so the probability of any specific digit being in their hand decreases as the quantity increases. \n\nAlternatively, I could try to bid higher. Since the current bid is 3 8s, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. For example, I could bid 4 8s, but that's risky because I only have one. Or I could bid the same quantity but a higher digit, like 3 9s. But I only have one 9, so that might not be safe either.\n\nWait, looking back, I have two 0s. Maybe I can bid on 0s. The current bid is 3 8s. If I bid 4 0s, that's a higher quantity, so it's a valid bid. But do I think there are at least four 0s in total? I have two, so the opponent would need at least two. That's possible, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 3s. I have two, so if the opponent has one, that makes three. But I'm not sure if that's a good move.\n\nBut considering the risk, challenging might be safer. If I challenge and the total is less than 3, I win. If it's 3 or more, I lose. Given that I have one, the opponent needs two. The chance that they have two might be lower than I think.\n\nSo, weighing the options, I think challenging is the better move here. It's a 50-50 gamble, but considering the possible outcomes, it's worth the risk.\n"
