For the bid to be true, Player 0 must have at least four 2s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having four or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is extremely low (approximately 0.5%). Since I hold none of the bid digit, the likelihood of the current bid being true is very small. Making a higher bid, such as '4 3s' or '4 4s', is also risky. While I have two 4s and two 7s, bidding '4 4s' or '4 7s' relies on Player 0 having at least two of that digit, which is not guaranteed (probability ~18.7%). Challenging the current bid of '4 2s' has a very high probability of success.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
