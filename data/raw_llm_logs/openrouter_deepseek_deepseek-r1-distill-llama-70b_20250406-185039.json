        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. The game state shows that there's been no bid yet, so the current bid is None. My hand is 26707201, which I need to analyze. \n\nFirst, I should count how many of each digit I have. Let's break it down:\n\n- 2: appears once\n- 6: appears twice\n- 7: appears once\n- 0: appears twice\n- 1: appears once\n\nSo, the digits I have are 2, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0, 1. That's seven digits, but wait, the user message says my hand is 26707201, which is eight digits. Let me recount:\n\nDigits in 26707201 are: 2, 6, 7, 0, 7, 2, 0, 1. Oh, I see, I miscounted earlier. So:\n\n- 2: appears twice\n- 6: once\n- 7: twice\n- 0: twice\n- 1: once\n\nSo, I have two 2s, one 6, two 7s, two 0s, and one 1.\n\nSince the current bid is None, I can start by bidding any quantity and digit. The goal is to make a bid that's likely to be valid but also gives me an advantage. \n\nLooking at my hand, the highest number of a single digit I have is two. So, I can bid 2 of some digit. But which digit? I have two 2s, two 7s, and two 0s. \n\nConsidering that higher digits are generally riskier because the opponent might have more of lower digits, but in this case, since it's the first bid, maybe starting with a lower digit is safer. Alternatively, choosing a digit that's less likely to be common might be better.\n\nWait, but since I have two 0s, and 0 is a lower digit, maybe starting with 2 0s is a good move. It's a low quantity and a low digit, making it harder for the opponent to challenge because it's more plausible. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 5s, but I don't have any 5s, so that might be risky. Or 2 7s, which I do have, but 7 is a higher digit. If I bid 2 7s, the opponent might think it's possible, but since I have two, it's a safe bet. \n\nBut since the bid can be any, maybe I should choose a digit that's less likely to be in the opponent's hand. For example, 0s are common in some cases, but maybe not as much as other digits. Alternatively, 7s are less common, so bidding 2 7s could be a good start.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 2s since I have two of them. That might be a safe bet as well. \n\nI think the safest move is to bid 2 of a digit I have. Between 2, 7, and 0, I think 2 is a moderate digit. So, I'll go with BID: 2 2s. Alternatively, 2 0s might be safer because 0s can be more common, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but the opponent might have more 0s, so if I bid 2 0s, and the total is 2 or more, I win. But if I have two and the opponent has none, it's exactly two, so it's valid. If the opponent has more, it's still valid. So, 2 0s is a safe bet.\n\nAlternatively, since I have two 7s, and 7 is a high digit, maybe the opponent is less likely to have many, so bidding 2 7s could be better because it's more specific and less likely to be challenged.\n\nBut since it's the first bid, maybe starting with a lower digit is better to set a lower bar. So, I think I'll go with BID: 2 0s. It's a low quantity and a low digit, making it harder to challenge because it's more likely to be true.\n\nAnother thought: since I have two 0s, two 2s, and two 7s, I could choose any. But 0s are more likely to be present in the opponent's hand as well, so the total could easily be 2 or more. Therefore, bidding 2 0s is a good starting point.\n"
