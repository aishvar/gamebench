        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since my hand contains two 7s and other digits, bidding on a digit I have the most of seems like a safe start. However, considering the nature of Liar's Poker, starting with a lower quantity and a digit that appears less frequently might be more strategic to avoid immediate challenges. My hand has two 7s, but starting with the highest digit I have multiple of might not be the best strategy. Instead, I'll choose a digit that appears and is not too high to avoid overbidding, considering the total possible count of any digit across both hands is 16. Given these considerations, bidding on one of my less frequent digits or a lower quantity of a more frequent digit could be wise. Since I have at least two of several digits, I could bid on one of those, but given the goal is to make a bid that is reasonable and not too high, starting with a lower quantity and a digit that is present but not overly abundant seems prudent.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 7s\"\n}",
