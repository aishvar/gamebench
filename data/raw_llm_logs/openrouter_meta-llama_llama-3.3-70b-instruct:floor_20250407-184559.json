Since I only have one '0', I know that the total number of '0s' across both hands cannot exceed 7 (assuming the other player has the maximum possible number of '0s', which is 6, since I have 1). However, I don't have enough information to accurately estimate the number of '0s' the other player has. Considering the bidding history, the other player has already bid '3 0s', which suggests they might have at least one '0' or are trying to bluff. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and the current bid is relatively low, I should consider bidding a higher quantity of the same digit or moving to the next digit. Since I have one '0' and it's difficult to determine the exact number of '0s' the other player has without more information, a safe strategy would be to increase the digit, as increasing the quantity of '0s' could be risky without knowing the other player's hand. My hand contains two '1s', '2s', '3s', '5s', and '7s' are less frequent, and '4', '6', '8', '9' are absent or less frequent. A bid of '2 1s' would be a valid move as it exceeds the current bid by digit, and given my hand, it's plausible that together we could have at least two '1s'.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 1\"\n}\n```",
