        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since I need to make a bid that is strictly higher than '2 9s', I must consider either increasing the quantity of 9s, which seems risky without having any 9s in my hand, or bidding on a higher digit with the same or higher quantity. However, without knowing the distribution of digits in the other player's hand, any bid involving a higher digit than 9 is not possible since 9 is the highest digit. Thus, my safest option to ensure a higher bid is to increase the quantity of the digit 9, despite not having any in my hand, hoping the other player also doesn't have enough to meet the bid, or to challenge if I think the current bid is unlikely. Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and considering the risk, a more strategic move might be to challenge the current bid if it seems implausible, but since I have no information suggesting '2 9s' is implausible and I must bid higher, increasing the quantity while keeping the digit the same seems like the logical step.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 9s\"\n}",
