        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn to make the first bid. My hand is 84958401. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since there are no previous bids, I can start by bidding anything. But I need to make a smart choice. I should look at my own hand to see which digits I have and how many of each.\n\nLooking at my hand: 8,4,9,5,8,4,0,1. Let me count each digit. \n\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 1\n- 4: 2\n- 5: 1\n- 8: 2\n- 9: 1\n\nSo, the digits I have are 0,1,4,5,8,9. The highest frequency I have is 2 for both 4 and 8. \n\nIn Liar's Poker, since each player has 8 digits, the total possible for any digit is up to 16 (if both players have 8 of the same digit, which is impossible, but the maximum any single digit can have is 16). But realistically, it's much lower.\n\nSince I have two 8s, I can consider bidding on 8s. But I don't know what the opponent has. If I bid 2 8s, it's a safe start because I have two, and the opponent could have zero or more. Alternatively, I could bid higher, but that might be risky.\n\nWait, but in the first bid, I can set the tone. If I bid 2 8s, it's a low bid, and the opponent might challenge it if they think there aren't that many. But if I have two, and the opponent has none, the total would be 2, which meets the bid. If the opponent has one, it's 3, which is still good.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I have more of. But I don't have any digit more than two. So 2 8s is a good starting point. It's not too high, and I can see how the opponent reacts. If they challenge, I might win because I have two. If they bid higher, I can adjust accordingly.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I should bid on a digit that's less likely to be present in high numbers. But since I don't have any information about the opponent's hand, it's safer to bid based on what I have.\n\nSo, I think I'll start by bidding 2 8s. It's a reasonable bid, not too high, and based on my own hand. Plus, if the opponent challenges, I have a good chance of winning because I have two 8s.\n"
