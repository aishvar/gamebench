You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s.

Considering the opponent's hand might have some 0s, but since they increased their own bid from 4 0s to 5 0s, they might be bluffing. However, challenging here is risky because if they have even one more 0, the total would be 2, which is less than 5. Wait, no\u2014the total count of 0s in all hands includes both players. My hand has one 0, so if the opponent has at least four 0s, the bid is valid. But having four 0s in their 8-digit hand is possible but unlikely. Since the maximum quantity is 16, 5 is not extremely high, but given the previous bids, they might be trying to push. Alternatively, I can bid higher. To bid higher, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. If I bid 5 1s, that's same quantity but higher digit. Do I have any 1s? My hand is 4,1,5,6,4,7,9,7. I have one 1. But the total number of 1s could be more than 5? If I have one, the opponent might have some. But it's uncertain. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 6, but with a lower digit. For example, 6 0s. But if I don't have confidence in 6 0s, that's risky. Alternatively, maybe 5 2s. But I don't have any 2s. Wait, the key is to make a valid higher bid based on my hand and the situation. Since the current bid is 5 0s, and I have one 0, maybe the total is 1 (mine) plus opponent's. If they have four 0s, total is 5. But that's exactly the bid. If they have three, total is 4, which is less. So the bid could be a bluff. But challenging here would win if the total is less than 5. Since I have one 0, the opponent needs to have at least four 0s. Given that each player has 8 digits, having four 0s is possible but not very likely. So maybe challenging is a good move here. Alternatively, if I can make a higher bid that I can support. For example, if I bid 5 1s. Since I have one 1, maybe the total is higher. But without knowing the opponent's hand, it's hard to tell. Another approach: since the opponent increased their own bid from 4 0s to 5 0s, they might be trying to intimidate. If I challenge and win, I gain an advantage. Considering the risk and reward, challenging might be better here. Because if the total 0s are 5 or more, they win, but if it's less, I win. Given that I have one 0, the opponent needs four. It's possible, but maybe not probable. So I'll choose to challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
